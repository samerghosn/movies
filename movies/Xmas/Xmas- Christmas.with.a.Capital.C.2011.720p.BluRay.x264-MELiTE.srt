1
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,497
Big truck's
comin' up through here.

2
00:01:34,817 --> 00:01:37,734
Ah, it'd be a mess
of potholes come spring.

3
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:40,451
Yeah.

4
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:45,245
Is someone new
moving into town?

5
00:01:45,565 --> 00:01:48,001
Haven't heard anything yet.

6
00:01:59,191 --> 00:02:01,228
I just want more hay.

7
00:02:01,509 --> 00:02:02,866
You what?

8
00:02:03,187 --> 00:02:04,504
I want more hay.

9
00:02:04,785 --> 00:02:05,703
Oh, who's this?

10
00:02:06,024 --> 00:02:08,939
Look at this.

11
00:02:09,219 --> 00:02:10,338
Whoa!

12
00:02:10,618 --> 00:02:12,215
Well, well, well, if it isn't
the Reed brothers.

13
00:02:12,496 --> 00:02:13,455
I've been lookin' for you boys.

14
00:02:13,776 --> 00:02:15,093
Do my eyes deceive me?

15
00:02:15,374 --> 00:02:17,290
You know, I heard
you were mayor,

16
00:02:17,611 --> 00:02:18,888
but it turns out
you're the handyman.

17
00:02:19,169 --> 00:02:21,566
Funny, you can't trust
a rumor mill, can you?

18
00:02:21,847 --> 00:02:24,243
Mitch Bright.

19
00:02:24,564 --> 00:02:27,760
Well, when you're
the mayor of a small town,

20
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:30,755
you got to wear
a lot of different hats.

21
00:02:32,355 --> 00:02:33,712
You buildin' a new edition?

22
00:02:33,993 --> 00:02:35,550
You're funny.

23
00:02:35,831 --> 00:02:38,867
We're buildin' a platform
for the town Christmas display.

24
00:02:39,188 --> 00:02:41,545
You might remember it, huh?

25
00:02:41,825 --> 00:02:44,222
I don't know, we just
figured after five decades,

26
00:02:44,503 --> 00:02:47,618
the mother of God deserved
a proper place to kneel.

27
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:48,777
It's only right.

28
00:02:49,098 --> 00:02:50,615
All the statues
and everything?
Yeah, right.

29
00:02:50,936 --> 00:02:52,094
I remember that.

30
00:02:52,373 --> 00:02:53,611
So how you guys doin'?

31
00:02:53,932 --> 00:02:55,529
Good.
Wow.

32
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:57,447
How long has it been?

33
00:02:57,768 --> 00:02:59,684
I'm thinkin'

34
00:03:00,845 --> 00:03:02,762
What brings you
to town, Mitch?
some hotshot attorney--

35
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,477
Oh, he's loaded now.

36
00:03:06,758 --> 00:03:07,637
Who struck it rich.

37
00:03:07,917 --> 00:03:09,674
Yeah, I've made some
good investments, you know,

38
00:03:09,955 --> 00:03:11,552
but I miss the old town.

39
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:14,549
Thought maybe I'd come back
and check out the old place,

40
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,466
you know, see some
of my old friends.

41
00:03:16,747 --> 00:03:19,104
Hey, how's Kristen doing?

42
00:03:19,384 --> 00:03:21,501
Here it comes.

43
00:03:21,782 --> 00:03:23,459
She's good.

44
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,736
Our kids are good too.
mean anything by it.

45
00:03:27,935 --> 00:03:29,493
I--you know,
I was just bein' polite.

46
00:03:29,814 --> 00:03:32,450
Look, we're not in high school
anymore, Dan.

47
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:34,768
Look, I got to run.

48
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:37,125
I've got a big moving van
with all my stuff in it,

49
00:03:37,406 --> 00:03:39,082
gonna take a look
at the old house.

50
00:03:39,363 --> 00:03:40,600
I'm sure I'll be seein'
you boys around though.

51
00:03:40,881 --> 00:03:42,159
Oh, yes, you will.

52
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:44,077
All right.

53
00:03:46,036 --> 00:03:47,553
Moving van?

54
00:03:47,834 --> 00:03:50,470
Isn't exactly a home
for the holidays.

55
00:03:50,751 --> 00:03:54,586
Hey, you want me
to follow him?

56
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,337
Pretty good, huh?

57
00:04:02,618 --> 00:04:03,975
Not bad.

58
00:04:04,256 --> 00:04:05,374
Not a winning time, but--

59
00:04:05,655 --> 00:04:07,692
Want me to time you?

60
00:04:08,013 --> 00:04:09,570
No, I don't want
to hold you up.

61
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:11,208
I can wait.

62
00:04:11,488 --> 00:04:13,525
I'm just takin'
it easy today.

63
00:04:13,846 --> 00:04:15,124
Christmas Cup is coming up.

64
00:04:15,405 --> 00:04:16,842
You entering?
Of course.

65
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:21,717
Me too.
Good luck.

66
00:04:29,789 --> 00:04:31,586
I'm gonna be the angel!

67
00:04:31,867 --> 00:04:33,464
You already are an angel.

68
00:04:33,745 --> 00:04:34,982
In the Christmas program,
Dad.

69
00:04:35,303 --> 00:04:36,501
That means I get lines.

70
00:04:36,782 --> 00:04:38,539
Wow, lines.

71
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,937
All the other kids
just have to sing,

72
00:04:40,258 --> 00:04:43,134
but I get to say stuff
too, and wear a costume.

73
00:04:43,415 --> 00:04:46,531
Oh, I am so glad
you're home.

74
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:49,566
Can you help set the table?

75
00:04:49,887 --> 00:04:55,001
I have people
who do that for me.

76
00:04:55,282 --> 00:04:56,559
What happened?

77
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,998
What do you mean?

78
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:00,076
You onlyjoke about your lack
of actual power

79
00:05:00,357 --> 00:05:02,034
when you've had
a run-in at work.

80
00:05:02,314 --> 00:05:03,751
Is that true?

81
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:08,826
Hmm, well,
nothing happened.

82
00:05:10,385 --> 00:05:12,062
Okay.

83
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:20,453
Mitch Bright
stopped by town today.

84
00:05:20,734 --> 00:05:22,412
High school Mitch Bright?

85
00:05:22,692 --> 00:05:23,770
Mm-hmm.

86
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:25,728
Is he the rich guy?

87
00:05:27,607 --> 00:05:30,283
When I was waiting
for you at school,

88
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:32,600
all the other teachers
were talking about it.

89
00:05:32,921 --> 00:05:35,557
Somebody saw him
in a big moving van.

90
00:05:35,878 --> 00:05:37,355
I thought you
were supposed to be

91
00:05:37,676 --> 00:05:38,994
your mother's
teacher assistant?

92
00:05:39,274 --> 00:05:40,592
She won't let me
grade the papers.

93
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:41,990
Ooh.

94
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,389
So he had
a big moving van?

95
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:44,587
Mm-hmm.

96
00:05:44,868 --> 00:05:45,987
Hey, where's Cody?

97
00:05:46,267 --> 00:05:47,585
Cody, dinner's ready!

98
00:05:47,865 --> 00:05:49,942
He says he's home
for the holidays.

99
00:05:50,223 --> 00:05:52,739
Yeah, but his family
hasn't been here in years.

100
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,256
Yeah, I know.

101
00:05:55,537 --> 00:05:58,612
Seems highly suspect.

102
00:05:58,893 --> 00:06:01,329
Well, you think we should
invite him for dinner?

103
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,687
Oh, no, I don't think we can
feed him in the manner to which

104
00:06:04,008 --> 00:06:05,126
he has become accustomed.

105
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:06,724
Oh, come on.

106
00:06:08,603 --> 00:06:09,641
Yes, you do.

107
00:06:09,962 --> 00:06:12,478
Cody!
Oh, hi honey, sorry.

108
00:06:12,798 --> 00:06:13,757
Okay.

109
00:06:14,037 --> 00:06:16,474
All right.

110
00:06:18,672 --> 00:06:20,029
Hey, what's wrong
with you?

111
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,826
All the girls are reading
these vampire books.

112
00:06:23,746 --> 00:06:24,904
I don't get it.

113
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:27,621
He wants the girls
to be in love with him instead.

114
00:06:27,902 --> 00:06:29,619
Okay, all right.

115
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,178
Listen, your mom
read all those books.

116
00:06:31,499 --> 00:06:32,776
I know exactly how you feel.

117
00:06:33,057 --> 00:06:36,572
Mmm, can we please find
something to thank God for?

118
00:06:36,852 --> 00:06:38,969
Yes.
I get to be the angel.

119
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,486
It's gonna be the best
Christmas ever.

120
00:06:58,229 --> 00:07:00,626
That was fast.

121
00:07:00,907 --> 00:07:02,385
Thanks for lettin' me drive.

122
00:07:02,706 --> 00:07:04,062
Yeah.

123
00:07:04,343 --> 00:07:06,180
That's the last time.

124
00:07:19,846 --> 00:07:22,243
So who's that guy you were
talking about last night?

125
00:07:22,524 --> 00:07:23,482
Mitch Bright.

126
00:07:23,763 --> 00:07:26,677
Just a guy
from back in the day.

127
00:07:28,037 --> 00:07:30,833
We didn't get along
too well unfortunately.

128
00:07:31,114 --> 00:07:34,149
You had a high school rival?

129
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,469
Yeah, why?

130
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:38,226
What's so unusual
about that?

131
00:07:38,507 --> 00:07:41,382
Just seems like
everybody likes you.

132
00:07:41,703 --> 00:07:44,899
You need to go to some
city council meetings.

133
00:07:46,298 --> 00:07:48,016
So what did you
guys compete over?

134
00:07:48,336 --> 00:07:50,372
Oh, everything.

135
00:07:50,652 --> 00:07:55,366
Football, basketball, skiing,
running, class offices,

136
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:59,523
parking spaces...mom.

137
00:07:59,804 --> 00:08:01,481
Mom?

138
00:08:01,761 --> 00:08:03,199
I won that one.

139
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:04,438
Really?

140
00:08:04,719 --> 00:08:10,431
Your mom was
the girl in high school.

141
00:08:10,712 --> 00:08:13,587
Still is.

142
00:08:15,226 --> 00:08:17,903
Now you're lucky if you made
it this far without a rival,

143
00:08:18,183 --> 00:08:20,980
without someone to push you
and try to beat you

144
00:08:21,261 --> 00:08:23,057
at what you're good at.

145
00:08:23,338 --> 00:08:25,255
I didn't say that.

146
00:08:25,576 --> 00:08:26,773
Really?

147
00:08:28,213 --> 00:08:30,930
Somebody's givin' you trouble?

148
00:08:31,249 --> 00:08:35,484
My situation's a lot
different than yours.

149
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,602
Yours seems a lot easier.

150
00:08:37,882 --> 00:08:39,240
Of course.

151
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,517
Of course yours is worse.

152
00:08:42,598 --> 00:08:45,553
How is yours worse?

153
00:08:45,834 --> 00:08:48,190
Mine's a girl.

154
00:08:48,471 --> 00:08:50,308
Okay.

155
00:08:53,626 --> 00:08:55,143
Morning.

156
00:08:55,424 --> 00:08:57,102
Good mornin'.

157
00:08:57,381 --> 00:08:59,937
Can I get a cafe Americano
with soy, please?

158
00:09:00,218 --> 00:09:01,776
Sure.

159
00:09:02,057 --> 00:09:05,252
Hey, now Josie,
how's business?

160
00:09:05,572 --> 00:09:07,249
I can't complain.

161
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:08,649
Customers are loyal.

162
00:09:08,929 --> 00:09:11,446
What do you think it
would take to make it better?

163
00:09:11,726 --> 00:09:13,843
More customers, I guess.

164
00:09:14,123 --> 00:09:15,441
Exactly.

165
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,919
You know, I have some ideas
on how I think

166
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,397
I can make that happen.

167
00:09:19,678 --> 00:09:21,035
You interested?

168
00:09:21,315 --> 00:09:22,433
Sure.

169
00:09:22,714 --> 00:09:23,591
Good.

170
00:09:28,627 --> 00:09:33,063
Man, Christmas
is an awesome time of year,

171
00:09:33,342 --> 00:09:34,421
am I right?

172
00:09:34,742 --> 00:09:36,259
Hey, Santa.

173
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:37,858
No, really.
I mean, think about it,

174
00:09:38,138 --> 00:09:39,855
this is
the only time of year

175
00:09:40,136 --> 00:09:43,531
the entire world has this like
shared experience of peace

176
00:09:43,812 --> 00:09:48,485
and hope for the future and
strangers are lovin' each other.

177
00:09:48,766 --> 00:09:51,842
And there's that somethin'
in the air, man, it's something.

178
00:09:59,156 --> 00:10:00,713
What is wrong with you?

179
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:02,271
It's been a great week, man.

180
00:10:02,552 --> 00:10:03,430
Are you kiddin' me?

181
00:10:03,711 --> 00:10:07,345
We had two ice fishermen
and the snow machine tool.

182
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:14,337
Kristen invited Mitch to our
Christmas party Sunday night.

183
00:10:14,658 --> 00:10:17,454
She said it was
the Christian thing to do.

184
00:10:17,775 --> 00:10:20,172
Man, why does Kristen
always have to be right?

185
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,650
Yeah.

186
00:10:23,449 --> 00:10:26,245
I know he's got an angle.

187
00:10:26,566 --> 00:10:31,959
Now why would he come back
here after so many years?

188
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:35,674
What's he after?

189
00:10:35,955 --> 00:10:37,433
I don't know.

190
00:10:37,713 --> 00:10:40,150
Maybe he's just weary
of his city life

191
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:43,506
and he wants to return
to the simple town of his youth.

192
00:10:43,787 --> 00:10:46,544
Or he's still mad at ya
after all the times you beat him

193
00:10:46,864 --> 00:10:48,342
in high school.

194
00:10:48,622 --> 00:10:50,579
And so after festering
for 20 years,

195
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,216
he's returned
to exact his revenge.

196
00:10:56,414 --> 00:10:57,931
Yeah, you know, could
you back to singing?

197
00:10:58,211 --> 00:11:00,408
Because you're
a lot less annoying.

198
00:11:00,729 --> 00:11:03,205
Thanks for the help.

199
00:11:07,762 --> 00:11:10,478
Well, it's getting late.

200
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:14,354
You know I wasn't arguing
about your policies.

201
00:11:14,634 --> 00:11:17,030
It's--well, it's
more your approach.

202
00:11:17,351 --> 00:11:18,948
I don't know
what you mean.

203
00:11:19,269 --> 00:11:20,986
I think the mistake that
you're making is assuming

204
00:11:21,266 --> 00:11:22,864
that you're every man.

205
00:11:23,184 --> 00:11:26,860
I find your ideals to be wildly
conservative compared

206
00:11:27,141 --> 00:11:29,138
to the rest of the country.

207
00:11:29,418 --> 00:11:31,295
This is comin' from the guy
that went to Berkeley

208
00:11:31,576 --> 00:11:33,053
and lived in San Francisco
for 1 0 years,

209
00:11:33,334 --> 00:11:37,568
'cause when I think every man,
I think San Francisco.

210
00:11:39,447 --> 00:11:42,362
When's the last time
you left Alaska?

211
00:11:42,683 --> 00:11:43,762
I don't know, Mitch.

212
00:11:44,042 --> 00:11:45,799
I've been so busy buildin'
bomb shelters

213
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,397
and publishing
conspiracy papers

214
00:11:48,678 --> 00:11:50,435
that I haven't had time
to get out.

215
00:11:50,715 --> 00:11:53,072
Look, just 'cause we're
the 49th state doesn't make us

216
00:11:53,393 --> 00:11:54,550
a third world.

217
00:11:54,831 --> 00:11:57,227
Look, there is a surprising
amount of hocus-pocus here.

218
00:11:57,508 --> 00:12:00,265
Oh, you mean--what,
Native religion?

219
00:12:00,545 --> 00:12:01,901
No, I mean Christianity.

220
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,099
Well, it seems I recall you
competing with Dan

221
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,577
for president of the youth group
back in the day.

222
00:12:06,897 --> 00:12:08,694
Well, there isn't much I
wouldn't compete with Dan about,

223
00:12:10,414 --> 00:12:12,731
So, that was an act?

224
00:12:13,012 --> 00:12:14,169
No, not an act.

225
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:17,406
Look, ifyou had an opportunity
to travel the world as I have,

226
00:12:17,727 --> 00:12:19,604
you would know that
American culture is not limited

227
00:12:19,884 --> 00:12:22,401
to this small town bubble
that you live in.

228
00:12:22,721 --> 00:12:28,553
America is vast and diverse
and loving, peaceful, tolerant.

229
00:12:28,834 --> 00:12:31,750
Yeah, no, I'm just--
I'm trying to understand

230
00:12:32,031 --> 00:12:34,388
what you're implying.

231
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:36,745
I would be willing to wager
that a majority of the people

232
00:12:37,025 --> 00:12:40,581
in this town find your
religious piety annoying.

233
00:12:40,862 --> 00:12:41,859
Annoying?

234
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,298
Yes.

235
00:12:43,579 --> 00:12:45,416
And they reelect me because?

236
00:12:45,697 --> 00:12:47,692
Well, you ran unopposed
in the last two elections, Dan.

237
00:12:48,013 --> 00:12:50,490
Because he's doing
such a good job.

238
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:51,928
Yes.

239
00:12:52,209 --> 00:12:55,964
I'm sure he is
in a very small town way.

240
00:12:56,244 --> 00:12:58,362
I don't agree
with you, Mitch.

241
00:12:58,682 --> 00:13:00,400
Just because God's out ofvogue
in the big city doesn't mean

242
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,316
we throw him away like last
summer's fashion magazine.

243
00:13:03,637 --> 00:13:04,675
Maybe you wouldn't.

244
00:13:04,956 --> 00:13:06,553
Maybe a lot of your
close friends

245
00:13:06,834 --> 00:13:08,391
that were here tonight wouldn't.

246
00:13:08,672 --> 00:13:13,505
But I guess there's
no way to prove it, is there?

247
00:13:13,785 --> 00:13:18,660
You know, maybe I would
make a good mayor someday.

248
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,138
You might.

249
00:13:20,418 --> 00:13:21,497
Yeah, I kinda like that.

250
00:13:21,778 --> 00:13:24,813
Mayor Mitch Bright.
Has a ring to it.

251
00:13:25,134 --> 00:13:26,252
Good night!

252
00:13:26,533 --> 00:13:28,489
Good night.

253
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:35,801
Hey!

254
00:13:36,082 --> 00:13:37,799
Hey, sweetie.

255
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,197
Can I come in?

256
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:40,436
Yeah!

257
00:13:40,757 --> 00:13:42,714
I didn't know
if you're closed or...

258
00:13:42,995 --> 00:13:44,432
The second time in today.

259
00:13:44,713 --> 00:13:46,549
I'm unforgettable.

260
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,428
Coffee, black?

261
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:49,826
Yup.

262
00:13:50,107 --> 00:13:51,384
Unless you got another color.

263
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:52,984
No, that's it.

264
00:13:53,303 --> 00:13:54,821
Okay, I'll take it.

265
00:13:55,142 --> 00:13:56,698
I was thinkin' about Christmas.

266
00:13:56,979 --> 00:13:58,736
Yeah, they have
it every year.

267
00:13:59,057 --> 00:14:04,091
Yeah, but this year
Makayla is the angel.

268
00:14:04,372 --> 00:14:08,446
Aww, she'll be such a doll.

269
00:14:08,727 --> 00:14:11,523
Anyway...

270
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,675
You ought to come.

271
00:14:18,956 --> 00:14:20,113
Yeah.

272
00:14:20,394 --> 00:14:22,271
I mean, I'll be there.

273
00:14:22,591 --> 00:14:24,508
I know the angel.

274
00:14:24,789 --> 00:14:31,621
So maybe she could magically
make a chair appear next to me.

275
00:14:35,139 --> 00:14:39,253
Yeah, I'll probably come.

276
00:14:39,534 --> 00:14:45,885
Well...Merry Christmas.

277
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:48,443
Merry Christmas to you.

278
00:14:48,723 --> 00:14:50,600
See ya.

279
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:55,795
I don't know.

280
00:14:56,076 --> 00:14:58,992
I just thought the algebra was,
you know, always tricky.

281
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,510
Yeah.

282
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:01,669
Mornin', Mayor.

283
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:03,427
Your son's gettin'
faster every day.

284
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:04,786
That's what I like to hear.

285
00:15:05,065 --> 00:15:06,184
How you doin', Coach?

286
00:15:06,504 --> 00:15:07,702
Good, good.
thanks to you.

287
00:15:09,422 --> 00:15:10,459
I hope this town
keeps re-electing you

288
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,297
as long you'll have us.

289
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,535
Thank you.
I appreciate that.

290
00:15:14,815 --> 00:15:17,452
So, how are plans goin'
for the Christmas Cup race?

291
00:15:17,733 --> 00:15:20,529
We have got a great turnout
and I--are you gonna enter?

292
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:21,967
Yeah, maybe so.

293
00:15:22,248 --> 00:15:24,524
I'm not in my son's age group,
so he can't show me up.

294
00:15:24,805 --> 00:15:25,964
I've been there.

295
00:15:26,244 --> 00:15:28,040
I understand that.
See you later.

296
00:15:28,321 --> 00:15:30,478
Hey, Dad, can we go?

297
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:32,196
I'll be late for school.

298
00:15:32,477 --> 00:15:34,833
Oh, yeah, school, sure.

299
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,588
Dan, got a minute?

300
00:15:43,425 --> 00:15:44,463
Yeah.

301
00:15:44,744 --> 00:15:46,861
I got my mayor's hat
on all day today.

302
00:15:47,142 --> 00:15:48,299
What's up?

303
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,658
Have you already started
the new paint

304
00:15:49,938 --> 00:15:51,415
for the nativity statues?

305
00:15:51,696 --> 00:15:53,892
Mmm, yeah, they
should be ready any time now.

306
00:15:54,213 --> 00:15:56,970
We can put 'em up
this weekend, I think.

307
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,408
Actually, we can't.

308
00:15:58,689 --> 00:16:00,525
A formal complaint has been
filed about the town

309
00:16:00,806 --> 00:16:02,403
Christmas decorations.

310
00:16:02,684 --> 00:16:04,002
A complaint about Christmas?

311
00:16:04,283 --> 00:16:06,000
It says that because the town
is spending money

312
00:16:06,281 --> 00:16:07,518
on Christian imagery
being placed

313
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:09,157
on government property,

314
00:16:09,437 --> 00:16:11,275
we're in violation
of the establishment clause.

315
00:16:11,556 --> 00:16:13,072
The complaint seeks
a preliminary injunction

316
00:16:13,353 --> 00:16:16,508
preventing us from finishing
the display until the judge

317
00:16:16,828 --> 00:16:18,466
rules on the complaint.

318
00:16:18,787 --> 00:16:20,904
Who filed this complaint?
The Grinch?

319
00:16:21,185 --> 00:16:23,102
Mitch Bright.

320
00:16:24,861 --> 00:16:26,218
What's your assessment?

321
00:16:26,539 --> 00:16:27,417
Does he have a case?

322
00:16:27,698 --> 00:16:29,535
Potentially.

323
00:16:31,453 --> 00:16:33,570
These decorations have been
part of the town tradition

324
00:16:33,851 --> 00:16:34,929
for over 50 years.

325
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,686
We've never had
a problem before.
a complaint before.

326
00:16:39,884 --> 00:16:41,162
When's the ruling?

327
00:16:41,442 --> 00:16:42,681
In 20 days.

328
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,396
Unless you want to find
a compromise before then.

329
00:16:46,677 --> 00:16:48,554
No, I don't
want to compromise.

330
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,672
We should bring
before the city council, Dan.

331
00:16:50,993 --> 00:16:52,390
They need to know.

332
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:55,387
Okay, so you're telling me
Mitch Bright comes back here

333
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:58,344
after 20 years, and he's
bringin' his tolerance

334
00:16:58,664 --> 00:16:59,981
and he's bringin'
his open mindedness,

335
00:17:00,262 --> 00:17:01,460
like they do, right?

336
00:17:01,741 --> 00:17:04,296
And the first thing he does is
get a load of our nativity scene

337
00:17:04,617 --> 00:17:06,335
that we've had for 50 years
and he's like, "Oh, gee,

338
00:17:06,616 --> 00:17:07,973
"we got to sue somebody
because, you know,

339
00:17:08,294 --> 00:17:10,091
"what if some child innocently
gets a glimpse

340
00:17:10,412 --> 00:17:11,449
"ofthe baby Jesus?

341
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,847
"And hey, if we get rid of all
these Merry Christmas speakers,

342
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:15,446
"I'll tell you what
we should do next.

343
00:17:15,726 --> 00:17:16,844
"Why stop there?

344
00:17:17,165 --> 00:17:18,921
"Let's go after those,
I don't know, people that say,

345
00:17:19,242 --> 00:17:20,560
"'God bless you'
after you sneeze.

346
00:17:20,841 --> 00:17:21,718
"Why not?

347
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:23,716
"Because what if I'm
an atheist, and it's like, hey,

348
00:17:24,036 --> 00:17:26,153
I want to get sick without
divine intervention, right?"

349
00:17:26,434 --> 00:17:27,872
Well, let me tell you
something brother,

350
00:17:28,152 --> 00:17:29,470
see, 'cause we're Christians.

351
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:31,428
Christians
happen to have started

352
00:17:31,749 --> 00:17:33,386
the United States of America.

353
00:17:33,706 --> 00:17:36,423
And if they think that they're
gonna take this without a fight

354
00:17:36,744 --> 00:17:38,460
with the Reed brothers, they
are wrong and they better

355
00:17:38,781 --> 00:17:42,137
get prepared and they
better put a helmet on,

356
00:17:42,457 --> 00:17:44,734
'cause it's my country too.

357
00:17:45,013 --> 00:17:47,330
Yeah, you took that better
than I thought you would.

358
00:17:47,611 --> 00:17:48,729
Hi, folks!

359
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:51,247
Looks like our 1 o'clock
flight tour's here.

360
00:17:51,527 --> 00:17:52,605
Hey!

361
00:17:52,886 --> 00:17:54,603
Well good to have you!
Harland, they made it!

362
00:17:54,883 --> 00:17:56,162
All right, okay.

363
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:57,560
Hey, jump in!

364
00:17:57,841 --> 00:17:58,719
Harland, set up
'em up, will you,

365
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,517
in the back ifyou don't mind?

366
00:18:00,798 --> 00:18:03,074
How are we gonna
put a stop to this guy?

367
00:18:03,355 --> 00:18:05,952
We're gonna handle this like
we do any other civil suit.

368
00:18:06,232 --> 00:18:08,707
Have a meeting, have
a discussion, take a vote,

369
00:18:09,028 --> 00:18:10,986
like always.

370
00:18:11,265 --> 00:18:12,544
It's gonna be that easy?

371
00:18:12,864 --> 00:18:14,381
Calm and orderly.

372
00:18:14,702 --> 00:18:15,661
Let's go.

373
00:18:15,941 --> 00:18:17,658
The platform
was your idea, Dan.

374
00:18:17,939 --> 00:18:19,177
You got us into this.

375
00:18:19,497 --> 00:18:21,454
We voted unanimously
to spend the money on it.

376
00:18:21,735 --> 00:18:23,132
We voted.

377
00:18:23,453 --> 00:18:24,931
So did we do something
wrong or didn't we?

378
00:18:25,212 --> 00:18:26,849
It's gonna cost a pile
of money to fight this case

379
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:28,367
and come spring,
we're gonna need to fill

380
00:18:28,648 --> 00:18:29,686
a whole bunch of new pot holes.

381
00:18:29,966 --> 00:18:31,483
And we need to spend
more money on snow removal.

382
00:18:31,764 --> 00:18:33,161
We went cheap
on the rock salt this year.

383
00:18:33,442 --> 00:18:34,560
That's true.
I know.

384
00:18:34,841 --> 00:18:36,078
You know, Mitch Bright
has a lot of money,

385
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:37,476
and he could take this
all the way

386
00:18:37,757 --> 00:18:38,636
to the Supreme Court.

387
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:40,633
And that kind of case
could bankrupt the town.

388
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:44,070
Okay, look, can we
back up from the Supreme Court?

389
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,628
Willa has the legal
under control.

390
00:18:45,949 --> 00:18:47,946
It's not gonna cost us anything.

391
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:49,544
It's wastin' her time.

392
00:18:49,865 --> 00:18:51,702
So do we need to take
down the banner outside?
further decoration, so no.

393
00:18:55,179 --> 00:18:56,696
Yeah, no, we're not
taking down the banner.

394
00:18:57,976 --> 00:18:59,213
We could replace
it with something.

395
00:18:59,534 --> 00:19:00,492
It's old anyway.

396
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:03,529
Whoa, so now we just
replace anything that's old?

397
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,685
Look, it's old because it's
a town tradition

398
00:19:08,644 --> 00:19:11,920
I assume you all have enjoyed
all these years as an indication

399
00:19:12,241 --> 00:19:13,438
of Christmas, right?

400
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:16,994
I sold a baby Jesus
out of it once when I was a kid.

401
00:19:17,315 --> 00:19:21,230
Got coal in my stockin'
that year, too, as I recall.

402
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,587
My mother wasn't fond
of practical jokes.

403
00:19:23,908 --> 00:19:26,544
Look, Mitch Bright has
a personal vendetta against me.

404
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:28,622
He has since we were teenagers.

405
00:19:28,943 --> 00:19:30,140
I mean, you all know that.

406
00:19:30,421 --> 00:19:32,139
It's just--he's tryin'
to prove a point.

407
00:19:32,419 --> 00:19:34,775
He wants to irritate me,
and it's childish, all right?

408
00:19:35,056 --> 00:19:37,852
And I'm not--no,
we are not gonna cave in.

409
00:19:38,133 --> 00:19:41,288
If this is personal between
you and him, work it out.

410
00:19:41,609 --> 00:19:42,726
Don't drag
the whole town into it.

411
00:19:43,007 --> 00:19:44,126
Okay fine, that's fair.
I understand.

412
00:19:44,445 --> 00:19:45,564
Mitch Bright actually has
some good ideas

413
00:19:45,845 --> 00:19:46,842
that I really think
have some merits.

414
00:19:47,123 --> 00:19:48,281
Like what kind of good ideas?

415
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,719
Some business ideas, and I
think we should listen to him.

416
00:19:50,999 --> 00:19:52,676
I don't think we should
just push him out.

417
00:19:52,957 --> 00:19:54,794
We were headed for the best
Christmas season yet,

418
00:19:55,115 --> 00:19:57,351
and we don't need some big
hub-bub to quelch

419
00:19:57,632 --> 00:19:58,710
a holiday cheer.

420
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,389
And holiday spending.

421
00:20:00,669 --> 00:20:04,063
Well, you have my word.

422
00:20:04,344 --> 00:20:09,098
I will have a little chat
with Mitch.

423
00:20:14,614 --> 00:20:17,170
Do you wait for me
to come to the trails?

424
00:20:17,451 --> 00:20:18,768
I'm just training.

425
00:20:19,049 --> 00:20:20,206
Same as you.

426
00:20:20,527 --> 00:20:22,245
So, you're dad's not here?

427
00:20:22,565 --> 00:20:24,682
No, he's busy.

428
00:20:26,601 --> 00:20:28,357
Do want to ski together?

429
00:20:28,638 --> 00:20:29,716
You mean race?

430
00:20:29,996 --> 00:20:31,235
If you want.

431
00:20:31,516 --> 00:20:32,793
No, it's what you want
because you have

432
00:20:33,074 --> 00:20:35,230
some weird thing
about wanting to beat me.

433
00:20:35,511 --> 00:20:36,948
You're best skier
on the school's team.

434
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:38,427
Of course
I want to beat you.

435
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,385
That's how I get better.

436
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:42,463
You think I'm the best?

437
00:20:42,744 --> 00:20:44,581
Never mind.

438
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:52,452
There are cruise ships
passing our harbor every day.

439
00:20:52,773 --> 00:20:56,287
All we need to do is come
up with a way to make 'em stop.

440
00:20:56,608 --> 00:20:58,565
We have a glacier
right at our doorstep,

441
00:20:58,846 --> 00:21:01,802
yet there's only one company
that offers excursions.

442
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:05,079
Reed's Alaska Adventures.

443
00:21:05,399 --> 00:21:07,835
Well, good morning, Dan.

444
00:21:08,116 --> 00:21:10,512
We were just talkin' about ways
to bring you more business.

445
00:21:10,793 --> 00:21:12,989
I want to talk to you
about your court filings.

446
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:18,464
Maybe you could drop by my
office when you're done here.

447
00:21:18,745 --> 00:21:20,502
Well actually, Dan,

448
00:21:20,782 --> 00:21:22,299
this is my office,
it's my meeting.

449
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:25,217
So why don't you
pull up a chair?

450
00:21:28,575 --> 00:21:31,491
Do you really care
about city hall decorations?

451
00:21:31,811 --> 00:21:35,325
Or is this about me?

452
00:21:43,399 --> 00:21:46,394
You really think
that highly of yourself?

453
00:21:46,675 --> 00:21:51,748
I don't think you really
have a problem with Christmas.

454
00:21:52,029 --> 00:21:53,826
Oh, you'd be wrong
about that.

455
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:55,265
Really?

456
00:21:55,545 --> 00:21:57,582
Because I do have
a problem with Christmas,

457
00:21:57,862 --> 00:22:02,776
as I do with Jesus and God
and all the rest ofthe garbage

458
00:22:03,096 --> 00:22:04,934
you Christians have been jammin'
down my throat

459
00:22:05,214 --> 00:22:06,492
since I was a kid.

460
00:22:06,813 --> 00:22:08,370
You think you have
all the answers

461
00:22:08,651 --> 00:22:11,687
and all the virtues
of the world, don't you?

462
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:14,683
See, I think you're no
different than anybody else.

463
00:22:14,964 --> 00:22:19,398
As a matter of fact,
you're probably even worse.

464
00:22:19,718 --> 00:22:22,515
You so-called Christians who
are celebrating the birth

465
00:22:22,795 --> 00:22:25,552
of their savior
are the same people cussing me

466
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:28,629
over a parking spot
at the mall.

467
00:22:28,909 --> 00:22:30,307
Why?

468
00:22:30,588 --> 00:22:34,063
Because Jesus is coming,
so we better rush on down

469
00:22:34,383 --> 00:22:36,180
to get ourselves a good deal
on a flat screen TV

470
00:22:36,461 --> 00:22:37,539
before they run out.

471
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,417
That's not Christmas.

472
00:22:39,698 --> 00:22:44,451
Christmas or not, I find that
most of you followers

473
00:22:44,732 --> 00:22:48,087
are the most
unforgiving, unloving,

474
00:22:48,368 --> 00:22:50,844
even bigoted people
I've ever seen.

475
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:52,563
If we're already
done on name calling,

476
00:22:52,883 --> 00:22:54,521
this conversation is over.

477
00:22:54,842 --> 00:22:56,559
No, you know what?

478
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,997
I'm sorry.

479
00:22:58,278 --> 00:23:00,674
All right, I'm sorry that you've
had such bad experiences

480
00:23:00,955 --> 00:23:02,752
with Christians, but that
doesn't mean that you can ruin

481
00:23:03,033 --> 00:23:05,748
Christmas
for everybody else here.

482
00:23:06,029 --> 00:23:07,506
I'm still the mayor.

483
00:23:07,787 --> 00:23:10,103
I'm not gonna let you
hold this town hostage.

484
00:23:10,424 --> 00:23:13,340
And as the mayor,
you are bound to follow

485
00:23:13,621 --> 00:23:15,658
the letter of the law,
my friend.

486
00:23:15,939 --> 00:23:18,176
Trust me,
I'm an expert on this.

487
00:23:18,456 --> 00:23:20,573
You cannot preach
your religion, Dan.

488
00:23:20,854 --> 00:23:22,331
Yeah, but I'm
still a citizen.

489
00:23:22,612 --> 00:23:24,689
And as a citizen, I have a first
amendment right to express

490
00:23:25,009 --> 00:23:26,606
my own beliefs.

491
00:23:26,927 --> 00:23:30,882
But you do not have the right
to spend the taxpayer's money

492
00:23:31,162 --> 00:23:32,520
to propagate them.

493
00:23:32,841 --> 00:23:34,877
The only money I've spent
is to take better care

494
00:23:35,158 --> 00:23:36,475
of town property.

495
00:23:36,796 --> 00:23:39,393
Town property,
which establishes a religion,

496
00:23:39,713 --> 00:23:42,630
which is unconstitutional.

497
00:23:43,709 --> 00:23:46,465
Congress shall pass no law

498
00:23:46,746 --> 00:23:50,420
respecting
the establishment of religion.

499
00:23:50,701 --> 00:23:56,214
Or prohibits
the free exercise thereof.

500
00:23:56,495 --> 00:23:57,532
Bravo.

501
00:23:57,813 --> 00:24:03,127
You don't have a monopoly
on the law or this town.

502
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:05,365
You don't have the right to tell
people how to live

503
00:24:05,645 --> 00:24:07,642
and how to worship.
with me, fine.

504
00:24:12,158 --> 00:24:15,194
You want to run for mayor
of this town, try to change it?

505
00:24:15,474 --> 00:24:17,111
You go ahead and try it.

506
00:24:17,392 --> 00:24:19,669
Is that a dare, Dan?

507
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:21,946
'Cause you sound scared.

508
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:24,504
You're already campaigning.

509
00:24:24,785 --> 00:24:26,142
You don't think it's obvious why
you come down from the hill

510
00:24:26,463 --> 00:24:27,741
in your fancy little shoes

511
00:24:28,022 --> 00:24:29,419
and try to pander
to the common people

512
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,296
who you think might
follow your ideas?

513
00:24:32,577 --> 00:24:34,974
I think you got it all wrong.

514
00:24:35,294 --> 00:24:38,688
I think it's quite apparent
why I'm here every morning.

515
00:24:39,889 --> 00:24:42,245
Free wireless.

516
00:24:42,525 --> 00:24:44,363
You want a fight?

517
00:24:44,644 --> 00:24:47,000
You got one.

518
00:25:05,181 --> 00:25:07,058
Joe!

519
00:25:07,379 --> 00:25:09,136
What are you doin'?

520
00:25:09,456 --> 00:25:11,493
Who told you to do this?

521
00:25:11,774 --> 00:25:14,370
We've got the full support
of the city council, Dan.

522
00:25:14,651 --> 00:25:16,448
Besides, we needed
a new one anyway.

523
00:25:16,729 --> 00:25:18,566
And there's nothin' wrong
with being more inclusive.

524
00:25:18,847 --> 00:25:20,405
Season's greetings?

525
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:21,922
Yeah.

526
00:25:22,203 --> 00:25:23,640
It works for everybody.

527
00:25:28,596 --> 00:25:31,192
Happy winter, Joe.

528
00:25:31,473 --> 00:25:32,910
Merry snow falling day,

529
00:25:33,191 --> 00:25:37,346
but don't put that on a sign,
you might offend somebody.

530
00:26:12,549 --> 00:26:14,785
Hey, what's goin' on?

531
00:26:16,544 --> 00:26:18,821
Nothin', just thinkin'.

532
00:26:19,102 --> 00:26:21,898
Thinkin' about what?

533
00:26:25,136 --> 00:26:27,053
My life.

534
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:33,125
Could I have done more?

535
00:26:33,406 --> 00:26:37,401
Done more about what?

536
00:26:37,681 --> 00:26:43,995
Had a--you know,
a job, a real job.

537
00:26:44,274 --> 00:26:47,590
Honey, you have
two real jobs.

538
00:26:47,911 --> 00:26:50,508
Mitch is getting to you.

539
00:26:50,828 --> 00:26:53,224
Nah, he's just bringing
up some old stuff.

540
00:26:53,505 --> 00:26:56,340
Well, if it means you
would have ended up like him,

541
00:26:56,661 --> 00:27:00,496
then the answer's a big,
fat no on all the above.

542
00:27:00,777 --> 00:27:07,489
Yeah, but would I have ended
up like him if I'd gone out

543
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:10,127
and seen the world?

544
00:27:10,447 --> 00:27:12,604
You mean, would you have
become rich and glamorous?

545
00:27:12,885 --> 00:27:16,039
Ohh, so you think
he's rich and glamorous?

546
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:21,953
He's rich and glamorous
and miserable and alone.

547
00:27:29,347 --> 00:27:32,942
I just wonder if I
would have lost my faith.

548
00:27:33,222 --> 00:27:35,379
Oh, sweetheart.

549
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,817
I don't think you could ever
lose something

550
00:27:38,097 --> 00:27:41,931
that's such an important part
of who you are.

551
00:27:56,637 --> 00:27:58,834
Hey, guys.

552
00:27:59,155 --> 00:28:01,311
Hey.

553
00:28:01,592 --> 00:28:03,228
Hey, coach.

554
00:28:04,948 --> 00:28:06,785
So, what's the genius
up to now?

555
00:28:07,066 --> 00:28:09,382
He says he can bring
in the owner of the cruise line

556
00:28:09,703 --> 00:28:12,260
and make Trapper Falls
a regular excursion stop.

557
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:14,137
What do you think, Mayor?

558
00:28:14,418 --> 00:28:19,492
I think it's all talk until
somebody actually shows up.

559
00:28:19,772 --> 00:28:21,330
It wouldn't hurt your
business though, would it?

560
00:28:21,651 --> 00:28:23,648
We'll see.

561
00:28:25,605 --> 00:28:26,884
Here we go.

562
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:28,322
Thank you, gentlemen.

563
00:28:28,602 --> 00:28:29,480
Thank you.

564
00:28:29,761 --> 00:28:31,239
Happy holidays.

565
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,357
What?
Greg.

566
00:28:33,637 --> 00:28:34,995
Thank you, Josie.

567
00:28:35,315 --> 00:28:38,471
I'm pretty happy.

568
00:28:38,752 --> 00:28:40,149
You are too, aren't you?

569
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:41,508
You happy?

570
00:28:41,788 --> 00:28:42,947
Here we go.

571
00:28:43,228 --> 00:28:44,345
Hey, anybody not happy?

572
00:28:44,626 --> 00:28:45,904
I mean, it's,
"Happy Holidays," right?

573
00:28:46,184 --> 00:28:47,501
Not, "Unhappy Holidays."

574
00:28:47,822 --> 00:28:51,856
But I got to say, there's really
only one holiday that makes me

575
00:28:52,137 --> 00:28:53,654
happy in December.

576
00:28:55,973 --> 00:28:57,171
What could it be?

577
00:28:57,492 --> 00:28:59,808
Any suggestions?

578
00:29:00,089 --> 00:29:01,406
Boxing Day, right?

579
00:29:01,687 --> 00:29:02,924
Make you happy?

580
00:29:03,205 --> 00:29:05,562
Not me 'cause I don't
know what it's for.

581
00:29:05,843 --> 00:29:08,399
Oh, let me see,
we got Pearl Harbor Day.

582
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,796
Doesn't get more
uplifting than, you know,

583
00:29:11,076 --> 00:29:13,793
getting attacked by an enemy
and goin' into war, right?

584
00:29:14,114 --> 00:29:15,431
But that isn't it.

585
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:17,828
I think it's Christmas.
Christmas!

586
00:29:18,149 --> 00:29:21,425
Christmas is the only holiday
in December that makes me

587
00:29:21,706 --> 00:29:26,979
wanna get up and shout
from the rooftops

588
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,778
and celebrate it.

589
00:29:29,057 --> 00:29:30,935
It makes me happy.

590
00:29:31,216 --> 00:29:34,330
I believe in Christmas, and I
especially believe in the one

591
00:29:34,651 --> 00:29:37,807
that Christmas is named after.

592
00:29:38,088 --> 00:29:41,123
So I'm gonna tell you something,
you don't be afraid to say

593
00:29:41,444 --> 00:29:44,880
exactly what you believe 'cause
I know what it is, Josie.

594
00:29:45,161 --> 00:29:47,397
You stand for what you believe.

595
00:29:47,678 --> 00:29:49,435
I think we need to say
exactly what it is,

596
00:29:49,716 --> 00:29:52,512
and so if you're gonna spend
a little time celebratin'

597
00:29:52,793 --> 00:29:56,427
all the holidays, don't forget
the most miraculous,

598
00:29:56,708 --> 00:29:59,144
holy day there ever was.

599
00:29:59,425 --> 00:30:01,741
So here's to you,
Trapper Falls.

600
00:30:02,062 --> 00:30:03,220
I got a special gift.

601
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:07,455
Listen, Merry Christmas.

602
00:30:07,776 --> 00:30:11,651
Merry Christmas, Mitch.

603
00:30:11,931 --> 00:30:16,446
Sound familiar?

604
00:30:16,766 --> 00:30:20,281
Ahh, hat felt good.

605
00:30:23,719 --> 00:30:25,636
We wonder why
you're not married.
What?

606
00:30:26,915 --> 00:30:29,072
You're a heck of a catch.

607
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:35,865
One, two.

608
00:30:36,185 --> 00:30:37,983
One, two!

609
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:02,436
I'm okay.
Keep going.

610
00:31:02,717 --> 00:31:03,596
It's your best time ever.

611
00:31:03,876 --> 00:31:05,353
You're hurt.
I am not.

612
00:31:05,633 --> 00:31:08,150
Ski then.

613
00:31:21,697 --> 00:31:24,613
Hey, Monica, I'm lookin'
for that form--

614
00:31:26,132 --> 00:31:28,407
Hey, Mitch.

615
00:31:28,728 --> 00:31:31,045
What could we do
for you today?

616
00:31:31,326 --> 00:31:32,364
I'm good.

617
00:31:32,685 --> 00:31:37,319
Just brushing up on my
Trapper Falls election process.

618
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:41,394
Decided to officially throw
my hat in the ring today.

619
00:31:41,675 --> 00:31:43,672
Oh, by the way, tell your
brother I said thanks a lot

620
00:31:43,953 --> 00:31:46,509
for the outburst out at
the coffee shop this morning.

621
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:49,467
Got me a ton of signatures
on my petition.

622
00:31:49,747 --> 00:31:51,423
So...

623
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:57,537
So if there isn't anything else,
I'm gonna wrangle up some more

624
00:31:57,817 --> 00:32:02,252
signatures and pick up some
more campaign buttons.

625
00:32:02,533 --> 00:32:06,368
That Mary,
she's a cutie, isn't she?

626
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,396
So, do you think he's got
enough supporters to win?

627
00:32:16,717 --> 00:32:19,793
I heard he's got
two million signatures.

628
00:32:20,074 --> 00:32:22,630
There are only
4,000 people in town.

629
00:32:24,389 --> 00:32:26,706
So do you think he
really wants to be mayor?

630
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:28,384
You know, it's possible
that he's trying to divide

631
00:32:28,665 --> 00:32:31,021
the whole town
over this Christmas thing

632
00:32:31,342 --> 00:32:33,898
just to see who's with me.

633
00:32:34,219 --> 00:32:35,576
What are you going to do?

634
00:32:35,857 --> 00:32:37,374
Come here.

635
00:32:37,654 --> 00:32:39,732
I'm gonna do what I always do

636
00:32:40,052 --> 00:32:42,448
and what I think
you should do too.

637
00:32:42,729 --> 00:32:47,083
And that is stand by
what I believe in, okay?

638
00:32:47,364 --> 00:32:48,562
'Kay.

639
00:32:49,602 --> 00:32:51,440
Glory to God in the highest.

640
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,317
On earth, peace
and good will to men.

641
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:54,756
Glory to God in the highest.

642
00:32:55,036 --> 00:32:57,313
On earth, peace
and good will to men.

643
00:32:57,634 --> 00:33:01,507
Hark, the herald angels sing,

644
00:33:01,788 --> 00:33:05,504
glory to the newborn king.

645
00:33:05,785 --> 00:33:10,099
Peace on earth and mercy mild--

646
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,617
Hey kid, how are you, honey?

647
00:33:12,897 --> 00:33:14,135
Is your daddy here tonight?

648
00:33:14,416 --> 00:33:15,374
My Uncle Greg is with me.

649
00:33:15,655 --> 00:33:18,450
Oh, your Uncle Greg should
know that you're in breach

650
00:33:18,731 --> 00:33:20,728
of the preliminary injunction.

651
00:33:21,048 --> 00:33:24,084
You can't have a religious
display on this site.

652
00:33:24,364 --> 00:33:26,281
Are you saying
I can't stay here and sing?

653
00:33:26,562 --> 00:33:27,481
I'm sorry, sweetie.

654
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,358
No, you can't.

655
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:30,916
This is government property.

656
00:33:31,197 --> 00:33:33,234
But I'm not
government property.

657
00:33:33,515 --> 00:33:35,112
That's right.

658
00:33:35,393 --> 00:33:40,906
No, no, you're not, honey,
but you need to come down now.

659
00:33:41,187 --> 00:33:42,504
Yeah, she can't do this.
You know that.

660
00:33:42,785 --> 00:33:43,903
She has to come down.

661
00:33:44,184 --> 00:33:45,341
You know, Mitch,
as far as I know,

662
00:33:45,621 --> 00:33:47,338
she's allowed to stand there
and sing anything she wants to.

663
00:33:47,619 --> 00:33:49,097
And if she wants to do
it dressed like an angel,

664
00:33:49,417 --> 00:33:51,135
there's really not a heck
of a lot of you can do about it.

665
00:33:51,416 --> 00:33:53,133
I don't know how you missed
this one in lawyer school,

666
00:33:53,414 --> 00:33:54,851
but what I understand,
the first amendment

667
00:33:55,172 --> 00:33:56,729
applies to Christians too.

668
00:33:57,049 --> 00:33:59,486
Yeah, honey,
come down now.
Hey,
I'm serious.

669
00:33:59,767 --> 00:34:01,484
Hey, honey,
please come down.

670
00:34:01,765 --> 00:34:03,163
Get your hands off me!

671
00:34:03,443 --> 00:34:05,720
Hey, back off!

672
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,398
Now you all saw that.

673
00:34:07,718 --> 00:34:08,635
That was assault.

674
00:34:08,956 --> 00:34:10,314
Are you serious?

675
00:34:10,595 --> 00:34:13,111
Buddy, you're a bigger wuss now
than you were in high school.

676
00:34:13,391 --> 00:34:15,109
Thank you.

677
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:21,622
Hark, the herald angels sing,
Glory to--

678
00:34:21,903 --> 00:34:24,420
Hello?
Yeah, this is Mitch Bright.

679
00:34:25,579 --> 00:34:27,736
Greg,
what were you thinking?

680
00:34:28,016 --> 00:34:29,415
It was my idea, Mom.

681
00:34:29,695 --> 00:34:31,331
Yes, I just drove
the getaway car.

682
00:34:31,612 --> 00:34:33,089
Apparently not fast enough.

683
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:34,607
Dan!
stand up for what we believe in.

684
00:34:38,325 --> 00:34:39,602
I know, I was just
hoping that maybe

685
00:34:39,923 --> 00:34:41,401
you'd make it to 1 7 or 1 8

686
00:34:41,681 --> 00:34:43,999
before I got a call
from the police.

687
00:34:44,279 --> 00:34:46,435
You know, I can tolerate
snarky bumper stickers

688
00:34:46,756 --> 00:34:48,514
and letters to the editor,
but the fact is Mitch Bright

689
00:34:48,834 --> 00:34:50,272
called the cops on a child.

690
00:34:50,553 --> 00:34:52,509
We're lucky they
let this thing drop.

691
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:55,905
They could've pressed
for them to arrest Greg.

692
00:34:56,185 --> 00:34:58,342
This fight has gone far enough.

693
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:00,739
We need a solution.

694
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:03,537
I'll call Willa, see if we
can't get some folks together

695
00:35:03,818 --> 00:35:05,096
to talk about it.

696
00:35:05,417 --> 00:35:06,614
Well, count me in.
I don't think so.

697
00:35:08,293 --> 00:35:10,211
You and Gabriel
here are grounded.

698
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:12,488
You can't ground me.

699
00:35:13,608 --> 00:35:16,523
I'll go in your place
to make sure nobodyjumps

700
00:35:16,804 --> 00:35:20,958
up on any chairs
or causes a disturbance.

701
00:35:32,947 --> 00:35:36,741
Well, in cases
similar to ours,

702
00:35:37,022 --> 00:35:40,657
the rulings have gone to
the plaintiff when the nativity

703
00:35:40,938 --> 00:35:43,853
is the only element
of the display.

704
00:35:44,134 --> 00:35:45,772
But what are
we supposed to do?

705
00:35:46,053 --> 00:35:47,530
I mean, are we supposed
to put up--you know,

706
00:35:47,811 --> 00:35:50,367
we put up a menorah and then
we put up the kwanza.

707
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:52,205
I don't even know
what that symbol is.

708
00:35:52,486 --> 00:35:54,123
I mean, where does it end?

709
00:35:54,404 --> 00:35:56,041
The point is the person
bringing the complaint

710
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:57,760
hates all religion.

711
00:35:58,079 --> 00:35:59,398
He hates God.

712
00:35:59,678 --> 00:36:01,954
He doesn't want equal
representation of religion;

713
00:36:02,235 --> 00:36:03,592
he wants none.
down to these God haters?

714
00:36:09,547 --> 00:36:12,383
I mean, is this what
we teach our children?

715
00:36:12,703 --> 00:36:14,062
At the first sign of a threat,

716
00:36:14,342 --> 00:36:16,419
then we cave on our traditions
and beliefs?

717
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:20,015
In this case, our tradition
is technically in violation

718
00:36:20,296 --> 00:36:22,093
of the establishment clause.

719
00:36:22,413 --> 00:36:24,969
Screw
the establishment clause.

720
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:26,368
Yes, I'm sorry, she's right.

721
00:36:26,649 --> 00:36:28,046
There's where we want
to teach our children.

722
00:36:28,367 --> 00:36:30,723
Disrespect for our
country and authority?

723
00:36:31,004 --> 00:36:32,481
So what do you think
we should do about this,

724
00:36:32,762 --> 00:36:34,799
'cause this is an injustice.

725
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,476
What is justice?

726
00:36:37,757 --> 00:36:39,674
We gain back
our Christmas decorations

727
00:36:39,995 --> 00:36:42,431
at the cost of our souls?

728
00:36:42,712 --> 00:36:45,508
Reverend Tiller,
what are you thinkin'?

729
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:47,626
The nativity's
become too important.

730
00:36:47,946 --> 00:36:52,340
Lovely as they are,
they're statues made ofwood.

731
00:36:52,661 --> 00:36:56,376
And we best not
make them idols.

732
00:36:57,576 --> 00:36:59,493
Oh, good, you're
not doing anything.

733
00:36:59,774 --> 00:37:01,251
Yes, I am.

734
00:37:01,571 --> 00:37:02,489
Uncle Greg's
helping me rehearse

735
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:03,888
for the Christmas program.

736
00:37:04,169 --> 00:37:05,326
You can be the audience.

737
00:37:05,607 --> 00:37:07,045
And if I'm not mistaken,
you're supposed to be

738
00:37:07,365 --> 00:37:10,041
at cross country which is why
I got trapped babysitting.

739
00:37:10,362 --> 00:37:11,479
I'm not a baby.

740
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,035
Well, you're my baby.
You're my baby.

741
00:37:15,516 --> 00:37:19,311
It's a practice run
for the Christmas Cup, so...

742
00:37:19,911 --> 00:37:21,189
I'm not entering.

743
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:22,388
What?

744
00:37:22,669 --> 00:37:23,867
No one's gonna miss me.

745
00:37:26,065 --> 00:37:27,183
Does your dad
know about this?

746
00:37:27,464 --> 00:37:29,820
Dad's too worried about
the people trying to rename it

747
00:37:30,101 --> 00:37:32,857
the Holiday Cup to even notice.

748
00:37:36,853 --> 00:37:40,009
Hi, is Cody here?

749
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:42,047
Cody!

750
00:37:42,368 --> 00:37:44,844
It's a girl.

751
00:37:51,398 --> 00:37:55,433
How come you're
not at practice?

752
00:37:55,713 --> 00:37:57,190
I'm not entering the Cup.

753
00:37:57,470 --> 00:37:58,469
Why not?

754
00:37:58,749 --> 00:38:00,386
Hey, don't let all
the heat out, boy.

755
00:38:00,667 --> 00:38:01,906
Invite her in!

756
00:38:02,185 --> 00:38:03,863
Maybe she doesn't
want to come in.

757
00:38:04,144 --> 00:38:05,621
I'll come in.

758
00:38:05,942 --> 00:38:08,499
Hey!

759
00:38:09,658 --> 00:38:11,136
Hi, I'm Makayla.

760
00:38:11,417 --> 00:38:13,573
Tonight, I'm playing
the part of the angel.

761
00:38:13,854 --> 00:38:16,331
Sienna, playing Sienna.

762
00:38:16,651 --> 00:38:17,849
Our audience just doubled.

763
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:19,966
Come sit down,
we're doing a show.

764
00:38:20,246 --> 00:38:21,404
No!

765
00:38:21,684 --> 00:38:23,163
Kayla, she doesn't want
to stay for the show.

766
00:38:23,483 --> 00:38:24,721
Did you ask her?

767
00:38:25,641 --> 00:38:26,958
It's the same,
boring old program

768
00:38:27,279 --> 00:38:29,516
we go to over and over
every year.

769
00:38:29,796 --> 00:38:32,353
I'm sorry, did you say,

770
00:38:32,634 --> 00:38:36,149
"The same boring,
old program"?

771
00:38:39,586 --> 00:38:46,417
I am offended that you
could ever believe to find

772
00:38:46,738 --> 00:38:51,612
performers like Makayla
and myself could ever deliver

773
00:38:56,008 --> 00:38:58,885
You're gonna change
the story, then?

774
00:38:59,166 --> 00:39:00,443
I don't have to change
the story.

775
00:39:00,724 --> 00:39:01,841
Don't you get it?

776
00:39:02,122 --> 00:39:04,838
The Christmas story is
the greatest story of all time.

777
00:39:05,118 --> 00:39:08,474
The Christmas story is
none like any other.

778
00:39:08,755 --> 00:39:11,111
It's got it all.
It's got intrigue.

779
00:39:11,391 --> 00:39:13,389
It's got scandal.
It's got surprise.

780
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:16,305
So I'll tell you
what, Mr. know-it-all,

781
00:39:16,586 --> 00:39:19,262
why don't you two sit there,
hang on to your long johns,

782
00:39:19,543 --> 00:39:24,377
and observe the masters at work.

783
00:39:25,417 --> 00:39:27,773
Me, me, me,
me, me, me, me.

784
00:39:28,054 --> 00:39:29,451
You, you, you, you, you.

785
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:33,287
Okay, action.

786
00:39:33,607 --> 00:39:37,802
In a world where there was no
television or Xbox or texting,

787
00:39:38,083 --> 00:39:41,958
one girl is about to experience
the greatest challenge

788
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:43,396
of her life.

789
00:39:43,677 --> 00:39:46,434
Look at me, I'm just a girl
trying not to step anywhere

790
00:39:46,714 --> 00:39:47,992
onto scorpions 'cause I
have no socks to--

791
00:39:48,312 --> 00:39:49,471
Do not be afraid.

792
00:39:52,107 --> 00:39:53,785
You have found favor
with God.

793
00:39:54,106 --> 00:39:56,223
You will give birth to a child
and call his name Jesus.

794
00:39:56,503 --> 00:39:57,381
Is that right?

795
00:39:57,662 --> 00:39:59,060
Well, what in the world
would she say?

796
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:01,337
Um, actually, I'm not really
good with this because

797
00:40:01,617 --> 00:40:04,813
you see, I'm suddenly, like,
pregnant without explanation,

798
00:40:05,094 --> 00:40:07,531
which means my fiance can try
to, like, officially stone me,

799
00:40:07,851 --> 00:40:09,448
which completely
ruins my makeup.

800
00:40:09,769 --> 00:40:12,206
And my BFFs will, like,
never speak to me again.

801
00:40:12,487 --> 00:40:15,002
So I really don't see
that as God's favorite.

802
00:40:16,841 --> 00:40:18,119
She didn't say that.

803
00:40:18,439 --> 00:40:19,997
No, that's what everybody
today would have said.

804
00:40:20,278 --> 00:40:22,435
What she actually said was,

805
00:40:22,715 --> 00:40:26,830
"Let it be done to me
as thou hath said,"

806
00:40:27,111 --> 00:40:30,546
because it's really always
spoke with an English accent.

807
00:40:30,826 --> 00:40:33,303
Of course, if she did say
that, it was a little,

808
00:40:33,584 --> 00:40:39,136
little bit more like,
"Go ahead.

809
00:40:39,417 --> 00:40:41,294
Make my baby."

810
00:40:43,093 --> 00:40:44,331
You don't have to stay.

811
00:40:44,611 --> 00:40:46,329
I'm good.

812
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:47,767
Act two.

813
00:40:48,048 --> 00:40:49,245
Matter of fact,
we're missin' somebody.

814
00:40:49,526 --> 00:40:52,362
I know, Joseph.

815
00:40:54,001 --> 00:40:55,879
Stand right here, perfectly.

816
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,797
Try to look handsome for once.

817
00:40:59,196 --> 00:41:01,751
Anna, forgive me
for looking at this so simply.

818
00:41:02,032 --> 00:41:03,829
I teach elementary
kids after all,

819
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:08,384
but Christmas starts
with a capital "C."

820
00:41:08,665 --> 00:41:11,661
The "C" comes
from a name, Christ.

821
00:41:11,942 --> 00:41:15,098
Christ the Lord is the center
of Christmas, not our rights,

822
00:41:15,379 --> 00:41:16,297
not our tradition.

823
00:41:16,577 --> 00:41:19,733
None of that matters if it
starts to detract us

824
00:41:20,054 --> 00:41:23,728
from the one whose birth
we celebrate, right?

825
00:41:24,049 --> 00:41:25,446
Right.

826
00:41:25,767 --> 00:41:28,043
And forgive me, Dan, but I
don't think this is something

827
00:41:28,324 --> 00:41:30,921
city hall can do.

828
00:41:31,201 --> 00:41:33,558
But it is something
that we as Christians can do,

829
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:36,075
something we have to do.

830
00:41:36,356 --> 00:41:40,271
If we spent less time worrying
about our rights and more time

831
00:41:40,592 --> 00:41:42,349
worrying about others' needs,

832
00:41:42,629 --> 00:41:48,222
then I think we might
actually be doing Christmas.

833
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:53,137
And once they arrive,
what happens?

834
00:41:53,418 --> 00:41:55,015
They meet up with crazy people.

835
00:41:55,296 --> 00:41:57,372
Joe, what do you twos want?

836
00:41:57,653 --> 00:41:59,530
Well, like the hundreds
of other people here,

837
00:41:59,811 --> 00:42:01,448
we want a room.

838
00:42:01,729 --> 00:42:06,323
Please, I'm having
a baby right now!

839
00:42:06,604 --> 00:42:08,160
Yeah, like I
haven't heard that.

840
00:42:08,441 --> 00:42:11,877
I'll tell you what, you
twos can go into the barn.

841
00:42:12,157 --> 00:42:13,674
And they do.

842
00:42:13,955 --> 00:42:19,309
Mary is rushed
off to have her baby,

843
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:21,906
but she does it offstage
since it's kind of icky.

844
00:42:22,187 --> 00:42:25,342
And she possibly did it alone
because it would've made Joseph

845
00:42:25,623 --> 00:42:30,217
ceremonially unclean, which
makes Mary not only a saint,

846
00:42:30,498 --> 00:42:34,252
but he's kind of reachin'
action figure status in my book.

847
00:42:34,533 --> 00:42:35,691
Come here.

848
00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:39,447
Cynical audience is
getting out of hand.

849
00:42:39,727 --> 00:42:41,444
Let's show 'em.
Come on.

850
00:42:45,642 --> 00:42:52,554
Look, God of the universe
decides to enter our domain

851
00:42:52,834 --> 00:42:56,348
in the most fragile form.

852
00:42:56,669 --> 00:42:57,827
Can I have him?

853
00:42:58,108 --> 00:42:59,425
There's the baby.

854
00:42:59,706 --> 00:43:00,664
Aww.

855
00:43:00,945 --> 00:43:03,061
That a human can take.

856
00:43:03,382 --> 00:43:05,459
Wow.

857
00:43:07,538 --> 00:43:11,733
Here, I'm gonna let you
be Mary for a little bit.

858
00:43:12,014 --> 00:43:15,049
When God, the Father, sent
his Son to redeem the earth

859
00:43:15,330 --> 00:43:16,487
it was a gift.

860
00:43:16,768 --> 00:43:18,805
Some people welcomed it
with great joy,

861
00:43:19,125 --> 00:43:20,762
others spit upon it.

862
00:43:21,083 --> 00:43:25,438
Two thousand years later,
nothing has changed.

863
00:43:25,758 --> 00:43:30,552
We give the gift with love,
with humility, and with grace.
to that gift is not our concern.

864
00:43:34,429 --> 00:43:38,145
How we respond
to the people is God's concern.

865
00:43:38,466 --> 00:43:40,581
Are we supposed
to just let people like Mitch

866
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,855
No, we're not saying
we roll over.

867
00:43:46,136 --> 00:43:50,331
We just prove him wrong
by action, not argument.

868
00:43:50,612 --> 00:43:53,327
I don't know what that means.

869
00:43:53,608 --> 00:43:55,485
I don't either.

870
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:59,282
However, what does this
Christmas with a capital 'C'

871
00:43:59,563 --> 00:44:01,040
look like?

872
00:44:01,321 --> 00:44:03,396
Like Philippians 2.

873
00:44:03,677 --> 00:44:06,274
Jesus did not consider equality
with God

874
00:44:06,554 --> 00:44:08,311
something that could be grasped.

875
00:44:08,592 --> 00:44:10,549
He made himself nothing.
on the very nature of a servant.

876
00:44:16,664 --> 00:44:19,419
Hmm.

877
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:23,296
The people expected
a political Messiah.

878
00:44:25,055 --> 00:44:27,291
Bet they didn't have
popcorn back then.

879
00:44:27,571 --> 00:44:29,408
But what did they get?

880
00:44:29,689 --> 00:44:35,083
God, instead of coming
down--shh, angels don't laugh.

881
00:44:35,364 --> 00:44:41,556
Instead of God coming
down miraculously...
he humbled himself

882
00:44:46,232 --> 00:44:52,544
and he became God with us.

883
00:44:53,664 --> 00:44:58,577
And he began to heal humanity
by loving them

884
00:45:04,453 --> 00:45:05,770
The end.

885
00:45:06,051 --> 00:45:07,368
Take your bow, son.

886
00:45:07,649 --> 00:45:12,082
And so, Makayla,
playing the angel.

887
00:45:12,363 --> 00:45:14,840
Joseph,
pathetically playing Joseph,

888
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,957
and me as the donkey.

889
00:45:17,238 --> 00:45:18,436
Thank you.

890
00:45:18,717 --> 00:45:19,954
Take your bows.
Take your bows.

891
00:45:20,235 --> 00:45:21,512
You were wonderful, angel.

892
00:45:21,833 --> 00:45:24,390
And you were wonderful--no.

893
00:45:31,503 --> 00:45:34,299
So how's your knee?

894
00:45:34,619 --> 00:45:36,256
It's okay.

895
00:45:36,577 --> 00:45:39,374
You have to swear you
won't tell anybody about this,

896
00:45:39,654 --> 00:45:41,651
you know, at school.

897
00:45:41,932 --> 00:45:43,569
What?
The play?

898
00:45:44,849 --> 00:45:46,766
I'm serious.

899
00:45:48,365 --> 00:45:49,763
I'll make you a deal.

900
00:45:50,043 --> 00:45:53,119
I don't tell anyone at school,
you race the Christmas Cup.

901
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,557
It's a deal.

902
00:45:59,073 --> 00:46:01,630
Sienna.

903
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:03,468
Is that why
you came out here?

904
00:46:03,789 --> 00:46:05,346
Make me race?

905
00:46:05,626 --> 00:46:10,381
No, I came to see
the Christmas show.

906
00:46:13,619 --> 00:46:15,216
Up a bit.

907
00:46:15,536 --> 00:46:17,053
I got to go down.

908
00:46:17,334 --> 00:46:19,051
Isaac, you're on.

909
00:46:19,372 --> 00:46:22,447
Can you get this?

910
00:46:23,686 --> 00:46:26,123
It looks so good,
you guys, I love it!

911
00:46:26,444 --> 00:46:28,042
All right!

912
00:46:34,476 --> 00:46:37,472
I guess anybody can hang
a banner these days.

913
00:46:42,506 --> 00:46:44,982
Merry Christmas.

914
00:46:47,741 --> 00:46:49,937
Who wants to buy an angel
for a kid whose parents

915
00:46:50,218 --> 00:46:52,615
are in prison?

916
00:46:58,530 --> 00:47:00,887
All right, that's good.

917
00:47:02,566 --> 00:47:05,082
Missed a spot.

918
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,318
No, I didn't.

919
00:47:08,599 --> 00:47:09,716
Yeah, you did.

920
00:47:09,997 --> 00:47:11,634
Did I?

921
00:47:14,472 --> 00:47:15,870
Hot chocolate!

922
00:47:16,190 --> 00:47:18,587
Complementary hot chocolate
with a capital 'C.'

923
00:47:18,908 --> 00:47:20,386
I could give you
a shot of whipped cream.

924
00:47:20,667 --> 00:47:23,462
I don't know
about that.

925
00:47:25,581 --> 00:47:26,739
Hi, Josie.

926
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:28,736
Hi.

927
00:47:29,016 --> 00:47:30,773
Oh, last time I was in here,
I kind of accidently

928
00:47:31,054 --> 00:47:33,211
stepped on your chair
with my muddy boots

929
00:47:33,532 --> 00:47:34,850
and made a big scene.

930
00:47:35,130 --> 00:47:36,568
I remember.

931
00:47:36,849 --> 00:47:38,685
Sorry.

932
00:47:40,564 --> 00:47:43,481
Came here
to make it up to you.

933
00:47:52,071 --> 00:47:55,227
I'm good.

934
00:48:02,501 --> 00:48:04,258
You were way faster
the day we raced.

935
00:48:04,539 --> 00:48:06,735
The deal is that
I enter the Cup.

936
00:48:07,016 --> 00:48:08,813
I don't have to win it.

937
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:10,931
With that attitude
you won't.

938
00:48:11,212 --> 00:48:13,408
Thanks, Coach.

939
00:48:17,963 --> 00:48:20,281
Whoa, whoa.

940
00:48:20,601 --> 00:48:22,039
Wow, looks like you
could use some help.

941
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:23,437
What you doin'?

942
00:48:23,718 --> 00:48:25,116
I have a really good idea.

943
00:48:25,436 --> 00:48:26,314
I want to make cookies

944
00:48:26,595 --> 00:48:28,312
for the Christmas
with a capital 'C' mission.

945
00:48:28,593 --> 00:48:30,310
Ah, that is a great idea.

946
00:48:30,591 --> 00:48:32,388
How about if I help you?

947
00:48:32,668 --> 00:48:33,587
There we go.

948
00:48:33,868 --> 00:48:35,425
I'll need your
help to deliver them.

949
00:48:35,706 --> 00:48:36,584
Can you drive me?

950
00:48:36,864 --> 00:48:38,021
Yeah, sure.

951
00:48:38,302 --> 00:48:39,420
Who are they for?

952
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:41,738
Mitch Bright.

953
00:48:43,617 --> 00:48:45,094
Everybody's been doing
nice things

954
00:48:45,375 --> 00:48:47,172
for everybody all over town,

955
00:48:47,452 --> 00:48:51,807
but nobody's done anything
for him as far as I can tell.

956
00:48:52,088 --> 00:48:54,564
Well, maybe they just figure
he really doesn't need

957
00:48:54,845 --> 00:48:57,281
any help or want it.

958
00:48:57,602 --> 00:49:01,356
But everybody wants cookies.

959
00:49:09,429 --> 00:49:10,387
Come on, Mom!

960
00:49:10,667 --> 00:49:12,065
Why are you waiting?

961
00:49:12,346 --> 00:49:13,264
You go on ahead, angel.

962
00:49:13,544 --> 00:49:15,381
I'll just wait
for you here, okay?

963
00:49:32,364 --> 00:49:35,280
I guess he's not home.

964
00:49:38,438 --> 00:49:40,355
Makayla.

965
00:49:59,575 --> 00:50:02,132
Hey, the important thing
is that you did it, right?

966
00:50:02,413 --> 00:50:06,087
He was supposed to know
he's a blessing from heaven.

967
00:50:06,368 --> 00:50:07,366
Do you think he'll get it?

968
00:50:07,687 --> 00:50:09,163
Sure, honey.

969
00:50:09,444 --> 00:50:15,237
Hey, he'll take one bite
and of course he'll know, okay?

970
00:50:33,618 --> 00:50:36,095
I know.

971
00:50:36,376 --> 00:50:37,933
Where have you been?

972
00:50:38,214 --> 00:50:41,289
Honestly, I have been
trying to call you forever.

973
00:50:41,570 --> 00:50:43,606
Oh, we just went
out on a little mission, huh?

974
00:50:43,927 --> 00:50:45,365
Everything okay?

975
00:50:45,646 --> 00:50:49,001
The judge is comin' tomorrow.

976
00:50:49,282 --> 00:50:50,839
Is that good or bad?

977
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:52,558
I don't know.

978
00:50:52,839 --> 00:50:55,673
By the way, good.

979
00:50:55,954 --> 00:50:58,430
Ah, told ya.

980
00:51:05,544 --> 00:51:08,300
How many Christmas cookies
did you have tonight?

981
00:51:08,581 --> 00:51:10,338
Only about seven.

982
00:51:10,619 --> 00:51:13,335
All right, let's
get you in bed, kiddo.

983
00:51:13,616 --> 00:51:16,092
Come on.

984
00:51:16,373 --> 00:51:19,328
That's it.
That's it.

985
00:51:21,247 --> 00:51:22,604
What?

986
00:51:22,925 --> 00:51:26,880
Mitch, he would never win.

987
00:51:27,161 --> 00:51:28,399
Why do you say that?

988
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:31,276
Because he makes
people grumpy.

989
00:51:31,596 --> 00:51:37,469
I think he makes people
because he's grumpy.

990
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:40,066
Why though?

991
00:51:40,387 --> 00:51:42,183
I don't know why.

992
00:51:42,504 --> 00:51:46,099
That's a good question.

993
00:51:48,538 --> 00:51:49,696
Let's pray, okay?

994
00:51:49,977 --> 00:51:51,494
I guess we
should pray for him.

995
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:53,332
Right.

996
00:51:53,612 --> 00:51:54,771
Why don't you start?

997
00:51:55,092 --> 00:51:58,007
Okay.

998
00:51:58,288 --> 00:52:01,284
Dear Lord,
thank you for this day.

999
00:52:01,565 --> 00:52:04,400
Please be with Mitch
and make him nice.

1000
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:07,276
And let Daddy stay as Mayor.

1001
00:52:07,557 --> 00:52:10,233
In Jesus' name, amen.

1002
00:52:10,514 --> 00:52:12,591
Amen.

1003
00:52:12,872 --> 00:52:14,549
All right.

1004
00:52:16,628 --> 00:52:17,586
Night.

1005
00:52:17,867 --> 00:52:19,703
Night, I love you.

1006
00:52:20,744 --> 00:52:24,898
Perhaps you all can show
me what will be placed here.

1007
00:52:25,219 --> 00:52:29,133
Well, there they are.

1008
00:52:29,414 --> 00:52:31,850
Can you bring
them out a little?

1009
00:52:32,171 --> 00:52:33,608
Yeah, sure.

1010
00:52:35,008 --> 00:52:37,644
Okay.

1011
00:52:40,003 --> 00:52:42,480
There she is.

1012
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:45,356
They're beautiful.

1013
00:52:45,637 --> 00:52:46,595
Someone made these?

1014
00:52:46,916 --> 00:52:48,912
Over 50 years ago.

1015
00:52:49,192 --> 00:52:52,109
They were carved by a man
who worked in a lumber mill

1016
00:52:52,389 --> 00:52:54,546
and donated to the town.

1017
00:52:54,827 --> 00:52:57,144
Are there any other
elements to the display?

1018
00:52:57,463 --> 00:52:58,662
Oh, yeah.

1019
00:52:58,942 --> 00:53:02,217
Some animals, a couple
sheep, and a donkey.

1020
00:53:02,538 --> 00:53:04,655
Well, let's have
a talk, shall we?

1021
00:53:07,053 --> 00:53:09,370
I assume you've studied
the case law related

1022
00:53:09,651 --> 00:53:11,966
to the establishment clause?

1023
00:53:12,287 --> 00:53:14,004
We have.

1024
00:53:14,285 --> 00:53:18,041
She's been all over it
with a fine-toothed comb.

1025
00:53:18,322 --> 00:53:22,316
Well, on the record, I have
to tell you that if the creche

1026
00:53:22,597 --> 00:53:25,353
is the only element
of the holiday display

1027
00:53:25,634 --> 00:53:27,951
and it is owned
by the local government

1028
00:53:28,232 --> 00:53:30,468
and displayed
on government property--

1029
00:53:30,788 --> 00:53:33,744
Then you must
rule against it.

1030
00:53:34,024 --> 00:53:36,141
Yes.

1031
00:53:36,461 --> 00:53:39,258
Off the record, I'll tell you
that I don't personally

1032
00:53:39,579 --> 00:53:42,415
want to make a ruling
against Jesus and Mary,

1033
00:53:42,695 --> 00:53:45,291
especially at Christmastime.

1034
00:53:45,572 --> 00:53:47,330
Thank God.

1035
00:53:48,129 --> 00:53:51,205
So, what are you saying?

1036
00:53:51,486 --> 00:53:55,241
Well, there are
three options to consider.

1037
00:53:55,522 --> 00:53:59,037
I mean, you could add to this
as a holiday display and include

1038
00:53:59,316 --> 00:54:01,713
elements of a nonreligious
nature or elements

1039
00:54:02,034 --> 00:54:04,590
that are of other faiths.

1040
00:54:04,911 --> 00:54:08,227
Or the city can donate
or sell them,

1041
00:54:08,508 --> 00:54:12,103
the statues and the platform,
to a private individual

1042
00:54:12,383 --> 00:54:14,540
who can display them
in another place,

1043
00:54:14,821 --> 00:54:17,058
either on private property

1044
00:54:17,378 --> 00:54:19,455
or with permission
in a public setting

1045
00:54:19,735 --> 00:54:21,412
where there is
equal opportunity for others

1046
00:54:21,693 --> 00:54:23,570
to put up their own
holiday displays.

1047
00:54:23,850 --> 00:54:25,289
And the third?

1048
00:54:25,568 --> 00:54:27,007
Don't display them at all.

1049
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:30,204
But if you ask me,
that would be a shame.

1050
00:54:30,483 --> 00:54:32,361
With all due respect,
your Honor,

1051
00:54:32,642 --> 00:54:34,599
all three of those are ruining
our town's traditions

1052
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,757
that we've had over 50 years.

1053
00:54:37,077 --> 00:54:40,113
Or you could look at it
as creating a new tradition.

1054
00:54:40,393 --> 00:54:44,508
I mean, moving the Christ child
to another place of honor

1055
00:54:49,823 --> 00:54:53,418
Perhaps you are more
concerned about yours.

1056
00:54:53,739 --> 00:54:55,856
And this is
my advice on the case,

1057
00:54:56,137 --> 00:54:58,533
if you want to push
for an official ruling,
will have to come down.

1058
00:55:00,892 --> 00:55:03,688
Otherwise, let me know what
you choose to do, okay?

1059
00:55:03,968 --> 00:55:05,206
Thank you, your Honor.

1060
00:55:05,486 --> 00:55:06,483
Yes, thank you.

1061
00:55:06,764 --> 00:55:07,883
Thank you, your Honor.

1062
00:55:08,203 --> 00:55:09,680
Merry Christmas.

1063
00:55:11,479 --> 00:55:13,396
Merry Christmas.

1064
00:55:14,556 --> 00:55:16,473
Big cruise ships
comin' up through here,

1065
00:55:16,754 --> 00:55:18,471
people tramplin' all over.

1066
00:55:18,752 --> 00:55:19,950
You know,
he says it's gonna bring

1067
00:55:20,231 --> 00:55:21,868
a bunch of money into town.

1068
00:55:22,149 --> 00:55:24,146
'Cause Alaska cruises,
you know, they got a lot

1069
00:55:24,426 --> 00:55:26,463
of retired people, you know,
old people, you know,

1070
00:55:26,784 --> 00:55:31,337
goin' on those shoestring budget
transportation tours together.

1071
00:55:31,658 --> 00:55:34,374
Bunch of old, widowed ladies.

1072
00:55:36,493 --> 00:55:39,529
Old, widowed ladies?

1073
00:55:40,449 --> 00:55:42,285
You got another one of those?

1074
00:55:51,636 --> 00:55:53,114
Coach.

1075
00:55:53,395 --> 00:55:54,392
Mayor.

1076
00:55:54,673 --> 00:55:56,750
Wow, nice button.

1077
00:55:57,070 --> 00:55:58,549
He's gonna bring
the cruise line order

1078
00:55:58,868 --> 00:56:00,187
to the race on Saturday.

1079
00:56:00,467 --> 00:56:01,345
Isn't that great?

1080
00:56:01,626 --> 00:56:03,742
Yeah, that's great.

1081
00:56:04,023 --> 00:56:06,100
See you inside, Coach.

1082
00:56:06,381 --> 00:56:09,057
You know, I can help you
tear this thing down.

1083
00:56:10,736 --> 00:56:12,574
I don't believe you would
actually help me

1084
00:56:12,855 --> 00:56:14,651
even if I planned
on takin' it down.

1085
00:56:14,931 --> 00:56:16,888
Oh, I could hire somebody.

1086
00:56:17,169 --> 00:56:18,646
It's not goin' anywhere.

1087
00:56:18,927 --> 00:56:20,844
Now you heard what
the judge said, Dan.

1088
00:56:21,125 --> 00:56:25,759
There's nothin' religious
about a bunch of planks of wood.

1089
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:27,517
Look, ifyou want
to let it sit here empty,

1090
00:56:27,798 --> 00:56:29,156
that's fine with me.

1091
00:56:29,437 --> 00:56:31,114
I told you that you
were in the minority,

1092
00:56:31,394 --> 00:56:32,592
but you wouldn't listen.

1093
00:56:32,872 --> 00:56:35,509
Guess we'll find out come
spring election, huh?

1094
00:57:12,749 --> 00:57:14,267
I got cocoa.

1095
00:57:14,548 --> 00:57:15,945
Mom, look
at how long mine is.

1096
00:57:16,226 --> 00:57:18,223
No, no, no, no no!

1097
00:57:18,504 --> 00:57:22,338
You always get the railroads,
and I want to be the tycoon.

1098
00:57:22,619 --> 00:57:27,092
Why don't you send some
more marshmallows our way, huh?

1099
00:57:28,213 --> 00:57:31,529
Danny boy,
wife's talkin' to ya.

1100
00:57:32,968 --> 00:57:35,284
He's still mad
'cause he lost.

1101
00:57:35,605 --> 00:57:37,242
Hey, hey, let's
do a midnight run.

1102
00:57:37,563 --> 00:57:39,999
Me, you, and Cody,
we'll take the nativity,

1103
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:41,398
we'll stick it in the church.

1104
00:57:41,678 --> 00:57:43,915
No, no, no, let's
take it to the park.

1105
00:57:44,236 --> 00:57:45,434
That'd make you happy.

1106
00:57:45,714 --> 00:57:47,431
The Grinch ruined Christmas.

1107
00:57:47,712 --> 00:57:49,149
It doesn't make you mad?

1108
00:57:49,430 --> 00:57:51,306
He didn't ruin my Christmas.

1109
00:57:51,587 --> 00:57:53,304
Mine's okay.

1110
00:57:53,585 --> 00:57:55,263
I mean,
I'd be a little grinchy too

1111
00:57:55,544 --> 00:57:56,821
if all I had in my house

1112
00:57:57,142 --> 00:57:59,139
was a little couch
and a suitcase.

1113
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:01,057
What do you mean?

1114
00:58:01,337 --> 00:58:02,336
Yeah.

1115
00:58:02,617 --> 00:58:06,491
We're still talking
about Mitch Bright, right?
you talking about?

1116
00:58:08,609 --> 00:58:10,126
Remember when we
delivered the cookies?

1117
00:58:10,407 --> 00:58:11,445
Well, when I looked
in the window,

1118
00:58:11,766 --> 00:58:14,362
all I saw was a little couch
and a suitcase.

1119
00:58:14,683 --> 00:58:18,878
Wait a minute,
in that whole big house?

1120
00:58:19,158 --> 00:58:23,113
What about his
grandmother's antiques?

1121
00:58:23,434 --> 00:58:25,311
And the moving van?

1122
00:58:25,591 --> 00:58:26,709
Wait a minute.

1123
00:58:26,990 --> 00:58:30,466
Are you tellin' me that the van
was taking antiques

1124
00:58:30,746 --> 00:58:32,382
away from his house?

1125
00:58:32,663 --> 00:58:34,780
Hang on, hang on,
let me try to figure this out.

1126
00:58:35,101 --> 00:58:36,738
I knew somethin' was wrong.

1127
00:58:37,058 --> 00:58:41,133
Okay, so Mitch Bright
comes to town,

1128
00:58:41,414 --> 00:58:43,570
he sells or loses
everything he has.

1129
00:58:43,891 --> 00:58:47,207
He puts on this big show about
how rich, how successful he is,

1130
00:58:47,488 --> 00:58:48,605
how he's gonna save the town.

1131
00:58:48,886 --> 00:58:50,164
He's gonna run for mayor.

1132
00:58:50,445 --> 00:58:53,920
He puts the whole town
on edge over Christmas.

1133
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:56,277
Now that really makes sense.

1134
00:58:56,598 --> 00:59:00,752
I think this makes for a very
interesting story, don't you?

1135
00:59:01,033 --> 00:59:02,351
But what is it?

1136
00:59:02,631 --> 00:59:04,749
Well maybe it's
none of our business.

1137
00:59:05,028 --> 00:59:06,267
Who wants more popcorn?

1138
00:59:06,547 --> 00:59:07,425
Me!

1139
00:59:07,706 --> 00:59:08,944
Cody ate all mine.

1140
00:59:09,265 --> 00:59:10,622
You know what this
means, don't you?

1141
00:59:10,903 --> 00:59:12,220
Road trip.

1142
00:59:12,501 --> 00:59:13,379
Oh, I know that look.

1143
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:16,376
You Reed brothers
are scheming again.

1144
00:59:16,657 --> 00:59:17,854
You know what, honey?

1145
00:59:18,134 --> 00:59:19,611
Greg and I are gonna pay
a little visit

1146
00:59:19,932 --> 00:59:21,290
to Mitch Bright's law firm.

1147
00:59:21,570 --> 00:59:22,768
I'm gonna call Harland.

1148
00:59:23,049 --> 00:59:24,167
I'll have him get
the plane ready.

1149
00:59:24,447 --> 00:59:25,766
All right.

1150
00:59:26,046 --> 00:59:29,401
Your roll, Donald Trump.

1151
00:59:38,833 --> 00:59:42,148
Now, I mean, would it kill
you to let me be left seat once?

1152
00:59:42,468 --> 00:59:44,505
It might.
and we show up to this office,

1153
00:59:47,942 --> 00:59:49,220
you let me do the talking.

1154
00:59:49,501 --> 00:59:50,898
You sure this is a good idea?

1155
00:59:51,219 --> 00:59:52,736
'Cause I'm usually
game for anything.

1156
00:59:53,057 --> 00:59:54,175
I know.

1157
00:59:54,456 --> 00:59:56,733
I hope so.

1158
00:59:57,054 --> 00:59:59,490
I gotta take a wiz.

1159
01:00:03,605 --> 01:00:05,203
You're friends
of Mitch Bright?

1160
01:00:05,483 --> 01:00:07,360
We went to high school
with him.

1161
01:00:07,681 --> 01:00:08,799
We're in town.

1162
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:10,357
Thought we'd
stop by and say hey.

1163
01:00:10,678 --> 01:00:11,835
Well, sorry
to keep you waiting.

1164
01:00:12,116 --> 01:00:13,834
He doesn't work
here anymore.

1165
01:00:14,114 --> 01:00:15,872
Oh.

1166
01:00:16,153 --> 01:00:19,108
Well, maybe you could tell us
what firm he went to or give us

1167
01:00:19,429 --> 01:00:20,627
an address where we
could look him up?

1168
01:00:20,908 --> 01:00:23,743
No.

1169
01:00:25,503 --> 01:00:29,257
What, is it cloak and dagger
or is he big trouble?

1170
01:00:29,538 --> 01:00:31,654
No, sorry, the firm's
just protective.

1171
01:00:34,053 --> 01:00:37,249
Mitch was never
anything but nice to me.

1172
01:00:37,530 --> 01:00:39,327
He gave me a shot
at a few cases a while back

1173
01:00:39,607 --> 01:00:42,444
and he helped me
get on good track here.

1174
01:00:43,843 --> 01:00:45,920
And all I know is is that he
ended up investing in something

1175
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:49,475
he shouldn't have.

1176
01:00:49,796 --> 01:00:52,871
It went south.

1177
01:00:54,870 --> 01:00:59,744
He ended up losing everything,
including his job here.

1178
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:04,259
Then, of course, nobody
ever talks about it.

1179
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:06,058
I don't know where he went

1180
01:01:06,379 --> 01:01:08,136
or if he has any family
or friends to go to.

1181
01:01:08,417 --> 01:01:13,610
Well, his family's gone,
but he has--you know,

1182
01:01:13,889 --> 01:01:15,368
he has friends.

1183
01:01:15,648 --> 01:01:17,405
Like you guys?

1184
01:01:17,686 --> 01:01:18,843
Yeah.

1185
01:01:19,124 --> 01:01:21,001
Yeah, right.

1186
01:01:21,282 --> 01:01:25,317
When you see him,
you give him this.

1187
01:01:25,598 --> 01:01:29,033
Just tell him it's from an old
friend or do it anonymously.

1188
01:01:29,314 --> 01:01:31,031
I don't think that we could--

1189
01:01:31,312 --> 01:01:33,508
No, please.
to take it, but he needs it.

1190
01:01:37,744 --> 01:01:40,580
He really helped me
out a lot back then.

1191
01:01:40,861 --> 01:01:44,217
I just want to help him.

1192
01:01:45,256 --> 01:01:48,292
Well, that's all I know,
so I better get back to work.

1193
01:01:48,573 --> 01:01:49,691
Good luck to both of you.

1194
01:01:49,971 --> 01:01:51,849
Yeah, thanks for--

1195
01:01:52,169 --> 01:01:54,087
Good luck
and Merry Christmas.

1196
01:01:54,367 --> 01:01:57,402
Merry Christmas to you.

1197
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:05,274
So he's ruined, he comes
back to town hiding the fact.

1198
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:07,831
What do you think
he's trying to do?

1199
01:02:08,112 --> 01:02:09,869
Get a life back.

1200
01:02:10,150 --> 01:02:12,027
Not a very good strategy
to run for mayor

1201
01:02:12,308 --> 01:02:13,905
while lying to everybody.

1202
01:02:14,186 --> 01:02:15,544
Yeah.

1203
01:02:15,824 --> 01:02:18,500
You know, I think this
whole cruise line thing

1204
01:02:18,781 --> 01:02:21,496
is just to get back in the game.

1205
01:02:21,777 --> 01:02:26,491
Maybe people will forgive him
when they find out the truth.

1206
01:02:27,491 --> 01:02:29,768
Or we could run him
out of here on a rail.

1207
01:02:30,088 --> 01:02:32,844
Yeah, that'd show him
the real spirit of Christmas.

1208
01:02:33,165 --> 01:02:34,323
It'd sure feel good.

1209
01:02:34,604 --> 01:02:36,441
Yeah.

1210
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:39,238
Hey, Dad.

1211
01:02:39,519 --> 01:02:40,516
Hey, pal.
What's up?

1212
01:02:40,837 --> 01:02:42,354
Can you help me
with these?

1213
01:02:42,635 --> 01:02:43,633
Sure.

1214
01:02:43,953 --> 01:02:46,270
Sure.
See you guys.

1215
01:02:46,551 --> 01:02:47,468
See you.

1216
01:02:47,789 --> 01:02:50,385
Ah, grab this
thing, will you?

1217
01:02:51,944 --> 01:02:53,343
What's up, man?

1218
01:02:53,663 --> 01:02:56,300
You know that girl
I was telling you about?

1219
01:02:56,620 --> 01:02:59,136
Uh, not sure.

1220
01:03:00,456 --> 01:03:02,413
You know, she's
always trying to beat me.

1221
01:03:02,694 --> 01:03:03,811
We talked about it.

1222
01:03:04,092 --> 01:03:05,250
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1223
01:03:05,531 --> 01:03:06,847
What happened?

1224
01:03:07,168 --> 01:03:10,843
Well, see, we were racing.

1225
01:03:11,164 --> 01:03:12,282
Yeah.

1226
01:03:12,563 --> 01:03:16,877
She was winning,
but then she fell and hurt.

1227
01:03:17,158 --> 01:03:19,674
I thought it was my fault.

1228
01:03:19,995 --> 01:03:22,472
That's why I wasn't
going to enter the Cup.

1229
01:03:24,351 --> 01:03:27,307
She bribed me to race.

1230
01:03:27,627 --> 01:03:30,222
Does this make
any sense to you?

1231
01:03:30,543 --> 01:03:31,381
Not really.

1232
01:03:31,702 --> 01:03:32,819
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1233
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:34,219
I forgot something.

1234
01:03:34,538 --> 01:03:37,495
So what did you do
when she hurt herself?

1235
01:03:37,775 --> 01:03:40,052
I helped her back, of course.

1236
01:03:40,373 --> 01:03:42,290
I mean, I'm not a jerk.

1237
01:03:42,570 --> 01:03:44,247
Aw, you helped her all
the way back to school.

1238
01:03:44,528 --> 01:03:46,446
Oh, that was nice.

1239
01:03:46,726 --> 01:03:49,722
I'm sure she really
appreciated that.

1240
01:03:50,043 --> 01:03:52,239
She usually pretty fast?

1241
01:03:52,519 --> 01:03:53,956
Yeah, she's good.

1242
01:03:54,237 --> 01:03:55,436
Faster than you.

1243
01:03:55,716 --> 01:03:56,994
At least that day.

1244
01:03:57,274 --> 01:03:58,353
Yeah.

1245
01:03:58,633 --> 01:04:00,151
Careful, that's hot.

1246
01:04:00,432 --> 01:04:03,866
How are you at losing?

1247
01:04:04,147 --> 01:04:06,304
I try to be a good sport,
you know,

1248
01:04:06,625 --> 01:04:09,341
but it makes me mad
when I lose.

1249
01:04:12,339 --> 01:04:15,293
I wonder where
he got that from.

1250
01:04:15,614 --> 01:04:16,573
Seems like somebody's
listening in

1251
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:18,450
on our conversation.

1252
01:04:18,731 --> 01:04:21,887
You guys are
so slow sometimes.

1253
01:04:23,446 --> 01:04:25,243
We do things
at our own speed.

1254
01:04:25,524 --> 01:04:28,201
It's called man time.

1255
01:04:28,481 --> 01:04:30,878
I'm getting to it.

1256
01:04:31,199 --> 01:04:35,713
Look, I don't think it's
the race she's trying to win.

1257
01:04:37,471 --> 01:04:39,348
I think it's you.

1258
01:04:39,629 --> 01:04:42,465
She's always bothering me.

1259
01:04:44,504 --> 01:04:48,658
Look, you have to get
past the competition.

1260
01:04:48,939 --> 01:04:50,257
You have to see the person.

1261
01:04:50,578 --> 01:04:51,735
She's just a young girl.

1262
01:04:52,016 --> 01:04:53,773
She got all this stuff
going on inside of her.

1263
01:04:54,054 --> 01:04:57,849
She doesn't know how
to express it, right?

1264
01:04:59,848 --> 01:05:02,803
Is that what you're doing?

1265
01:05:03,083 --> 01:05:05,201
Seeing the person there?

1266
01:05:05,481 --> 01:05:07,717
What do you mean?

1267
01:05:07,998 --> 01:05:11,314
With Mitch.

1268
01:05:11,595 --> 01:05:13,072
You've been doing all this
investigating, you know,

1269
01:05:13,353 --> 01:05:19,306
so I was just wondering if
you had him figured out too.

1270
01:05:19,586 --> 01:05:22,422
I don't know.

1271
01:05:22,743 --> 01:05:28,576
Look, you race tomorrow.

1272
01:05:28,856 --> 01:05:30,174
Do the best you can.

1273
01:05:30,454 --> 01:05:33,091
Win or lose, you have
worked so hard for this.

1274
01:05:33,372 --> 01:05:38,206
You just go out there
and give it everything you have.

1275
01:05:38,526 --> 01:05:40,163
All right?
You owe that to yourself.

1276
01:05:40,484 --> 01:05:43,281
Yes, sir.

1277
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:48,274
Is she--is she cute?

1278
01:05:48,554 --> 01:05:50,032
Yeah.

1279
01:05:50,313 --> 01:05:53,189
That's my boy.

1280
01:06:06,776 --> 01:06:08,852
Hey, Dan, I haven't seen
Mitch and his big guest yet,

1281
01:06:09,133 --> 01:06:10,210
have you?

1282
01:06:10,531 --> 01:06:11,649
No.

1283
01:06:11,930 --> 01:06:13,887
He's coming, isn't he?
Right?

1284
01:06:14,168 --> 01:06:15,925
Mitch promised he would.

1285
01:06:16,205 --> 01:06:17,722
I guess we'll see.

1286
01:06:18,003 --> 01:06:22,078
Sure hope he makes it 'cause
you remember, like you said,

1287
01:06:22,399 --> 01:06:25,275
be good for my business.

1288
01:06:29,871 --> 01:06:31,667
Loser takes the winner
for moose burgers.

1289
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:34,264
I've already got
the money in my pocket.

1290
01:06:34,545 --> 01:06:37,421
All right, let's race.

1291
01:06:39,060 --> 01:06:41,817
On your mark.

1292
01:06:42,098 --> 01:06:43,255
Go!

1293
01:07:41,313 --> 01:07:42,392
Come on, Cody!

1294
01:07:42,672 --> 01:07:45,428
You're doing great!

1295
01:07:48,506 --> 01:07:51,342
Cody!

1296
01:07:51,623 --> 01:07:53,260
Still my best time ever.

1297
01:07:53,541 --> 01:07:56,217
Still owe me a moose burger.

1298
01:07:56,498 --> 01:07:59,334
Nice!

1299
01:08:01,813 --> 01:08:03,968
Here we go.
Watch your step, please.

1300
01:08:04,249 --> 01:08:05,167
Thanks so much.

1301
01:08:05,448 --> 01:08:06,606
Thanks for coming.
Appreciate it.

1302
01:08:06,886 --> 01:08:08,004
Hope you got
some good photos.

1303
01:08:08,285 --> 01:08:09,162
Reed brothers.

1304
01:08:09,443 --> 01:08:10,601
Thanks, guys.

1305
01:08:10,882 --> 01:08:12,319
Thanks for coming.
Appreciate it.

1306
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:13,639
Thanks, guys.

1307
01:08:13,918 --> 01:08:15,037
Whoo!

1308
01:08:15,317 --> 01:08:16,195
Wow, they had
great weather, right?

1309
01:08:16,516 --> 01:08:18,234
Oh man,
we got 20, 30 shots.

1310
01:08:18,555 --> 01:08:21,310
Hey, Mitch.

1311
01:08:21,591 --> 01:08:26,104
I know everybody in town's
talking about today.

1312
01:08:27,624 --> 01:08:30,539
My contact
from the cruise ship canceled.

1313
01:08:30,820 --> 01:08:32,498
I'm not saying
the deal's done.

1314
01:08:32,779 --> 01:08:37,293
I just--I don't know,
Christmas Eve or something.

1315
01:08:37,574 --> 01:08:39,011
Oh yeah.

1316
01:08:39,292 --> 01:08:41,209
No, we got you Mitch.

1317
01:08:41,489 --> 01:08:43,526
He's probably
at home with his family.

1318
01:08:43,847 --> 01:08:46,523
I just thought it would only
be right that I come down

1319
01:08:46,844 --> 01:08:49,560
and tell you myself.

1320
01:08:49,839 --> 01:08:56,352
You know, when I was a little
kid growing up in this town,

1321
01:08:56,633 --> 01:08:59,349
I was always
jealous of you two.

1322
01:09:02,986 --> 01:09:06,501
Never told you that before.

1323
01:09:15,891 --> 01:09:19,407
You got to give
him that money.

1324
01:09:20,886 --> 01:09:25,122
Let's get her cleaned up.

1325
01:09:25,403 --> 01:09:29,837
Come on.

1326
01:09:42,423 --> 01:09:43,621
Hi.

1327
01:09:43,902 --> 01:09:45,060
Been such a pleasant day.

1328
01:09:45,380 --> 01:09:46,897
Not one mention
of Mitch Bright all day.

1329
01:09:47,218 --> 01:09:48,337
Are you ready?

1330
01:09:48,617 --> 01:09:50,974
Yeah.

1331
01:10:16,547 --> 01:10:21,420
I love it.

1332
01:10:21,821 --> 01:10:23,898
I bring you good tidings
of great joy

1333
01:10:24,219 --> 01:10:27,335
that shall be unto all people.

1334
01:10:27,615 --> 01:10:30,571
I bring you good news
of great joy

1335
01:10:30,852 --> 01:10:35,166
that shall be unto all people.

1336
01:10:35,447 --> 01:10:37,523
Today in the town of David,
a savior is born,

1337
01:10:37,844 --> 01:10:39,003
Christ the Lord.

1338
01:10:39,283 --> 01:10:40,161
Go find this baby.

1339
01:10:40,442 --> 01:10:42,159
You will find him wrapped
in swaddling cloth

1340
01:10:42,439 --> 01:10:45,674
and laying in a manger.

1341
01:11:25,673 --> 01:11:31,745
I have something for you.

1342
01:11:32,025 --> 01:11:34,303
It's from an old friend.

1343
01:11:34,622 --> 01:11:38,498
He asked me
not to tell you who.

1344
01:11:38,779 --> 01:11:42,973
How did he know
where to find me?

1345
01:11:43,294 --> 01:11:45,171
You know who it's from?

1346
01:11:45,452 --> 01:11:47,688
Yeah, it's the exact amount
of money I lent him

1347
01:11:47,969 --> 01:11:49,806
over 2 years ago.

1348
01:11:50,127 --> 01:11:54,240
He was working as a clerk and he
and his wife were having a baby.

1349
01:11:54,521 --> 01:11:58,316
Don't you have
a church service to go to?

1350
01:11:58,597 --> 01:12:03,391
It's over by now.

1351
01:12:03,712 --> 01:12:07,547
This was more important
for me tonight.

1352
01:12:07,827 --> 01:12:13,661
Mitch, is there
anything else you need?

1353
01:12:15,978 --> 01:12:18,615
No, I mean, why would I?

1354
01:12:18,895 --> 01:12:21,212
Joy to the world.

1355
01:12:21,493 --> 01:12:23,250
The Lord has come.

1356
01:12:23,531 --> 01:12:24,848
What is that?

1357
01:12:25,169 --> 01:12:28,325
Let earth receive her king.

1358
01:12:28,605 --> 01:12:34,478
Let every heart
prepare him room.

1359
01:12:34,759 --> 01:12:36,875
And heaven and nature sing.

1360
01:12:37,156 --> 01:12:39,232
Let heaven and nature sing.

1361
01:12:39,513 --> 01:12:46,185
Let heaven and heaven
and nature sing.

1362
01:12:49,822 --> 01:12:52,579
Thought we'd find you here.

1363
01:12:52,860 --> 01:12:55,296
I wasn't expecting visitors.

1364
01:12:55,616 --> 01:12:58,132
Well, we weren't
expecting to come.

1365
01:12:58,453 --> 01:13:01,608
But a little angel told us that
you didn't get a proper welcome

1366
01:13:01,889 --> 01:13:03,886
when you came to town.

1367
01:13:04,207 --> 01:13:06,203
We thought we'd better
take care of that.

1368
01:13:06,484 --> 01:13:07,682
Did you get my cookies?

1369
01:13:07,962 --> 01:13:09,321
Yes I did, honey.

1370
01:13:09,601 --> 01:13:11,278
Thank you.
They were delicious.

1371
01:13:11,559 --> 01:13:12,477
We brought you some more.

1372
01:13:12,757 --> 01:13:15,434
Can we come in?

1373
01:13:30,858 --> 01:13:32,216
Hey, Mitchell boy!

1374
01:13:32,536 --> 01:13:34,213
Hope you don't mind,
but we brought

1375
01:13:34,534 --> 01:13:36,211
the Christmas Eve pageant
up here.

1376
01:13:36,532 --> 01:13:39,528
These are not
Christmas presents, all right?

1377
01:13:39,809 --> 01:13:41,766
These is a housewarming gifts
because who doesn't celebrate

1378
01:13:42,046 --> 01:13:43,763
a warm house?

1379
01:13:44,044 --> 01:13:45,641
Can we bring 'em in?

1380
01:13:45,922 --> 01:13:48,518
All right, let's move.

1381
01:14:09,417 --> 01:14:12,132
Well, I don't know about
you guys, but I am freezing.

1382
01:14:12,453 --> 01:14:17,167
And a lot of pie made
it up here tonight.

1383
01:14:33,151 --> 01:14:35,428
Come on in!

1384
01:14:42,022 --> 01:14:45,337
Ta-da!

1385
01:14:48,535 --> 01:14:51,011
All right.

1386
01:14:58,524 --> 01:15:00,281
Got a beautiful place
here, brother.

1387
01:15:00,561 --> 01:15:03,518
Beautiful place.

1388
01:15:03,798 --> 01:15:05,715
Merry Christmas.

1389
01:15:05,996 --> 01:15:08,233
Enjoy.

1390
01:15:13,469 --> 01:15:15,305
Now, does Mary go
on the right or the left?

1391
01:15:15,586 --> 01:15:16,464
She goes left.

1392
01:15:16,745 --> 01:15:17,902
You sure?

1393
01:15:18,183 --> 01:15:19,300
That's it.

1394
01:15:19,581 --> 01:15:20,459
We're just taking them down.

1395
01:15:20,780 --> 01:15:22,177
All right, all right.

1396
01:15:22,458 --> 01:15:23,695
Hang on one sec.

1397
01:15:23,976 --> 01:15:25,054
Hang on, hang on.

1398
01:15:25,335 --> 01:15:27,652
Hey, lookie lookie.

1399
01:15:27,933 --> 01:15:30,049
I know you.

1400
01:15:30,330 --> 01:15:32,247
Hello, Mitch.

1401
01:15:32,568 --> 01:15:34,924
How are you?

1402
01:15:35,205 --> 01:15:36,962
You know we got a right
to put these out, right?

1403
01:15:37,283 --> 01:15:39,280
We bought it from the town.

1404
01:15:39,561 --> 01:15:42,276
Got permission to put
it up in a public place.

1405
01:15:42,556 --> 01:15:43,554
I'm not ashamed
ofJesus, Mitch.

1406
01:15:43,835 --> 01:15:46,391
Never gonna be.

1407
01:15:46,672 --> 01:15:48,589
Freedom of religion.

1408
01:15:48,870 --> 01:15:53,024
It's what makes
America great, right?

1409
01:15:53,305 --> 01:15:54,264
Amen, brother.

1410
01:15:54,543 --> 01:15:56,381
That's right.

1411
01:15:59,180 --> 01:16:01,056
That's a copy of the order
to drop the complaint

1412
01:16:01,337 --> 01:16:03,413
and the injunction.

1413
01:16:03,734 --> 01:16:06,290
Couple of crazy Christians
changed my mind.

1414
01:16:06,610 --> 01:16:09,246
They can do that.

1415
01:16:09,567 --> 01:16:11,724
What's this one?

1416
01:16:12,005 --> 01:16:14,921
E-mail from
a cruise line contact.

1417
01:16:15,202 --> 01:16:17,079
Says he's sorry
he missed the plane.

1418
01:16:17,399 --> 01:16:21,314
Wants to come up in January
with some of his partners.

1419
01:16:21,595 --> 01:16:23,272
So I'm thinking this town
needs to beef up their

1420
01:16:23,553 --> 01:16:25,430
chamber of commerce ASAP
and you're going to need

1421
01:16:25,710 --> 01:16:28,106
somebody who knows
what he's doing.

1422
01:16:28,387 --> 01:16:31,103
I know the right man
for the job.

1423
01:16:31,384 --> 01:16:33,221
Will you help us?

1424
01:16:35,859 --> 01:16:38,096
Well, that would
mean I'd have to set aside

1425
01:16:38,377 --> 01:16:40,893
my campaign for mayor.

1426
01:16:41,174 --> 01:16:42,212
Oh, please.

1427
01:16:42,492 --> 01:16:43,890
I'm up in pre-election
polls, you know.

1428
01:16:44,171 --> 01:16:45,448
I don't think so.

1429
01:16:45,769 --> 01:16:49,045
I hear there's a city council
position opening up.

1430
01:16:54,639 --> 01:16:56,835
Peace on earth.

1431
01:16:57,116 --> 01:17:00,312
Goodwill to men.

1432
01:17:00,593 --> 01:17:02,870
Merry Christmas.

1433
01:17:03,190 --> 01:17:04,188
Merry Christmas to you.

1434
01:17:04,469 --> 01:17:06,865
Merry Christmas.

1435
01:17:07,186 --> 01:17:09,662
You want to help us out?

1436
01:17:09,983 --> 01:17:12,299
Ho ho, got to go!
Thank you.

1437
01:17:12,580 --> 01:17:15,056
Some things never change.

1438
01:17:15,337 --> 01:17:16,374
You know what?

1439
01:17:16,655 --> 01:17:19,052
Let's go with--get one
of the kings, will you?

1440
01:17:19,332 --> 01:17:20,450
I want--yeah.

1441
01:17:20,771 --> 01:17:23,927
Come on, come on.
It's in your allowance.

1442
01:17:24,208 --> 01:17:25,964
You know what?

1443
01:17:26,485 --> 01:17:28,042
Oh, come on!

1444
01:17:28,323 --> 01:17:29,201
I'll help.

1445
01:17:29,522 --> 01:17:30,640
Merry Christmas!

1446
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:32,039
Merry Christmas.

1447
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:33,317
Come on, Code.
You know what?

1448
01:17:33,638 --> 01:17:34,795
Why don't you take Mary?

1449
01:17:35,075 --> 01:17:36,193
There you go.

1450
01:17:36,514 --> 01:17:37,391
That's it.
Thanks, Cody.

1451
01:17:37,672 --> 01:17:39,110
There you go, Mitch.
Mitch, meet Mary.

1452
01:17:39,431 --> 01:17:40,309
We're together again.

1453
01:17:40,589 --> 01:17:42,426
That's the big lady.
Take care of her.
Thank you.

1454
01:17:43,707 --> 01:17:45,943
All right, watch the ear.
Thanks, son.

1455
01:17:46,264 --> 01:17:49,259
Came off 2 years ago.

1456
01:18:38,982 --> 01:18:40,385
I remember when people
used to say things like,

1457
01:18:40,666 --> 01:18:41,990
"Merry Christmas" to each other.

1458
01:18:42,311 --> 01:18:44,036
Everybody said,
"Merry Christmas!

1459
01:18:44,358 --> 01:18:47,847
Hey, Merry Christmas
to you, Mr. Lowenstein."

1460
01:18:50,175 --> 01:18:51,298
You know why?

1461
01:18:51,580 --> 01:18:52,702
'Cause it wasn't
about a religion.

1462
01:18:53,023 --> 01:18:54,265
It was about something
as a culture we thought

1463
01:18:54,548 --> 01:18:55,952
was so valuable that we would
all do it together,

1464
01:18:56,233 --> 01:18:58,319
even if I disagreed with
the religion behind it.

1465
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:00,686
Because it was good
for all, instead ofjust me.

1466
01:19:01,007 --> 01:19:01,888
But what do people say now?

1467
01:19:02,171 --> 01:19:04,496
"Happy Holidays."

1468
01:19:04,818 --> 01:19:05,941
See, I just say,
"Happy Holidays"

1469
01:19:06,222 --> 01:19:07,104
because I won't say Christmas

1470
01:19:07,386 --> 01:19:08,508
because you don't
believe in Christmas

1471
01:19:08,830 --> 01:19:10,914
because I don't
want to offend you...

1472
01:20:45,396 --> 01:20:47,241
Oh yes, we want to say,
"Happy Holidays"

1473
01:20:47,522 --> 01:20:48,806
because we don't want
to leave anybody out, really?

1474
01:20:49,088 --> 01:20:50,530
How come there's a ton
of holidays in February?

1475
01:20:50,812 --> 01:20:52,014
Nobody ever says,
"Happy Holidays"

1476
01:20:52,296 --> 01:20:53,179
in February, do they?

1477
01:20:53,500 --> 01:20:55,264
"Happy Valentines."

1478
01:20:55,587 --> 01:20:57,150
Ooh, you believe in love?

1479
01:20:59,598 --> 01:21:00,961
But nobody wants
to say, "Christmas."

1480
01:21:01,243 --> 01:21:02,486
Everything else but Christmas.

1481
01:21:02,768 --> 01:21:04,051
Why? I know why.
You do too.

1482
01:21:04,372 --> 01:21:06,698
It's because it's got Christ
in it and after 2000 years,

1483
01:21:06,980 --> 01:21:08,999
he's still intimidating people.
