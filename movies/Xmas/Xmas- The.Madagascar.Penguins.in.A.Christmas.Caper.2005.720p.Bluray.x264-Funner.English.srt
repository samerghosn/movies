4
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,480
He looks so sad.

5
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:58,700
Rico!

6
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:00,760
I want that tree up to muster.

7
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,941
Check!
Kowalski!

8
00:01:04,942 --> 00:01:08,030
What's the status on the approved
musical selection?

9
00:01:08,031 --> 00:01:09,500
It's scheduled to begin...

10
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,590
...now.

11
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,280
<i>Excelente!</i>

12
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:13,281
Right on track.

13
00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:14,282
Skipper!

14
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:16,100
Veggie pudding at 1900 hours.

15
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,980
ULOG to commence on my mark.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,040
Engage!

17
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,900
ULOG engaged.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,238
- Checkamundo!
- Skipper!

19
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:25,218
Eggnog at 2100 hours.

20
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,660
Writing our names in the snow at 21:05.

21
00:01:27,661 --> 00:01:29,170
- Skipper!
- What is it, Private?

22
00:01:29,231 --> 00:01:33,300
Ted, the polar bear, is all alone
this holiday, and he seems so sad!

23
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,361
Could we bring him a present
to cheer him up?

24
00:01:35,536 --> 00:01:36,600
Kowalski!

25
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,200
Negative, Skipper.

26
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,711
We have four presents,
and there are four of us.

27
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:41,930
We can go and get him something.

28
00:01:41,931 --> 00:01:43,760
Sorry, Private, no can do.

29
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:46,260
But no one should be sad
and alone in Christmas.

30
00:01:46,261 --> 00:01:47,020
Exactly.

31
00:01:47,021 --> 00:01:49,820
So, throw those troubles away
and be merry.

32
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:51,670
- Pronto!
- But, Skipper...

33
00:01:51,671 --> 00:01:53,030
That's an order, mister.

34
00:01:53,031 --> 00:01:55,770
All right, boys,
stand by for eggnog.

35
00:01:55,771 --> 00:01:56,650
Aye, aye, Skipper.

36
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,690
- Eggnog!
- Private?

37
00:01:58,691 --> 00:02:01,100
- I'll pass, thank you.
- <i>Eggnog, eggnog, eggnog... </i>

00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:11,600
<i>Chug, chug, chug..!</i>

40
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:12,950
Well done, Rico!

41
00:02:12,951 --> 00:02:15,600
<i>This guy can really hold his nog. </i>

42
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,800
2110 hours, boys.

43
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,320
Engage cranberries.

44
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,230
Rico!

45
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,440
Not at the table.

46
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,940
Hold on a second.

47
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,240
Something's missing...

48
00:02:28,241 --> 00:02:30,480
Cranberries, check.
Eggnog, check.

49
00:02:30,481 --> 00:02:31,920
Give me a head count.

50
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,450
We have three heads, sir.

51
00:02:33,451 --> 00:02:34,670
Where's the Private?

52
00:02:34,671 --> 00:02:37,560
I don't know,
it would appear that he's... missing.

53
00:02:37,561 --> 00:02:39,760
Missing?
Hoover Damn!

54
00:02:39,761 --> 00:02:41,640
Wait.
There he is!

55
00:02:41,641 --> 00:02:43,180
He just went to bed.

56
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,530
What the..?
What have you done with Private?

57
00:02:46,531 --> 00:02:47,470
Talk, mister!

58
00:02:47,471 --> 00:02:48,080
<i>Skipper!</i>

59
00:02:48,081 --> 00:02:49,040
Over here.

60
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:51,090
I'll deal with you later.

61
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,420
Oh, no! He must be out there
all by himself.

62
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,000
He's one of us, men,
you all know the penguin credo.

63
00:02:58,001 --> 00:02:59,880
"Never bathe in hot oil and Bisquick"?

64
00:02:59,881 --> 00:03:00,980
No!

65
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,560
No! That's the walrus credo!

66
00:03:03,561 --> 00:03:05,470
"Never swim alone. "

67
00:03:05,471 --> 00:03:07,550
Private's out there all by himself...

68
00:03:07,551 --> 00:03:09,700
...and we never leave one of our own.

69
00:03:09,701 --> 00:03:11,660
Oh... yeah.

70
00:03:11,661 --> 00:03:12,450
Now, let's go!

71
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,230
Oh! That's perfect!

72
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,830
Just the thing for a sad polar bear.

73
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,090
Kowalski?
Analysis.

74
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,670
Adrenalin sweating sardines.
These tracks are fresh.

75
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,770
He's close, I can feel it.

76
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,610
<i>What kind of cut-rate junk is this?</i>

77
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,060
<i>It's lousy workmanship,
that's what it is. </i>

78
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:53,440
<i>We may have a problem. </i>

79
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:56,840
<i>Look at all this junk,
these are no good at all! Junk!</i>

80
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,890
We need to get closer.
10 o'clock, men.

81
00:03:59,891 --> 00:04:01,560
Plan, plan, plan!

82
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:10,780
<i>So this is where you're hiding
all the good stuff!</i>

83
00:04:10,781 --> 00:04:11,740
He's in trouble!

84
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,020
- Kaboom.
- Lay down, soldier!

85
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,300
We're in observation mode.

86
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,000
Now, this is workmanship.

87
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:22,720
So, where's the goshdang squeaker
on this thing?

88
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,310
It's gotta have a squeaker...

89
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,420
Now, that's more like it.

90
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,350
<i>Hey, stupid! I want this one. </i>

91
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:30,150
- Grand Coulee Dam!
- <i>Where's my change?!</i>

92
00:04:30,151 --> 00:04:31,350
Private's been captured!

93
00:04:31,351 --> 00:04:32,550
Taxi!

94
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,980
Not on my watch, blue hair.

95
00:04:35,981 --> 00:04:36,981
Kowalski!

96
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:42,050
Hey, I'm walking here!

97
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,880
Do I got a tip for you?
Drop dead!

98
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,910
Good evening, m'am,
Merry Christmas to you.

99
00:04:58,911 --> 00:05:00,000
Buzz off!

100
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,090
Skipper...

101
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,520
How are we gonna get inside?

102
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,200
Kaboom, kaboom.

103
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,030
I have a better idea.

104
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,040
Oh, boy, that's gonna hurt!

105
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,950
Very generous, sir.
You have a Merry Christmas.

106
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,110
Hold that elevator!

107
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:26,910
<i>- Skipper!
- Private!</i>

108
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,490
Step on it, Kowalski.

109
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,140
What comes down, must go up.

110
00:05:45,141 --> 00:05:46,240
Skipper.

111
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:48,600
All right, men.

112

- No more Mr. Cute and cuddly.
- Kaboom, kaboom, kaboom!

115
00:06:14,201 --> 00:06:16,800
Rico! Enough with the dynamite already.

116
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:21,690
Why does Christmas
have to be every year?

117
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,430
What a pain in the..!

118
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,620
The taping... it's so sticky!

119
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:28,798
There we go!

120
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,017
Oh, you'll make such a nice
Christmas present...

121
00:06:32,018 --> 00:06:34,000
...for my Mr. Chew.

122
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,900
Oh, no Mr. Chew,

123
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,381
you'll have to wait until morning
to open your present.

124
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,830
Yes you do.
Who is mommy's big boy?

125
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,310
Who is he?

126
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,330
Nice doggie!
Good doggie!

127
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:03,563
Good boy, down, down,
don't eat me...

128
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,200
...no, no, good boy,
leave me alone, don't eat me!

129
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,030
Santa Claus has come to town.

130
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:12,180
Skipper!

131
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,430
Help me, guys!

132
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,740
- Kowalski, secure the Private.
- I'm on it.

133
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:27,510
Watch your back.
Canine, two o'clock.

134
00:07:27,511 --> 00:07:29,730
- I'm gonna need some cover fire.
- Rico!

135
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,610
- Kowalski! Status?
- Almost there, Skipper.

136
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,940
Let him have it, Rico.

137
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,650
Holy butterball!

138
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:08,470
No, no, don't eat me!

139
00:08:08,471 --> 00:08:10,270
Kowalski!
Give me options.

140
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Skipper.

141
00:08:13,001 --> 00:08:14,160

Kaboom?

Yes, Rico. Kaboom.

153
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Come on, boys.

154
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,230
What is all this?

155
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:17,050
Mr. Chew, this is all your fault!

156
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:18,540
Bad dog!

157
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:20,960

00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:26,450
Thank nothing of it, young Private.

160
00:09:26,451 --> 00:09:27,940
It's the least we could do.

161
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,400
You remember the penguin credo?

162
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:32,490
What does deep frying in Bisquick
have to do with any of this?

163
00:09:32,491 --> 00:09:34,480
Not that one! The other one!

On Christmas! Don't you get it?

167
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:42,580
Come on, people, do I have
to explain this to everybody?

168
00:09:42,581 --> 00:09:47,160
Poor Ted, he's all alone on Christmas,
with no one to swim with.

169
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,760
It's not too late,
young Private.

170
00:09:51,761 --> 00:09:54,420
I've got a new plan to fit him in.

171
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,490

172
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,333

Well, there it is then,
Merry Christmas for everyone.

Who could that be?

175
00:10:08,471 --> 00:10:10,180
Oh, I hope you don't mind.

176
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,730
I invited a few friends over.

177
00:10:12,731 --> 00:10:13,540
