2
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:53,946
Yes.

3
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,198
Quite dead.

4
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,119
As a doornail.

5
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,541
Certificate of death, sir.

6
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:16,904
Stop!

7
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:20,574
Back away, praddock.

8
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:34,505
Tuppence is tuppence.

9
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:00,614
- Beg your pardon!
- I say!

10
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:42,490
Delinquents.

11
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:44,950
Newspaper!

12
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:53,102
We're hungry, sir!

13
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:56,856
Please, sir, we're very hungry.

14
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,440
Any morsel. We're hungry, sir.

15
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,192
- Any scraps.
- We're starving,

16
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,027
Please, sir. We're very hungry.

17
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:06,907
Oh! Merry Christmas,
from his lordship, the mayor!

18
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:09,618
- Please, sir.
- Oh, look. There it is.

19
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,996
Oi! Come back here with that!
That's our meat!

20
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:14,290
Give it back! That's ours!
Come back here!

21
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,439
- There you are, sir.
- Thanks.

22
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,399
Fresh hot chestnuts.

23
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,985
- How would you like this one?
- That's perfect.

24
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:46,363
That's a nice fresh eel.

25
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:49,658
Here is the Father, the Son
and the Holy Ghost. Get lost.

26
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:53,412
And under which one is the pea?
Boom, boom, boom, boom...

27
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:55,623
Boom! Get out of here.

28
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:59,668
There we are. Watch this now.

29
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:47,943
Merry Christmas, Uncle!

30
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:52,322
- God save you.
- Bah! Humbug!

31
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:55,242
Christmas a humbug?
Uncle! You don't mean that.

32
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,578
Merry Christmas.

33
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,205
What reason have you to be merry?
You're poor enough.

34
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,708
What right have you to be so dismal?
You're rich enough.

35
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:06,420
- Humbug!
- Don't be cross, Uncle.

36
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:11,717
What else can I be when I live
in such a world of fools as this?

37
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:14,011
Merry Christmas.

38
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:17,723
What's Christmastime to you but
a time for paying bills without money.

39
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:21,602
A time for finding yourself a year older
and not a penny richer.

40
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,228
If I could work my will,

41
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:26,565
every idiot who goes about
with "Merry Christmas" on his lips

42
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,567
should be boiled in his own pudding

43
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,694
and buried with a stake of holly
through his heart!

44
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,654
- Uncle!
- Nephew!

45
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:37,493
Keep Christmas in your own way
and let me keep it in mine.

46
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,412
Keep it? But you don't keep it!

47
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:44,083
Let me leave it alone then.

48
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,336
Much good it has ever done you.

49
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,173
There are many things from which I have
derived good and have not profited.

50
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,217
Christmas being among them.

51
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:57,346
But I have always thought of Christmas
as a kind, charitable time.

52
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,765
The only time when men
open their shut-up hearts

53
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,518
and think of all people
as fellow travellers to the grave

54
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:06,313
and not some other race of creatures
bound on other journeys.

55
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,815
And therefore, Uncle,

56
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:12,945
although it has never put a scrap
of gold or silver in my pocket,

57
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:17,032
I believe it has done me good,
and I say, God bless it!

58
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:22,204
Let me hear another
sound out of you, Cratchit,

59
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:25,874
and you'll keep Christmas
by losing your situation!

60
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:35,467
You're quite a powerful speaker, sir.
A wonder you don't go into Parliament.

61
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:39,429
Don't be cross, Uncle.
Come, dine with us tomorrow.

62
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:42,307
I'll see you in hell first.

63
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:46,228
But why?
Why so cold-hearted, Uncle? Why?

64
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,731
Why did you get married?

65
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,403
Because I fell in love.

66
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,947
Because...

67
00:10:58,116 --> 00:10:59,741
...you fell...

68
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,579
...in love?

69
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,419
Good afternoon.

70
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:15,174
I want nothing from you.
I ask nothing of you.

71
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:18,093
- Why can't we be friends?
- Good afternoon.

72
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:22,598
I'm sorry, with all my heart,
to find you so resolute.

73
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,350
But I have made the trial
in homage to Christmas, and therefore,

74
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:28,020
- merry Christmas, Uncle!
- Good afternoon!

75
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,606
- And a happy New Year!
- Good afternoon!

76
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,358
And a very merry Christmas
to you too, Mr Cratchit.

77
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:35,319
Merry Christmas to you, sir.

78
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,155
There's another one.

79
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:41,200
A clerk making 15 shillings a week...

80
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:45,621
...and with a wife and family,
talking about a merry Christmas.

81
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,497
I'll retire to Bedlam.

82
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:52,252
Ah. Good afternoon.
Scrooge and Marley's, I believe?

83
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:53,754
Ah...

84
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:59,384
Have I the pleasure of addressing
Mr Scrooge or Mr Marley?

85
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:02,137
Mr Marley has been dead
these seven years.

86
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:07,100
He died seven years ago...
this very night.

87
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,394
Oh...

88
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:11,897
Well, we have no doubt
that his generosity

89
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,650
is well represented
by his surviving partner.

90
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:19,238
At this festive season
of the year, Mr Scrooge,

91
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:23,909
it is more than usually desirable that
we should make some slight provision

92
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,328
for the poor and the destitute.

93
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:30,666
Many thousands are in want
of common comfort, sir.

94
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,632
Are there no prisons?

95
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:45,931
Prisons? Yes, yes, plenty of prisons.

96
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:51,520
And the union workhouses,
are they still in operation?

97
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,941
They are. I wish
I could say they were not.

98
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,235
The treadmill in full vigour?

99
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,989
- Very busy, sir.
- Good!

100
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:06,243
I was afraid something had occurred
to stop them in their useful course.

101
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:14,126
Yes. At this festive season, a few
of us are endeavouring to raise a fund

102
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:18,630
to buy the poor some meat
and drink and means of warmth.

103
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:20,841
What shall we put you down for?

104
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:25,887
- Nothing.
- Oh, you wish to remain anonymous?

105
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:29,766
I wish to be left alone!
I don't make merry myself at Christmas,

106
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:32,894
and I can't afford
to make idle people merry.

107
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,523
I support the establishments
I have mentioned.

108
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:39,568
And those who are badly off
must go there.

109
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:44,740
Many cannot go there.

110
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:49,578
And, well, frankly,
many would rather die.

111
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:53,707
Then they had better do it
and decrease the surplus population.

112
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:00,297
Good afternoon, gentlemen!

113
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:02,466
Good afternoon.

114
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:22,152
You'll want all day tomorrow, I suppose?

115
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,197
Well, if quite convenient, sir.

116
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,450
It's not convenient, and it's not fair.

117
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:32,537
If I were to dock you a half a crown
for it, you'd think yourself ill-used.

118
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:37,334
And yet you don't think me ill-used
when I pay a day's wages for no work.

119
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:41,380
Well, it's only once a year, sir.

120
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:45,133
Poor excuse for picking a man's pocket
every 25th of December.

121
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:51,515
But I suppose you
must have the whole day.

122
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:54,309
Be here all the earlier
the next morning.

123
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,228
Sir.

124
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,610
Whoa!

125
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:52,617
In honour of Christmas Eve!

126
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:57,122
Whoa!

127
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:03,021
Bugger it!

128
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,618
Where are you? Here!

129
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:21,373
Why does everything
seem to happen to me?

130
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:47,566
Ah!

131
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:53,196
Get away! Get away!

132
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:15,302
Ha! Balderdash!

133
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:10,458
I have given myself the willies.

134
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:13,461
That's what it is.

135
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:43,444
It's all still a hum... Ah!

136
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:49,325
Oh!

137
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:18,479
How now!

138
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:20,899
What do you want with me?

139
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:24,694
Oh, much.

140
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:32,035
- Who are you?
- Ask me who I was.

141
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,703
Who were you then?

142
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,707
In life, I was your partner,

143
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:41,002
Jacob Marley.

144
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,800
Can you sit down?

145
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:51,888
- I can.
- Do it then.

146
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:06,945
You do not believe in me.

147
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:10,907
I don't.

148
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:14,118
Why do you doubt your senses?

149
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:16,955
Because the littlest thing
can affect them.

150
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,583
A slight disorder of the stomach
can make them cheat.

151
00:24:20,668 --> 00:24:24,295
You may be an undigested bit of beef.
A blot of mustard.

152
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:28,049
A crumb of cheese.
A fragment of underdone potato.

153
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:31,427
There's more of gravy than of grave
about you, whatever you are.

154
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:39,268
Mercy! Dreadful apparition,
why do you trouble me?

155
00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:43,648
Man of worldly mind,
do you believe in me or not?

156
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,608
I do! I must!

157
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:50,279
Woe! Woe is me!

158
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:53,157
You are fettered in chains. Why?

159
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:57,370
I wear the chain I forged in life.

160
00:24:57,454 --> 00:25:02,542
I made it link by link and yard by yard.

161
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:05,586
Do you recognise its pattern?

162
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:11,342
Can you imagine the weight and length
of the chain you bear?

163
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:15,513
It was as heavy and long
as this seven Christmas Eves ago.

164
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:20,101
Oh, yours is a ponderous chain.

165
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:25,314
Jacob, tell me no more.

166
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:27,483
Speak comfort to me, Jacob.

167
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:34,032
I have none to give.

168
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:41,122
I cannot stay.
I cannot linger anywhere.

169
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:46,294
Mark me, in life, my spirit never walked
beyond our countinghouse,

170
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:51,716
never roved beyond the narrow limits
of our money-changing hole.

171
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,845
Now endless journeys lie before me.

172
00:25:57,222 --> 00:26:01,309
Seven years dead
and travelling all the time?

173
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:06,355
The whole time. No rest, no peace.

174
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:10,735
You must've covered
a lot of ground in seven years.

175
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:20,745
I was blind!
Blind! I could not see my own life!

176
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:26,501
Squandered and misused.
Oh, woe... Oh, woe is me!

177
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:29,253
But you were always
a good man of business!

178
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:33,091
Business!

179
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:46,938
Mankind... was my business.

180
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:50,066
The common welfare was my business.

181
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:54,904
Charity, mercy, forbearance,
and benevolence were all my...

182
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:16,801
Hear me! My time is nearly gone.

183
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:20,513
I will. But don't be hard upon me,
Jacob. Pray.

184
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:22,723
I am here to warn you

185
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:26,519
that you have yet a chance
at a hope of escaping my fate.

186
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:30,398
A chance of my procuring, Ebenezer.

187
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:36,779
You were always a good friend
to me, Jacob. Thank 'ee.

188
00:27:36,864 --> 00:27:40,241
You will be haunted by three spirits.

189
00:27:43,287 --> 00:27:44,871
That's the chance and hope?

190
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,333
- I'd rather not.
- Expect the first

191
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:51,669
tomorrow when the bell tolls one.

192
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:55,923
Couldn't I take them all at once,
and have it over with, Jacob?

193
00:27:57,092 --> 00:28:00,595
Expect the second the next night
at the same hour.

194
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:05,349
And the third upon the next night,

195
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:08,436
when the last stroke of 12

196
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:11,814
has ceased to vibrate.

197
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:23,743
Look to see me no more.

198
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:30,291
Ah!

199
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:39,508
Ah!

200
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:57,818
I'm sorry.

201
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:01,280
I wish I could help you.

202
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,534
Ah!

203
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:10,915
Oh!

204
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,627
Ah!

205
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:54,542
Ah!

206
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:21,819
Are you the spirit whose coming
was foretold to me?

207
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,489
I am.

208
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:41,380
Is it possible that
you might put your cap on?

209
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:49,221
Would you so soon put out,
with your worldly hands,

210
00:30:49,306 --> 00:30:53,434
the light I give?

211
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,519
No, no! No, no! I'm so sorry.

212
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:58,522
I meant nothing by it.
I meant no offence.

213
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:00,775
I just thought I...

214
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:19,585
Who and what are you?

215
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:26,801
I am the Ghost of Christmas Past.

216
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,306
Long past?

217
00:31:32,933 --> 00:31:35,810
Your past.

218
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:39,897
Rise.

219
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:44,318
And walk with me.

220
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:04,296
But I am mortal and liable to fall.

221
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:08,259
Bear but a touch of my hand there...

222
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:14,348
...and you shall be upheld
in more than this.

223
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:27,695
Whoa!

224
00:33:01,438 --> 00:33:02,771
Good heavens.

225
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,774
I was bred in this place.

226
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:09,236
I was a boy here.

227
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:13,532
Your lip... is trembling.

228
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:18,621
And what's that?

229
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:23,876
- On your cheek?
- Nothing.

230
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:26,545
Something in my eye.

231
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:33,385
Do you remember the way?

232
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:36,138
Remember it?

233
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:39,391
I could walk it blindfolded.

234
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:44,396
Giddyup! Giddyup!

235
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:47,983
Oh! Whoa!

236
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:53,781
These are but shadows of things
that have been.

237
00:33:54,616 --> 00:34:00,162
They have no consciousness... of us.

238
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:07,878
I knew them.

239
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:10,881
I know every one of them.

240
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:13,342
They were schoolmates of mine.

241
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:17,721
Let's go on.

242
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:35,072
This...

243
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:37,157
This was my school.

244
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:40,953
This school is not quite deserted.

245
00:34:42,372 --> 00:34:44,290
A solitary child...

246
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:47,710
...neglected by his friends...

247
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:51,964
...is left here still.

248
00:34:52,674 --> 00:34:54,425
I know.

249
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:37,593
Poor boy.

250
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:40,346
Poor, poor boy.

251
00:35:41,723 --> 00:35:47,394
Let's... see another Christmas.

252
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:15,047
Ebenezer!

253
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,340
Ebenezer!

254
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:21,762
Dear, dear brother!
I've come to bring you home!

255
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:25,099
- Home, little Fan?
- Yes, home!

256
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:28,769
Father is so much kinder
than he used to be.

257
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:31,522
He spoke so gently to me one night.

258
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:34,525
I was not afraid to ask him
if you might come home.

259
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,527
And he said yes!

260
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:39,238
And he sent me in a coach to fetch you.

261
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:41,824
And we're to be together
all the Christmas long.

262
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:45,661
And to have the merriest time
in all the world!

263
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:49,748
You're quite a woman, little Fan.

264
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:59,299
- She had a large heart.
- She died a woman.

265
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:02,928
And had, as I think...

266
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:05,806
...children.

267
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:09,309
Yes, one child.

268
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:11,145
True.

269
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:14,481
- Your nephew.
- Yes.

270
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:39,423
Do you know this place?

271
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:43,510
Know it? I was an apprentice here!

272
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,559
Why, it's old Fezziwig.

273
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:54,605
Bless his heart!
It's Fezziwig alive again!

274
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,277
Yo-ho! Ebenezer, come on!

275
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:05,824
Come on! Dick! Come on! It's 6:00.

276
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:07,951
They're going to be here soon.

277
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:14,124
Dick Wilkins. Bless me, yes.
There he is, Dick Wilkins.

278
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:16,084
He was very attached to me, was Dick.

279
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:24,885
Yo-ho, me lads! No more work tonight.
It's Christmas Eve!

280
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,220
Hooray!

281
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,305
Dick, Ebenezer,
let's get cleared away.

282
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:31,683
We want lots of space.
Lots and lots of space.

283
00:38:31,768 --> 00:38:33,560
Hee-hi!

284
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:37,272
Whoa!

285
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,322
Maestro!

286
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:47,908
May I present...?!

287
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:58,627
Whoo!

288
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:12,224
Whoo!

289
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:28,448
Well done! Well done!

290
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:33,996
And now, kind fiddler, if you please.

291
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:37,749
It is time for Sir Roger de Coverley!

292
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:40,544
Hey!

293
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:57,728
Might I have this dance with you?

294
00:39:57,812 --> 00:40:01,064
Whoo!

295
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:03,233
Ebenezer, it's your pass.

296
00:41:14,764 --> 00:41:17,933
Another idol has replaced me.

297
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:20,727
Another idol?
What idol?

298
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,730
A golden one.

299
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:28,986
There is nothing on this earth
more terrifying to me

300
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:32,364
than a life doomed to poverty.

301
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:35,283
May I ask, why do you condemn,
with such severity,

302
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:38,370
the honest pursuit of substance?

303
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:42,332
You fear the world too much, Ebenezer.

304
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:46,837
- You've changed.
- Changed?

305
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:51,008
Perhaps grown wiser,
but I have not changed toward you.

306
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:53,010
Our contract is an old one.

307
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:56,972
It was made when we were
both poor and content to be so.

308
00:41:58,016 --> 00:42:00,058
When it was made...

309
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:05,731
- You were another man.
- I was a boy!

310
00:42:11,446 --> 00:42:13,447
I release you, Ebenezer.

311
00:42:16,284 --> 00:42:18,869
Have I ever sought release?

312
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:22,456
- In words, no.
- In what, then?

313
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:25,500
In an altered spirit.

314
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:28,670
In another atmosphere of life.

315
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:34,134
In everything that made my love
of any worth in your sight.

316
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:39,806
Tell me, Ebenezer, if this contract
had never been between us,

317
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:41,767
would you seek me out now?

318
00:42:44,604 --> 00:42:45,937
No.

319
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:50,567
You think not?

320
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:54,780
I would gladly think otherwise
if I could.

321
00:42:56,783 --> 00:43:01,328
But if you were free today,
would you choose a dowerless girl?

322
00:43:02,038 --> 00:43:04,998
A girl left penniless
by the death of her parents?

323
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:08,752
You, who weighs everything by gain?

324
00:43:13,216 --> 00:43:15,509
I release you, Ebenezer.

325
00:43:16,886 --> 00:43:19,846
May you be happy in the life
you've chosen.

326
00:43:25,895 --> 00:43:29,189
Spirit, remove me from this place.

327
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:32,526
I told you, these were shadows
of things that have been.

328
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:36,488
They are what they are.
Do not blame me.

329
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:39,241
Remove me. I cannot bear it.

330
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:55,298
Leave me! Take me back!

331
00:43:56,217 --> 00:43:58,093
Haunt me no longer!

332
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:29,666
Ah! Oh!

333
00:44:49,896 --> 00:44:52,230
Ah! Ah!

334
00:44:56,736 --> 00:44:59,362
Oh, blast!

335
00:45:31,312 --> 00:45:33,521
Enter, Scrooge!

336
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:14,229
Come in! Come in
and know me better, man!

337
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:24,197
I am the Ghost of Christmas Present.

338
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:28,952
Look upon me!

339
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:40,714
You have never seen
the likes of me before?

340
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:45,677
Never.

341
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:49,889
Have never walked forth
with my elder brothers?

342
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,727
I don't think that I have.

343
00:46:54,729 --> 00:46:57,856
You have many brothers?

344
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:08,366
More than 1,800.

345
00:47:08,701 --> 00:47:13,705
1,842, to be exact.

346
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:17,667
Oh.

347
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:24,632
I see you wear a scabbard, but no sword.

348
00:47:27,887 --> 00:47:29,429
Indeed.

349
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:35,769
Peace on Earth. Goodwill toward men.

350
00:47:39,607 --> 00:47:43,693
Spirit, conduct me where you will.

351
00:47:54,497 --> 00:47:56,498
Oh...

352
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:04,214
Touch my robe.

353
00:48:51,804 --> 00:48:56,057
Oh! What's happening?
What are you doing?

354
00:48:56,142 --> 00:48:59,561
Ah!

355
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:24,752
Oh!

356
00:49:26,547 --> 00:49:28,506
Very strange.

357
00:49:28,591 --> 00:49:33,094
Indeed. Not many mortals are granted

358
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:37,515
- a heavenly perspective of man's world.
- Yes.

359
00:50:24,897 --> 00:50:28,608
It's quite beautiful.

360
00:50:53,092 --> 00:50:56,719
Spirit, these poor people
have no means to cook their food.

361
00:50:56,804 --> 00:50:58,555
And yet you seek
to close the only places

362
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:02,517
in which they can warm
their meagre meals every seventh day.

363
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:05,019
Oh!

364
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:11,859
Hear me, Scrooge.

365
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:17,740
There are some upon this earth of yours

366
00:51:17,825 --> 00:51:20,827
who claim to know me and my brothers,

367
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:25,540
and do their deeds of ill will
and selfishness in our name.

368
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:29,043
These so-called "men of the cloth"

369
00:51:29,128 --> 00:51:34,424
are as strange to me and my kin
as if they never lived.

370
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:38,219
Charge their doings to them, not us.

371
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:42,557
Aye. I will.

372
00:51:47,021 --> 00:51:48,354
Smell that?

373
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:51,065
Cooking goose!

374
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:53,276
Come on!

375
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:19,927
I take it this bleak paupers'
dwelling is of some significance.

376
00:52:20,012 --> 00:52:23,056
It is all your loyal clerk can afford

377
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:25,391
for his meagre 15 bob a week.

378
00:52:25,476 --> 00:52:27,143
- Mother!
- Papa!

379
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:28,936
We just came by the baker shop.

380
00:52:29,021 --> 00:52:31,481
And smelled our goose,
cooking delicious.

381
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:35,318
Shut the door, please. What
happened to your precious father?

382
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:39,864
And your brother. And Martha,
she wasn't as late last Christmas Day.

383
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:42,033
Mother, here she is, Mother.
Here's Martha.

384
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:45,703
Martha! Wait till you see
our goose. 'Tis a wonderful one.

385
00:52:45,788 --> 00:52:48,081
Peter, off with you
to the baker's and collect the bird.

386
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:51,793
And take the children with you.
And pray, no dallying.

387
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:55,380
Why, bless your heart alive!
Dear, how late you are!

388
00:52:55,464 --> 00:52:59,425
We had a deal of work to finish up last
night and clear away this morning.

389
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:03,221
Never mind. Long as you're here. Sit ye
down before the fire and have a warm.

390
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:05,682
No. No, no, no. There's Father coming.

391
00:53:05,766 --> 00:53:09,268
Hide, Martha.
You must hide. Hide, Martha.

392
00:53:16,402 --> 00:53:22,407
- It's cold out there.
- Hello, Father. Hello, Timmy.

393
00:53:27,413 --> 00:53:31,582
- Why, where's our Martha?
- Uh... Not coming.

394
00:53:33,085 --> 00:53:37,296
Not coming?
Not coming upon Christmas Day?

395
00:53:38,799 --> 00:53:41,217
Here I am, Father!

396
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:43,052
We got you, Father.

397
00:53:43,137 --> 00:53:47,098
I couldn't bear to see you in a state
of disappointment. If only for a giggle.

398
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:49,892
It's so lovely to see you, my Martha.

399
00:53:49,977 --> 00:53:52,645
Come on, Timmy. I hear
the pudding singing in the copper.

400
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:54,439
Shall we have a look, then?

401
00:53:55,357 --> 00:54:00,319
- How did little Timmy behave?
- As good as gold. And better.

402
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:04,031
Somehow he gets thoughtful
sitting by himself so much,

403
00:54:04,116 --> 00:54:06,909
and he thinks the strangest things
you ever heard.

404
00:54:06,994 --> 00:54:10,371
He told me, coming home, that he hoped
the people sawed him in church,

405
00:54:10,539 --> 00:54:12,123
because he was a cripple...

406
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:17,462
...and it might make pleasant for them
to remember it upon Christmas Day

407
00:54:17,546 --> 00:54:20,173
who made lame beggars walk
and blind men see.

408
00:54:24,178 --> 00:54:29,390
I believe he grows more hearty
and stronger every day, my dear.

409
00:54:37,858 --> 00:54:39,817
The pudding looks delicious!

410
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:43,863
The whole wash house smells
like a pastry cook's shop.

411
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:50,912
Spirit, tell me, will Tiny Tim...?

412
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:56,459
I see a vacant seat
in the poor chimney corner...

413
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:01,172
...and a crutch without an owner.

414
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:07,053
Carefully preserved.

415
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:12,975
- Hurrah!
- The Christmas goose!

416
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:16,979
Make space.
Let's get that cover off.

417
00:55:17,064 --> 00:55:19,774
- Oh!
- Lovely! Well done, Peter.

418
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:22,985
I don't believe I've ever seen
a more magnificent goose cooked.

419
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:25,530
It is a beautiful bird, that's for sure.

420
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:29,909
But I'll pray that
one Christmas, perhaps,

421
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:31,828
the children might taste a turkey.

422
00:55:31,912 --> 00:55:34,622
Perhaps one day, my dear.
Perhaps one day.

423
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:37,458
A toast.

424
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:42,380
To Mr Scrooge.

425
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:46,676
- The founder of our feast.
- Ha!

426
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:50,263
Founder of the feast, indeed.
I wish I had him here.

427
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:52,306
I'd give him a piece of
my mind to feast upon,

428
00:55:52,391 --> 00:55:54,684
and I'd hope he'd have
a good appetite for it.

429
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:58,437
My dear, the children...
It's Christmas Day.

430
00:55:58,522 --> 00:56:00,648
Christmas Day, I'm sure.
How can one drink the health

431
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:04,986
of such an odious, stingy, hard,
unfeeling man as Mr Scrooge?

432
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:09,198
As you know he is, Robert.
Nobody knows it better than you.

433
00:56:09,283 --> 00:56:11,909
My dear, Christmas Day.

434
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:16,581
I'll drink his health for your sake
and the day's, not for his.

435
00:56:19,001 --> 00:56:21,252
A merry Christmas
and a happy New Year.

436
00:56:22,421 --> 00:56:24,881
He'll be very merry and very happy,
I have no doubt.

437
00:56:26,008 --> 00:56:30,595
A merry Christmas to us all,
my dears. God bless us.

438
00:56:30,679 --> 00:56:32,513
God bless us.

439
00:56:32,598 --> 00:56:36,559
God bless us, everyone.

440
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:39,145
- Merry Christmas and happy New Year.
- God bless.

441
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:44,734
Kind spirit,
say Tiny Tim will be spared.

442
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:47,737
If these shadows remain unaltered

443
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:52,241
by the future... the child will die.

444
00:56:52,326 --> 00:56:55,036
Die! No, spirit. No.

445
00:56:57,414 --> 00:57:01,876
What then?
If he is to die, he had better do it.

446
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:06,505
And decrease
the surplus population.

447
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:31,322
- So you're thinking of an animal?
- Yes.

448
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:33,324
- A live animal?
- Yes.

449
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:35,785
- A rather disagreeable animal?
- Yes.

450
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:37,161
- A savage animal?
- Yes.

451
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:40,122
Wait, wait! Is it an animal
that grunts and growls?

452
00:57:40,207 --> 00:57:41,457
Yes!

453
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:43,292
- And lives in London?
- Yes.

454
00:57:43,377 --> 00:57:44,460
- A horse?
- No.

455
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:45,544
- A cow?
- No.

456
00:57:45,629 --> 00:57:47,046
- A dog?
- A pig?

457
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:48,673
- No.
- An ass?

458
00:57:49,967 --> 00:57:52,426
- Yes and no.
- Oh!

459
00:57:52,511 --> 00:57:56,138
I know who it is, Fred!
I know! It's your Uncle Scrooge!

460
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:58,849
Yes!

461
00:58:06,191 --> 00:58:09,318
Christmas a humbug?
Now, he actually said that?

462
00:58:09,403 --> 00:58:12,655
As I live. And he believes it.

463
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:14,949
I have no patience
with him, Fred.

464
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:17,827
I have. I'm sorry for him.

465
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:21,497
Who suffers from his ill whims?
Only himself.

466
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:25,126
He decides to dislike us,
won't come and dine with us,

467
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:27,670
and what's the consequence?
He loses a dinner.

468
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:30,339
- Indeed, he loses a very good dinner.
- Hear, hear.

469
00:58:30,424 --> 00:58:33,551
- A magnificent dinner.
- Great.

470
00:58:34,094 --> 00:58:36,721
He's certainly given us
plenty of merriment, that's for sure,

471
00:58:36,805 --> 00:58:39,598
and I think it would be ungrateful
not to drink to his health.

472
00:58:39,683 --> 00:58:42,685
He wouldn't take it from me,
but he may have it nevertheless.

473
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:46,647
A merry Christmas to the old man,
whatever he is. Uncle Scrooge.

474
00:58:46,732 --> 00:58:50,151
To Uncle Scrooge.

475
00:59:02,706 --> 00:59:05,374
Are spirits' lives so short?

476
00:59:05,459 --> 00:59:09,962
My life upon this globe is very brief.

477
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:13,716
It ends tonight.

478
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:18,220
- Tonight?
- Tonight at midnight.

479
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:25,686
Hark.
The time is drawing near.

480
00:59:34,905 --> 00:59:40,076
Forgive me... but I see something
strange protruding from your skirt.

481
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:42,953
Is it a foot or a claw?

482
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:48,709
It might be a claw, for the scant amount
of flesh there is upon it.

483
00:59:51,505 --> 00:59:55,508
- Look here.
- Naff off!

484
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:58,636
Oh, man. Look here.

485
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,262
You daft old geezer.

486
01:00:00,347 --> 01:00:03,682
Look! Look!

487
01:00:04,351 --> 01:00:07,144
Down here!

488
01:00:09,815 --> 01:00:13,192
- Go away!
- Are they yours?

489
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:15,694
They are man's.

490
01:00:16,905 --> 01:00:19,990
This boy is Ignorance.

491
01:00:20,075 --> 01:00:22,284
This girl is Want.

492
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:26,038
Beware them both.

493
01:00:26,832 --> 01:00:29,125
Oh!

494
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:31,293
Ah!

495
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:36,048
Ah!

496
01:00:46,393 --> 01:00:48,978
Have they no refuge? No resource?

497
01:00:50,397 --> 01:00:52,148
Are there no prisons?

498
01:00:57,028 --> 01:01:00,948
Are there no workhouses?

499
01:02:08,892 --> 01:02:12,728
Am I in the presence of
the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come?

500
01:02:15,941 --> 01:02:17,358
You're about to show me shadows

501
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:21,237
of the things that have not happened
but will happen. Is that so, spirit?

502
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:27,201
Ghost of the Future, I fear you
more than any spectre I have seen.

503
01:02:27,285 --> 01:02:29,828
But I know your purpose
is to do me good.

504
01:02:30,664 --> 01:02:33,499
I am prepared to bear you company.

505
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:34,625
Lead on.

506
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:43,592
The night is waning fast.
It's precious time to me.

507
01:02:43,677 --> 01:02:44,677
Lead on, spirit.

508
01:02:58,275 --> 01:03:01,360
- When did he die?
- Last night, I believe.

509
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:04,363
- Or sometime Christmas Day.
- I thought he'd never die.

510
01:03:05,115 --> 01:03:08,701
- What's he done with his money?
- Hasn't left it to me.

511
01:03:09,369 --> 01:03:11,912
That's all I know.

512
01:03:11,997 --> 01:03:14,915
It is likely to be a cheap funeral.

513
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,960
For the life of me, I can't think
of anyone who'd want to attend it.

514
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:22,506
I don't mind going...
if lunch is provided.

515
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:24,883
There, yes.

516
01:03:24,968 --> 01:03:26,427
What a frightful fellow.

517
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:28,929
- All right.
- Good day, gentlemen.

518
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:39,732
Get ahold of yourself, Ebenezer.
You're having a wobbly.

519
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:36,765
Whoo!

520
01:05:43,982 --> 01:05:45,691
Oh! Oh!

521
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:32,070
You won't get me in here.

522
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:39,495
Christmas pudding, no doubt.

523
01:07:01,309 --> 01:07:03,435
I'm... I'm on Lime Street.

524
01:07:10,068 --> 01:07:11,902
Oh, come now.

525
01:08:12,547 --> 01:08:13,964
Oh!

526
01:08:16,259 --> 01:08:17,843
Ah!

527
01:08:24,809 --> 01:08:26,810
Whoa!

528
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:44,620
Merry Christmas, Joe.

529
01:08:44,704 --> 01:08:47,497
And happy New Year,
to be sure. Come in.

530
01:08:49,292 --> 01:08:52,377
Sit down in me parlour
and let's have a look.

531
01:08:58,343 --> 01:08:59,593
Here.

532
01:09:01,596 --> 01:09:02,638
Whoa!

533
01:09:02,722 --> 01:09:04,806
What do you call these,
Mrs Dilber, huh?

534
01:09:04,891 --> 01:09:06,558
Mrs Dilber?

535
01:09:08,186 --> 01:09:11,605
Bed curtains.

536
01:09:11,689 --> 01:09:14,733
You mean to say you took them down
while he was lying there?

537
01:09:15,610 --> 01:09:17,527
I do.

538
01:09:17,612 --> 01:09:20,072
And why not?

539
01:09:21,574 --> 01:09:25,243
You was born to make your fortune,
and you certainly will do it.

540
01:09:25,328 --> 01:09:27,537
Well,
I shan't hold back my hand

541
01:09:27,622 --> 01:09:29,164
when I can get something by it...

542
01:09:29,248 --> 01:09:31,708
Don't you go getting grease
on them blankets now.

543
01:09:31,876 --> 01:09:35,754
- His blankets?
- Whose else do you think?

544
01:09:36,506 --> 01:09:40,467
He won't be feeling the cold
without them now, I dare say.

545
01:09:40,551 --> 01:09:42,844
I hope he didn't die
of anything catching.

546
01:09:42,929 --> 01:09:45,055
Don't you
be afeard of that.

547
01:09:45,723 --> 01:09:49,267
I ain't so fond of his company
that I'd loiter about.

548
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:57,484
You can look through that shirt
till your eyes ache,

549
01:09:57,568 --> 01:09:59,945
and you won't find one hole in it.

550
01:10:01,447 --> 01:10:03,615
- It was the best he had.
- Mrs Dilber!

551
01:10:04,367 --> 01:10:06,284
Would have been wasted,
only for me.

552
01:10:06,369 --> 01:10:10,872
- You're fired! Fired!
- How did you mean "wasted"?

553
01:10:10,957 --> 01:10:16,712
Somebody was fool enough
to put it on him to be buried in.

554
01:10:16,796 --> 01:10:20,424
But I took it off him.

555
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:26,638
This is the end of it, you see.

556
01:10:27,473 --> 01:10:30,809
He frightened everyone away
while he was alive.

557
01:10:32,103 --> 01:10:35,147
Only to profit us now that he's dead.

558
01:10:36,023 --> 01:10:41,069
If he'd had somebody to look after him
when he was struck with death,

559
01:10:41,154 --> 01:10:46,616
instead of lying there, all alone,
gasping out his last breath...

560
01:10:46,701 --> 01:10:49,578
...well, we wouldn't have
these things to sell now, would we?

561
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:54,958
Hey!

562
01:11:04,844 --> 01:11:07,095
Whoa!

563
01:11:16,522 --> 01:11:18,899
Spirit! I see! I see!

564
01:11:20,193 --> 01:11:23,278
The case of this unhappy
man who dies a solitary, lonesome death

565
01:11:23,362 --> 01:11:25,071
might be my own.

566
01:11:25,156 --> 01:11:27,157
My life
tends that way now.

567
01:11:45,176 --> 01:11:47,093
Merciful heavens! What's this?

568
01:11:52,099 --> 01:11:55,060
Spirit, this is a fearful place.

569
01:11:55,895 --> 01:11:59,731
When I leave it, I shall not leave
its lesson. Trust me. Let's go!

570
01:12:13,579 --> 01:12:17,582
I understand. And I would, if I could,
but I have not the power.

571
01:12:30,596 --> 01:12:35,767
Spirit, if there is any person who feels
emotion caused by this man's death,

572
01:12:35,935 --> 01:12:38,270
show that person to me, I beg you.

573
01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:54,703
- Are we ruined?
- There is hope yet.

574
01:12:55,454 --> 01:12:58,540
Hope? Only if he relents.

575
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:01,459
He is past relenting.

576
01:13:03,629 --> 01:13:05,130
He is dead.

577
01:13:05,965 --> 01:13:07,215
Dead?

578
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:13,513
To whom will our debts be transferred?

579
01:13:13,598 --> 01:13:15,140
I don't know, but by then
we'll have the money.

580
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:19,311
And even if we don't, it's unlikely any
new creditor will ever be so merciless.

581
01:13:21,105 --> 01:13:23,815
We shall sleep tonight
with light hearts, my dear.

582
01:13:24,817 --> 01:13:27,444
Let me see some tenderness
connected to death,

583
01:13:27,528 --> 01:13:29,988
or this chamber will forever haunt me!

584
01:13:43,336 --> 01:13:44,502
It's late.

585
01:13:45,838 --> 01:13:47,589
Past your father's time.

586
01:13:49,926 --> 01:13:53,178
He's walked slow
these last few evenings.

587
01:13:54,138 --> 01:13:55,680
Oh, he has walked...

588
01:13:56,766 --> 01:14:00,936
...with Tiny Tim on his shoulders...
fast, indeed.

589
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:05,482
But he was very light...

590
01:14:06,817 --> 01:14:08,318
...to carry, and...

591
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:13,490
...your father loved him so.

592
01:14:23,084 --> 01:14:26,252
- Father.
- You went today, then?

593
01:14:28,422 --> 01:14:29,756
Yes, my dear.

594
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:32,008
I wish you could have gone.

595
01:14:33,135 --> 01:14:35,804
Would have done you good
to see how green a place it is.

596
01:14:37,348 --> 01:14:38,682
You'll see it often.

597
01:14:39,892 --> 01:14:45,647
And I promised him I would walk there
every...  every Sunday.

598
01:14:47,066 --> 01:14:49,442
My little child!

599
01:14:51,112 --> 01:14:53,029
My little child.

600
01:14:53,239 --> 01:14:57,659
Father, please don't be grieved.
Please, Father.

601
01:14:57,743 --> 01:15:00,495
I'm all right, love.
I'm quite at peace.

602
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:06,876
I'm sure none of us will
ever forget our poor Tiny Tim.

603
01:15:06,961 --> 01:15:09,671
- Oh, no, Father.
- Never ever.

604
01:15:10,506 --> 01:15:11,673
Thank you.

605
01:15:13,259 --> 01:15:14,592
Thank you, my dears.

606
01:15:41,078 --> 01:15:42,287
Bob.

607
01:16:08,939 --> 01:16:14,778
Spectre... something tells me
our parting moment is at hand.

608
01:16:16,197 --> 01:16:17,447
Tell me...

609
01:16:18,365 --> 01:16:23,661
...who... was that man
we saw lying dead?

610
01:16:57,363 --> 01:16:58,446
Spirit...

611
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:05,954
...before I draw nearer
to that stone to which you point,

612
01:17:06,038 --> 01:17:07,539
answer me one question!

613
01:17:08,541 --> 01:17:11,084
Are these the shadows
of things that will be

614
01:17:11,168 --> 01:17:13,211
or shadows of things that may be?

615
01:17:13,879 --> 01:17:16,965
Men's courses in life
foreshadow certain ends.

616
01:17:17,049 --> 01:17:21,261
But if these courses are departed from,
these ends will change. Isn't that so?

617
01:17:22,596 --> 01:17:27,142
No. No!

618
01:17:27,226 --> 01:17:30,562
Am I that man who lay upon the bed?

619
01:17:32,690 --> 01:17:37,193
No. Spirit, hear me!

620
01:17:37,278 --> 01:17:39,654
I'm not the man I was!

621
01:17:39,738 --> 01:17:42,574
Why show me this if I'm past all hope?

622
01:17:43,826 --> 01:17:44,909
Spirit!

623
01:17:45,494 --> 01:17:48,663
Spirit, assure me that I may change
these shadows you've shown me!

624
01:17:48,747 --> 01:17:50,957
Change them by an altered life!

625
01:17:54,378 --> 01:17:57,630
No, spirit! No! No, spirit!

626
01:18:05,723 --> 01:18:08,433
Good spirit... help me!

627
01:18:09,643 --> 01:18:12,061
Spirit!

628
01:18:13,272 --> 01:18:15,106
Help me, spirit!

629
01:18:30,164 --> 01:18:33,291
Ah!

630
01:18:38,964 --> 01:18:40,757
Help, spirit!

631
01:18:52,186 --> 01:18:56,856
Spirit, I will honour Christmas in my
heart and try to keep it all the year.

632
01:18:56,941 --> 01:19:00,401
I will not shut out the lessons
of the past, nor present, nor future.

633
01:19:00,486 --> 01:19:02,612
Oh, please, spirit,

634
01:19:02,696 --> 01:19:07,575
tell me I may sponge away
the writing on that stone!

635
01:20:00,379 --> 01:20:01,462
Still here?

636
01:20:03,465 --> 01:20:06,676
They're still here.

637
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:07,802
I'm still here.

638
01:20:07,886 --> 01:20:10,888
I'm still here.

639
01:20:13,225 --> 01:20:15,393
I'm still here!

640
01:20:19,732 --> 01:20:20,898
I don't know what to do.

641
01:20:20,983 --> 01:20:24,736
I'm light as a feather,
merry as a schoolboy.

642
01:20:27,406 --> 01:20:29,032
I've heard that laugh before.

643
01:20:33,245 --> 01:20:35,204
Ah!

644
01:20:37,541 --> 01:20:40,501
- I say, what's today?
- Eh?

645
01:20:41,253 --> 01:20:45,840
- What's today, my fine fellow?
- Today? Why, Christmas Day.

646
01:20:46,467 --> 01:20:49,677
It's Christmas Day?
I haven't missed it.

647
01:20:49,762 --> 01:20:51,721
The spirits have
done it all in one night.

648
01:20:51,805 --> 01:20:55,016
They can do anything they like.
Of course they can. Of course they can.

649
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:58,311
Hello, my fine fellow. Do you know
the poulterer's on the corner?

650
01:20:58,395 --> 01:21:01,689
- I should hope I did.
- What an intelligent boy.

651
01:21:01,774 --> 01:21:04,859
Do you know whether they've sold
the prize turkey that was hanging there?

652
01:21:04,943 --> 01:21:07,695
Not the little prize turkey,
the big one.

653
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:11,532
- The one as big as me?
- What a delightful child.

654
01:21:13,452 --> 01:21:17,038
- Yes, my buck.
- It's hanging there now.

655
01:21:17,122 --> 01:21:19,916
Is it? Go and buy it, then!

656
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,252
- Walker!
- No, no, I'm in earnest.

657
01:21:23,337 --> 01:21:26,672
Go and buy it, bring it back here,
and I'll give you a shilling.

658
01:21:26,757 --> 01:21:29,634
Come back in less than five minutes,
and I'll give you a half a crown.

659
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:35,014
I'll send it to Bob Cratchit's.
He shan't know who sent it.

660
01:21:35,099 --> 01:21:37,600
It's twice the size of Tiny Tim.

661
01:21:41,313 --> 01:21:42,480
Mrs Dilber.

662
01:21:43,941 --> 01:21:45,817
Merry Christmas!

663
01:21:47,027 --> 01:21:50,071
Oh, my God!

664
01:21:52,282 --> 01:21:54,450
He's gone mad!

665
01:21:55,411 --> 01:21:57,829
Yay!

666
01:21:59,581 --> 01:22:01,082
My dear Mrs Dilber,

667
01:22:01,166 --> 01:22:04,710
you're the loveliest creature
I have ever laid eyes upon.

668
01:22:04,795 --> 01:22:07,463
Dance with me, Mrs Dilber.
Dance with me!

669
01:22:07,548 --> 01:22:11,509
- You're barmy, Mr Scrooge!
- Unhand me!

670
01:22:11,593 --> 01:22:15,513
He's completely deranged! Help!

671
01:22:16,098 --> 01:22:19,183
- What a charming woman.
- Help!

672
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:24,021
I shall love it as long as I live.

673
01:22:24,690 --> 01:22:26,524
What an honest face it has.

674
01:22:26,608 --> 01:22:28,234
Ooh!

675
01:22:28,318 --> 01:22:30,194
Hello. Here's the bird.

676
01:22:32,281 --> 01:22:34,615
Hello! Whoop!

677
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:37,076
How are you? Merry Christmas.

678
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:42,457
Why, it's impossible to carry that
to Camden Town. You must have a cab.

679
01:22:44,626 --> 01:22:46,419
Drive on, my good man!

680
01:22:56,472 --> 01:22:58,931
Hilly-ho! Chirrup!

681
01:23:02,311 --> 01:23:05,563
Yahoo!

682
01:23:07,691 --> 01:23:09,775
Hip, hip! Chirry-up!

683
01:23:09,860 --> 01:23:11,819
Bob's your uncle!
Fanny's your aunt!

684
01:23:11,904 --> 01:23:14,864
Here's your aunt's fanny.

685
01:23:17,159 --> 01:23:19,911
Live it up, folks!
You'll be a long time dead!

686
01:23:19,995 --> 01:23:22,288
Don't let the worms have all the fun.

687
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:31,339
Merry Christmas.

688
01:23:42,601 --> 01:23:44,810
Good morning, sir.
A merry Christmas to you.

689
01:23:44,895 --> 01:23:46,938
- And to you, sir.
- Happy holiday!

690
01:23:47,022 --> 01:23:49,148
And a merry Christmas to you.

691
01:23:49,733 --> 01:23:52,568
- "God bless you, sir."
- Thank you, sir.

692
01:23:53,529 --> 01:23:54,695
Glad tidings.

693
01:23:54,780 --> 01:23:56,447
Sir.

694
01:24:03,455 --> 01:24:07,416
My dear sir, how do you do?
I hope you succeeded yesterday.

695
01:24:07,501 --> 01:24:09,085
A merry Christmas to you, sir.

696
01:24:10,295 --> 01:24:11,796
Mr Scrooge?

697
01:24:12,631 --> 01:24:17,093
Yes. That is my name, and I fear
it may not be pleasant to you.

698
01:24:17,761 --> 01:24:19,887
But allow me to ask your pardon.

699
01:24:20,681 --> 01:24:22,431
And will you have the goodness...

700
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:29,772
Lord bless me!

701
01:24:29,856 --> 01:24:34,569
- My dear Mr Scrooge, are you serious?
- And not a farthing less.

702
01:24:34,653 --> 01:24:37,780
A great many back payments
are included in it, I assure you.

703
01:24:37,864 --> 01:24:40,241
My dear sir, I don't know
what to say to such...

704
01:24:40,325 --> 01:24:44,161
Do not say anything.
I'm much obliged to you.

705
01:24:44,246 --> 01:24:46,789
Many thanks to you. And bless you.

706
01:25:36,673 --> 01:25:39,050
- Is your master at home?
- Yes, sir.

707
01:25:40,636 --> 01:25:42,970
I'm... his uncle.

708
01:25:53,732 --> 01:25:56,067
Is it an animal
that grunts and growls?

709
01:25:56,151 --> 01:25:57,151
Yes.

710
01:25:57,235 --> 01:25:58,694
- And lives in London?
- Yes.

711
01:25:58,779 --> 01:25:59,779
- A horse?
- No.

712
01:25:59,863 --> 01:26:00,863
- A cow?
- No.

713
01:26:01,031 --> 01:26:02,031
A dog.

714
01:26:02,115 --> 01:26:03,157
- A pig.
- No.

715
01:26:03,241 --> 01:26:04,283
An ass.

716
01:26:05,619 --> 01:26:07,078
Yes and no.

717
01:26:08,413 --> 01:26:10,456
- I know what it is, Fred! I know!
- What?

718
01:26:10,540 --> 01:26:12,249
It's your...

719
01:26:13,585 --> 01:26:14,919
Uncle Scrooge?

720
01:26:16,296 --> 01:26:17,797
Well, bless my soul.

721
01:26:21,259 --> 01:26:24,303
I've... come to dinner...

722
01:26:26,848 --> 01:26:28,516
...if you'll have me.

723
01:26:33,730 --> 01:26:36,190
Of course, Uncle! Welcome! Welcome!

724
01:26:36,274 --> 01:26:39,318
Merry Christmas!
Everybody, this is my uncle, Ebenezer.

725
01:26:46,618 --> 01:26:48,160
Be good and pass this.

726
01:26:48,995 --> 01:26:52,039
Here you go. Enjoy.

727
01:26:52,124 --> 01:26:55,209
Next year we must have
this dinner at my house.

728
01:26:55,293 --> 01:26:56,711
I insist.

729
01:26:57,713 --> 01:27:01,382
I'll spare no expense. After all,
you can't take it with you, can you?

730
01:27:01,466 --> 01:27:04,135
No, you can't.

731
01:27:32,914 --> 01:27:36,834
A full 16 minutes late.

732
01:27:40,672 --> 01:27:43,883
What do you mean by
coming here at this time of day?

733
01:27:43,967 --> 01:27:48,387
I'm very sorry, sir.
I am a bit behind in my time.

734
01:27:48,472 --> 01:27:50,473
You are, indeed.

735
01:27:52,017 --> 01:27:53,976
Step in here.

736
01:27:57,189 --> 01:27:58,814
Well, it's only once a year, sir.

737
01:27:58,899 --> 01:28:02,401
It shall not be repeated.
I was making rather merry yesterday.

738
01:28:02,527 --> 01:28:05,321
Now, I'll tell you what, Mr Cratchit.

739
01:28:05,405 --> 01:28:08,866
I'm not going to stand
for this sort of thing any longer.

740
01:28:08,950 --> 01:28:10,284
And therefore...

741
01:28:11,536 --> 01:28:13,746
And therefore...

742
01:28:13,830 --> 01:28:17,082
...I am about to raise your salary!

743
01:28:24,883 --> 01:28:26,342
A merry Christmas to you, Bob.

744
01:28:28,970 --> 01:28:32,640
A merrier Christmas, Bob,
my good fellow,

745
01:28:32,724 --> 01:28:35,351
than I've given you in many a year.

746
01:28:35,435 --> 01:28:39,647
I'll raise your salary, and do whatever
I can to help your struggling family.

747
01:28:39,731 --> 01:28:41,190
And we'll discuss your affairs

748
01:28:41,274 --> 01:28:44,318
this very afternoon
over a bowl of Christmas punch.

749
01:28:44,402 --> 01:28:47,154
But first, let's make up the fires.

750
01:28:47,239 --> 01:28:48,739
I want you to go out...

751
01:28:49,991 --> 01:28:52,117
...and buy another scuttle of coal

752
01:28:52,285 --> 01:28:54,745
before you dot another "I,"
Bob Cratchit.

753
01:28:55,956 --> 01:28:57,748
Off with you, Bob.

754
01:28:57,833 --> 01:29:00,501
We've wassailing to do.

755
01:29:00,877 --> 01:29:02,294
Hilly-ho, Bob!

756
01:29:02,379 --> 01:29:05,381
Yeah. Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

757
01:29:26,820 --> 01:29:29,238
And Scrooge was better than his word.

758
01:29:29,322 --> 01:29:31,991
He did all that he said he would
and more.

759
01:29:32,868 --> 01:29:38,205
And to our Tiny Tim, who got well,
Scrooge was like a second father.

760
01:29:38,290 --> 01:29:41,333
He became as good a friend,
as good a master

761
01:29:41,418 --> 01:29:43,961
and as good a man
as the good old city ever knew.

762
01:29:44,921 --> 01:29:48,924
And it was always said of him
that he knew how to keep Christmas well.

763
01:29:50,552 --> 01:29:54,263
And so, as Tiny Tim observed...

764
01:29:54,347 --> 01:29:57,016
God bless us, everyone.

765
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:01,126
