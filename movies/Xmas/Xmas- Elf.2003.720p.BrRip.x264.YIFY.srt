1
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,593
<i>Oh, hello.</i>

2
00:00:29,628 --> 00:00:31,530
<i>You're, uh, you're probably here</i>

3
00:00:31,565 --> 00:00:34,020
<i>about the, uh, the story.</i>

4
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,140
Elves love to tell stories.

5
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,537
I-I'll bet you didn't know that
about elves.

6
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:40,856
There's, uh, probably a lot of things

7
00:00:40,891 --> 00:00:43,105
you... you didn't know about elves.

8
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:47,810
Another... another interesting,
uh, elf-ism:

9
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:53,250
uh, there are only three jobs available
to an elf.

10
00:00:53,285 --> 00:00:54,902
The first is making shoes at night

11
00:00:54,937 --> 00:00:56,520
while, you know, while the old...

12
00:00:56,555 --> 00:00:58,015
the old cobbler sleeps.

13
00:00:58,189 --> 00:01:01,225
Lazy bum. Couldn't even make a clog.

14
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,873
<i>- You can bake cookies in a tree.</i>
- Hey!

15
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,796
<i>As you can imagine, it's, uh, dangerous
having an oven</i>

16
00:01:06,831 --> 00:01:09,265
<i>in an oak tree during the dry season.</i>

17
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,999
I wanna make shoes!

18
00:01:11,034 --> 00:01:13,570
<i>But the third job... uh, some call
it, uh...</i>

19
00:01:13,605 --> 00:01:16,412
<i>"the show", or the "big dance".</i>

20
00:01:16,472 --> 00:01:19,959
<i>It's the profession that every elf
aspires to,</i>

21
00:01:19,994 --> 00:01:24,080
<i>and that is to build toys in
Santa's workshop.</i>

22
00:01:24,115 --> 00:01:26,310
- Only two weeks left till Christmas!
- Yay!

23
00:01:27,023 --> 00:01:29,818
<i>I-It's a job only an elf can do.</i>

24
00:01:29,853 --> 00:01:33,014
<i>Our... our nimble fingers,
natural cheer and active minds</i>

25
00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:34,722
<i>are perfect for toy-building.</i>

26
00:01:35,156 --> 00:01:37,726
<i>They... they tried using gnomes
and trolls,</i>

27
00:01:37,761 --> 00:01:41,593
<i>but the gnomes drank too much...</i>

28
00:01:42,364 --> 00:01:45,162
<i>and the trolls weren't toilet trained.</i>

29
00:01:45,401 --> 00:01:50,572
No human being has ever set... set
foot in Santa's workshop.

30
00:01:50,607 --> 00:01:53,375
Uh, that is,
until about 30 years ago,

31
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:55,763
and, as you may have guessed,

32
00:01:55,802 --> 00:01:58,719
that's where our story begins.

33
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:32,405
Wow!

34
00:02:35,109 --> 00:02:36,667
Whoa!

35
00:03:13,365 --> 00:03:14,933
Ooh!

36
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:16,325
Wow!

37
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:17,933
Wow!

38
00:03:25,298 --> 00:03:28,563
Ow! Ow!

39
00:03:43,246 --> 00:03:44,645
Whoa!

40
00:03:47,784 --> 00:03:49,979
Are you sleepy?

41
00:03:51,021 --> 00:03:51,753
Here we are.

42
00:03:51,788 --> 00:03:56,127
We're just going to make you feel
so comfortable.

43
00:03:56,167 --> 00:03:58,201
Here we are.

44
00:03:58,463 --> 00:04:00,428
There you are.

45
00:04:00,463 --> 00:04:03,499
It's time to go to sleep.

46
00:04:03,525 --> 00:04:07,052
Maybe by next Christmas you'll
have a home.

47
00:04:13,543 --> 00:04:17,502
Merry Christmas, my angel.

48
00:04:44,318 --> 00:04:46,904
Mmm...

49
00:05:25,218 --> 00:05:27,952
All right, all right.

50
00:05:28,314 --> 00:05:31,818
We've had another very successful
year.

51
00:05:33,332 --> 00:05:35,492
So, after all that hard work,

52
00:05:35,512 --> 00:05:38,339
it's time to start preparations

53
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:40,038
for next Christmas!

54
00:05:49,301 --> 00:05:53,965
What in the name of Sam Hill
is that?

55
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,807
Wow...

56
00:06:00,544 --> 00:06:02,842
A baby...

57
00:06:05,269 --> 00:06:07,603
"Little Buddy" diapers.

58
00:06:07,852 --> 00:06:09,952
His name is Buddy. He must've...

59
00:06:09,987 --> 00:06:12,163
snuck into your sack at the
orphanage.

60
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,396
What do we do?

61
00:06:13,449 --> 00:06:15,992
<i>So, Santa had a decision to make,</i>

62
00:06:16,027 --> 00:06:17,877
<i>and fortunately, when it
comes to babies,</i>

63
00:06:17,926 --> 00:06:19,428
<i>Santa's a... a pushover.</i>

64
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:21,665
<i>So, Buddy stayed with, uh
an older elf</i>

65
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,007
<i>who had always wanted a child,</i>

66
00:06:23,053 --> 00:06:25,933
<i>but had been so committed to
building toys, he...</i>

67
00:06:25,966 --> 00:06:29,373
<i>he, well, had forgotten to...
to settle down.</i>

68
00:06:29,428 --> 00:06:30,366
Santa.

69
00:06:30,413 --> 00:06:33,465
Yes, yes, I... I raised Buddy.

70
00:06:33,505 --> 00:06:36,111
I was his adopted father.

71
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:37,846
<i>Though Buddy grew twice as fast,</i>

72
00:06:37,881 --> 00:06:42,085
<i>he... he wasn't any different from
the other children.</i>

73
00:06:43,306 --> 00:06:44,755
Not too fast, Buddy!

74
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,354
<i>I mean, not... not really.</i>

75
00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:49,274
Now before we learn how to build
the latest

76
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:51,175
in extreme graphic chipset
processors,

77
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:54,417
let's recite the Code
of the Elves, shall we?

78
00:06:54,445 --> 00:06:55,409
Number one.

79
00:06:55,495 --> 00:06:58,128
"Treat every day like Christmas."

80
00:06:58,181 --> 00:06:59,333
Number two.

81
00:06:59,368 --> 00:07:02,988
"There's room for everyone on the
Nice list."

82
00:07:03,026 --> 00:07:04,090
Number three.

83
00:07:04,782 --> 00:07:07,882
"The best way to
spread Christmas cheer

84
00:07:07,911 --> 00:07:11,709
"is singing loud for all to hear."

85
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:14,146
And one day, when Buddy was
old enough,

86
00:07:14,196 --> 00:07:17,266
I made him my own personal
apprentice.

87
00:07:17,332 --> 00:07:18,871
I've never been in this room
before.

88
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:22,890
Well, I think it's time you start
your tinker training.

89
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:26,926
Santa's sleigh.

90
00:07:26,961 --> 00:07:29,589
You're gonna help me make it fly.

91
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:33,701
I thought the magical reindeer made
the sleigh fly.

92
00:07:33,736 --> 00:07:36,503
And where do the reindeer get
their magic from?

93
00:07:36,538 --> 00:07:39,878
Christmas spirit. Everybody
knows that.

94
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:43,871
Well, silly as it sounds,

95
00:07:43,944 --> 00:07:46,690
a lot of people down south
don't believe in Santa Claus.

96
00:07:46,742 --> 00:07:47,797
What?!

97
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,119
Well, who do they think puts all
their toys under the tree?

98
00:07:52,154 --> 00:07:53,683
Well, there's a rumour floating around

99
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,956
that, uh, that the parents do it.

100
00:07:55,991 --> 00:07:57,889
That's... that's ridiculous.

101
00:07:57,924 --> 00:08:00,926
I mean, parents couldn't do that
all in one night.

102
00:08:00,961 --> 00:08:02,041
What about Santa's cookies?

103
00:08:02,061 --> 00:08:04,497
I suppose parents eat them, too?

104
00:08:04,532 --> 00:08:05,563
Yeah, I, uh, I... I know,

105
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:08,733
uh, and every year less and less
people believe in Santa Claus.

106
00:08:08,768 --> 00:08:11,814
I mean, we have a real energy
crisis on our hands.

107
00:08:11,868 --> 00:08:12,670
Oh.

108
00:08:12,705 --> 00:08:16,642
I mean, just see how low the, uh,
Clausometer is.

109
00:08:16,677 --> 00:08:18,444
That's shocking.

110
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,177
That's why I came up

111
00:08:20,212 --> 00:08:22,615
with this little beauty in the '60s.

112
00:08:27,218 --> 00:08:28,451
Wh-what is it?

113
00:08:28,486 --> 00:08:29,953
It's a Cringle 3000.

114
00:08:29,988 --> 00:08:33,658
A 500 reindeer-power jet turbine
engine.

115
00:08:33,693 --> 00:08:35,158
Without it, the sleigh couldn't

116
00:08:35,193 --> 00:08:39,129
get more than, uh, a few feet off
the ground.

117
00:08:40,999 --> 00:08:44,594
Well, it looks like we got
a short in the thermocoupler.

118
00:08:44,629 --> 00:08:46,604
You wanna give me a hand with that?

119
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:48,070
You want me to help?

120
00:08:49,038 --> 00:08:50,971
<i>As much as, uh, Buddy was accepted</i>

121
00:08:51,025 --> 00:08:52,643
by his family and friends,

122
00:08:52,678 --> 00:08:54,743
there were a few drawbacks

123
00:08:54,778 --> 00:08:58,549
to being, uh, a human in, uh
an elf's world.

124
00:09:19,128 --> 00:09:20,901
Hey, Ming Ming.

125
00:09:21,045 --> 00:09:21,976
Um...

126
00:09:23,088 --> 00:09:26,755
I'm gonna be a little bit short
on today's quota.

127
00:09:26,803 --> 00:09:28,047
It's all right, Buddy.

128
00:09:28,177 --> 00:09:32,983
Just how many Etch-a-Sketches
did you get finished?

129
00:09:33,018 --> 00:09:35,979
Come on, Buddy. How many?

130
00:09:36,019 --> 00:09:40,518
I made, uh... eighty-five?

131
00:09:45,446 --> 00:09:47,505
Eighty-five?

132
00:09:48,763 --> 00:09:50,628
That puts you...

133
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:52,566
915 off the pace.

134
00:09:52,601 --> 00:09:54,134
Ooh... that's bad.

135
00:09:54,169 --> 00:09:55,535
Why don't you just say it?

136
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:58,089
I'm the worst toy maker in
the world.

137
00:09:58,124 --> 00:10:00,608
I'm a cotton-headed ninny-muggins.

138
00:10:01,728 --> 00:10:04,044
No, Buddy, you're not a
cotton-headed ninny-muggins.

139
00:10:04,568 --> 00:10:06,808
We all just have different talents,
that's all.

140
00:10:06,869 --> 00:10:09,515
Seems like everyone else has the
same talents except for me.

141
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:12,353
You... you have, you have lots of
talents, uh...

142
00:10:12,388 --> 00:10:15,890
special talents, in fact, like...
um... uh...

143
00:10:15,925 --> 00:10:16,655
Special talents?

144
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:19,393
You changed the batteries in the
smoke detector!

145
00:10:19,428 --> 00:10:20,674
You sure did... triple As.

146
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,187
And in six months, you'll have
to check 'em again...

147
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,129
won't he?

148
00:10:24,164 --> 00:10:26,866
And you're the only baritone in
the elf choir.

149
00:10:26,901 --> 00:10:28,620
You bring us down a whole octave.

150
00:10:28,683 --> 00:10:29,983
In a good way!

151
00:10:31,025 --> 00:10:31,703
See, Buddy?

152
00:10:31,738 --> 00:10:33,745
You're not a cotton-headed
ninny-muggins.

153
00:10:33,794 --> 00:10:37,593
You're just... special.

154
00:10:38,877 --> 00:10:43,716
<i>And so, Buddy was sent where the...
the "special" elves work.</i>

155
00:10:43,751 --> 00:10:45,877
Aah!

156
00:10:57,262 --> 00:10:59,765
Aah!

157
00:11:20,991 --> 00:11:22,038
Hey, Foom Foom...

158
00:11:22,418 --> 00:11:24,004
I hate to do this to you, but...

159
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:26,290
you think you could help me pick up
the slack on those Etch-a-Sketches?

160
00:11:26,325 --> 00:11:28,172
- No problem.
- I appreciate it.

161
00:11:28,218 --> 00:11:29,619
Buddy is killing me.

162
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:32,730
I already got Lum-Lum and Choo-Choo
pulling doubles.

163
00:11:32,765 --> 00:11:34,282
That was quick thinking yesterday

164
00:11:34,317 --> 00:11:35,725
with that "special talents" thing.

165
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,048
I feel bad for the guy.

166
00:11:37,082 --> 00:11:38,300
I just hope he doesn't get wise.

167
00:11:38,335 --> 00:11:41,813
Well, if he hasn't figured out
he's a human by now,

168
00:11:41,853 --> 00:11:44,304
I don't think he ever will.

169
00:11:48,537 --> 00:11:53,306
<i>If he hasn't figured out he's a human
by now, I don't think he ever will.</i>

170
00:11:54,076 --> 00:11:56,977
I think they're too small.

171
00:11:58,855 --> 00:12:03,154
<i>You're just... special.</i>

172
00:12:08,904 --> 00:12:10,904
<i>...bring us down a whole octave!</i>

173
00:12:20,743 --> 00:12:22,409
You don't look so good, Buddy.

174
00:12:22,436 --> 00:12:23,629
Are you okay?

175
00:12:23,716 --> 00:12:26,589
I'll be okay, I just need a glass
of water.

176
00:12:26,609 --> 00:12:28,769
Aah!

177
00:12:29,977 --> 00:12:31,083
Buddy...

178
00:12:32,726 --> 00:12:34,921
Unh! Aah!

179
00:12:52,425 --> 00:12:54,460
Buddy, are you okay?

180
00:12:55,186 --> 00:12:56,742
I'm sorry, Papa.

181
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:59,177
I just need some alone time.

182
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:01,782
Buddy, I... I think we... we have
to talk.

183
00:13:02,677 --> 00:13:04,936
Buddy, uh, I think there's something

184
00:13:04,971 --> 00:13:08,020
I... I probably should tell you.

185
00:13:08,055 --> 00:13:11,380
You probably should have found
out a long...

186
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,691
a long time ago.

187
00:13:12,726 --> 00:13:15,761
<i>I then proceeded to tell Buddy of
how his father</i>

188
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:18,698
<i>had fallen in love when he was
very young</i>

189
00:13:18,733 --> 00:13:21,600
<i>with a beautiful girl named
Susan Wells,</i>

190
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:22,733
<i>and how Buddy was born</i>

191
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:25,271
<i>and put up for adoption by
his mother.</i>

192
00:13:25,306 --> 00:13:28,240
<i>And how she had later passed away.</i>

193
00:13:28,275 --> 00:13:29,240
<i>I... I told him his father</i>

194
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:31,777
<i>had never even known that
Buddy was born,</i>

195
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:32,543
<i>and most importantly,</i>

196
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:34,478
<i>I told him where his father was...</i>

197
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:38,331
<i>uh, in a magical land called
New York City.</i>

198
00:13:38,364 --> 00:13:40,324
My dad works there?

199
00:13:40,371 --> 00:13:41,744
Empire State building.

200
00:13:47,492 --> 00:13:49,894
Hey, Buddy, wanna pick some
snow berries?

201
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:52,761
Not now, Arctic Puffin.

202
00:13:53,998 --> 00:13:57,431
- Hello, Buddy.
- Oh... hi, Leon.

203
00:13:57,471 --> 00:13:59,204
Why the long face, partner?

204
00:13:59,258 --> 00:14:02,138
It seems I'm... I'm not an elf.

205
00:14:02,184 --> 00:14:06,650
'Course you're not. You're 6'3"
and had a beard since you were 15.

206
00:14:06,697 --> 00:14:11,057
Papa says my real father
lives in a magical place far away.

207
00:14:11,103 --> 00:14:12,329
I don't know what to do.

208
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:13,716
At least you have a daddy.

209
00:14:13,756 --> 00:14:17,588
I was just rolled up one day and
left out here in the cold.

210
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:20,290
But the thing is, I've never even left
the North Pole.

211
00:14:20,325 --> 00:14:22,676
Buddy, I've been around the world
many times

212
00:14:22,711 --> 00:14:25,377
when I was a young
cumulonimbus cloud.

213
00:14:25,424 --> 00:14:28,611
It's a wonderful place, filled with
wondrous creatures...

214
00:14:28,651 --> 00:14:29,397
except dogs.

215
00:14:29,432 --> 00:14:31,857
Oh, by the way, don't eat the
yellow snow.

216
00:14:31,889 --> 00:14:33,056
Oh, I know that.

217
00:14:33,129 --> 00:14:37,006
All I'm sayin' is, this might be
the golden opportunity

218
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,804
to find out who you really are.

219
00:14:42,678 --> 00:14:44,946
So, I hear you're going

220
00:14:44,981 --> 00:14:47,532
on a little journey to
the big city.

221
00:14:47,578 --> 00:14:49,083
- Yup.
- Ahh.

222
00:14:49,104 --> 00:14:50,858
I'm kinda nervous.

223
00:14:50,987 --> 00:14:52,778
Leon says New York is pretty
different.

224
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:54,905
Oh, don't pay attention to Leon.

225
00:14:54,945 --> 00:14:57,993
He's never been anywhere.
He doesn't have any feet.

226
00:14:58,028 --> 00:15:00,358
I've been to New York thousands
of times.

227
00:15:00,437 --> 00:15:01,611
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

228
00:15:01,682 --> 00:15:02,596
What's it like?

229
00:15:02,871 --> 00:15:05,188
Well, there are some things you
should know.

230
00:15:05,235 --> 00:15:08,070
First off, you see gum on
the street,

231
00:15:08,105 --> 00:15:10,639
leave it there. It's not
free candy.

232
00:15:10,674 --> 00:15:11,838
- Oh.
- Second,

233
00:15:11,873 --> 00:15:15,286
there are, like, 30 Ray's
Pizzas.

234
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,977
They all claim to be the
original,

235
00:15:17,012 --> 00:15:18,611
but the real one's on 11th.

236
00:15:18,926 --> 00:15:22,166
And if you see a sign that
says "Peep Show",

237
00:15:22,193 --> 00:15:26,752
that doesn't mean that they're letting
you look at presents before Christmas.

238
00:15:26,802 --> 00:15:27,913
Can't wait to see my dad; we...

239
00:15:27,955 --> 00:15:31,425
we're gonna go ice skating and...
and eat sugar plums.

240
00:15:32,321 --> 00:15:35,628
Yeah, that's the other thing
I wanted to talk to you about.

241
00:15:36,221 --> 00:15:38,801
You know, Buddy...

242
00:15:39,376 --> 00:15:41,886
your father...

243
00:15:42,035 --> 00:15:45,438
well...
he's on the Naughty list.

244
00:15:45,473 --> 00:15:48,930
No!

245
00:15:50,402 --> 00:15:53,866
You're taking the books back?

246
00:15:55,048 --> 00:15:57,383
Ha! See, I...
I see what you're trying to do here.

247
00:15:57,418 --> 00:15:59,236
Y-You're trying to make me feel bad,

248
00:15:59,271 --> 00:16:02,089
when, in actuality, you're the one
that missed the payments.

249
00:16:02,121 --> 00:16:06,058
But the children love the books.

250
00:16:06,093 --> 00:16:06,890
I know that, uh...

251
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:09,194
you know, I'm the one that ran
the focus groups,

252
00:16:09,229 --> 00:16:10,661
but I like hearing that.

253
00:16:10,696 --> 00:16:15,866
Listen, some people, they just lose
sight of what's important in life.

254
00:16:16,354 --> 00:16:21,254
That doesn't mean they can't find
their way again, huh?

255
00:16:21,321 --> 00:16:25,210
Maybe all they need
is just a little Christmas spirit.

256
00:16:27,926 --> 00:16:30,461
Well, uh, I... I'm good at that.

257
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:32,978
I know you are.

258
00:16:45,029 --> 00:16:46,929
And I'll...

259
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:47,975
I'll always, uh,

260
00:16:48,011 --> 00:16:51,037
I'll always be here for you.

261
00:16:57,006 --> 00:16:59,437
Now, uh... go.

262
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:02,035
Uh, get.

263
00:17:12,562 --> 00:17:13,722
Bye, guys.

264
00:17:14,009 --> 00:17:17,027
- Bye, Buddy.
- Bye, Buddy. Take care.

265
00:17:17,062 --> 00:17:19,017
Bye-bye.

266
00:17:20,156 --> 00:17:21,756
Bye-bye.

267
00:17:22,105 --> 00:17:23,339
Bye-bye, Buddy.

268
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,012
There, there.

269
00:17:29,505 --> 00:17:31,404
Huh? Ohhhhh!

270
00:17:31,439 --> 00:17:33,304
Oh! Ohh!

271
00:17:36,045 --> 00:17:38,865
Bye, Buddy. Hope you find your dad.

272
00:17:38,902 --> 00:17:40,858
Thanks, Mr. Narwhal.

273
00:17:41,422 --> 00:17:42,889
Bye.

274
00:18:33,798 --> 00:18:36,092
Hey! What's your name?

275
00:18:36,757 --> 00:18:39,452
My name's Buddy.

276
00:18:42,014 --> 00:18:43,311
Oh!

277
00:18:46,098 --> 00:18:48,100
Does someone need a hug?

278
00:18:52,251 --> 00:18:55,086
Aah, aah!

279
00:18:55,853 --> 00:18:57,946
I just wanted a hug!

Oh! Beautiful.

316
00:22:18,982 --> 00:22:21,542
Looks like a Christmas tree.

317
00:22:22,552 --> 00:22:24,586
A reprint?

318
00:22:24,921 --> 00:22:26,790
You know how much
that's gonna cost?

319
00:22:26,825 --> 00:22:27,956
Two whole pages are missing.

320
00:22:27,991 --> 00:22:29,224
The story doesn't make any sense.

321
00:22:29,259 --> 00:22:31,511
What, you think some kid's gonna
notice two pages?

322
00:22:31,546 --> 00:22:33,762
I mean, they... all they do is look
at pictures.

323
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:38,083
Sorry I can't ride with you the
rest of the way up,

324
00:22:38,118 --> 00:22:40,263
but this is where my dad works.
Well, have a good...

325
00:22:40,303 --> 00:22:41,877
oh, I forgot to give you a hug!

326
00:22:41,917 --> 00:22:45,116
Oh, I don't know, Connie, I've
never declawed kittens before.

327
00:22:45,162 --> 00:22:46,093
How many?

328
00:22:46,796 --> 00:22:47,942
Eight?

329
00:22:48,463 --> 00:22:50,363
Uh, I don't know if I'm gonna
have time.

330
00:22:50,722 --> 00:22:52,364
Oh, all right, just bring 'em by
the camper this week,

331
00:22:52,399 --> 00:22:54,162
and I'll see what I can do.

332
00:22:54,349 --> 00:22:57,318
I'm not gonna charge you. Just bring
'em by, and I'll see what I can do.

333
00:22:57,353 --> 00:22:59,052
- I have to go.
- Excuse me.

334
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:02,457
I'm here to see a Walter Hobbs.

335
00:23:02,492 --> 00:23:03,923
I'm Buddy the elf.

336
00:23:03,958 --> 00:23:07,528
You look hilarious! Who sent you?

337
00:23:07,563 --> 00:23:09,349
- Papa elf.
- Papa elf?

338
00:23:09,377 --> 00:23:11,095
Mm-hmm. From the North Pole.

339
00:23:11,116 --> 00:23:12,932
- From the North Pole?
- Yes.

340
00:23:12,967 --> 00:23:14,587
So, you really think we should
ship 'em?

341
00:23:14,653 --> 00:23:18,474
No, I think we should take a
$30,000 bath

342
00:23:18,513 --> 00:23:22,042
so some kid can understand what happened
to a puppy and a friggin' pigeon.

343
00:23:22,077 --> 00:23:23,961
Ship 'em.

344
00:23:25,363 --> 00:23:26,024
Yeah.

345
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:28,582
<i>Mr. Hobbs? It's me on the intercom.</i>

346
00:23:28,617 --> 00:23:29,203
Go ahead.

347
00:23:29,237 --> 00:23:32,611
Yeah, I think someone sent you a
Christmas-gram.

348
00:23:33,447 --> 00:23:34,914
Dad!

349
00:23:38,392 --> 00:23:41,211
All right, uh, let's get it
over with.

350
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,996
I walked all day and night to
find you!

351
00:23:44,031 --> 00:23:46,966
Uh, you look like you came from
the North Pole.

352
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,635
That's exactly where I came from.

353
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:51,321
Santa must've called you!

354
00:23:51,356 --> 00:23:52,937
Oh, yeah, sure, he, uh...

355
00:23:52,972 --> 00:23:54,515
just got off the cell phone
with me.

356
00:23:54,555 --> 00:23:55,786
You did?!

357
00:23:55,889 --> 00:23:58,609
- So, go on.
- Go on with what?

358
00:23:58,862 --> 00:24:00,589
Well, are... are you gonna sing a
song or something...

359
00:24:00,622 --> 00:24:02,355
or can I just go back to work?

360
00:24:02,382 --> 00:24:05,215
A song? Uh...

361
00:24:05,551 --> 00:24:10,955
Yeah. Anything for you, dad, uh...

362
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:15,910

You know, usually you guys just,
uh, you know,

372
00:24:41,949 --> 00:24:43,915
put my name into Jingle Bells or
something.

373
00:24:43,975 --> 00:24:45,593
It's me, your son.

374
00:24:45,628 --> 00:24:48,425
Susan Wells had me, and... and she
didn't tell you,

375
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,396
and, and, and, but now I'm here...

376
00:24:50,436 --> 00:24:51,653
it's me, Buddy.

377
00:24:51,821 --> 00:24:52,968
Susan Wells.

378
00:24:53,397 --> 00:24:56,696
- Uh, you said Susan Wells?
- Yes.

379
00:24:57,101 --> 00:24:58,767
Who sent this Christmas-gram?

380
00:24:58,801 --> 00:25:01,137
What's a Christmas-gram?
I want one!

381
00:25:01,832 --> 00:25:03,212
I think we should call security...

382
00:25:03,258 --> 00:25:04,145
Good idea!

383
00:25:04,245 --> 00:25:05,774
I like to whisper too!

384
00:25:06,854 --> 00:25:08,834
It's okay, Walter's my father.

385
00:25:08,861 --> 00:25:10,913
Well, your dad's busy right now.

386
00:25:10,948 --> 00:25:12,146
Okay, I'll come back later.

387
00:25:12,181 --> 00:25:14,591
Yeah, you know, you're not gonna
come back for awhile, okay?

388
00:25:14,637 --> 00:25:17,244
- You're gonna go back to Santa Land.
- Okay.

389
00:25:17,292 --> 00:25:20,557
Yeah, why don't you go back
to Gimbels?

390
00:25:38,146 --> 00:25:40,740
Sorry! Sorry.

391
00:25:53,141 --> 00:25:54,907
Passion fruit spray?

392
00:25:54,933 --> 00:25:57,262
Fruit spray? Sure.

393
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:16,241
Sorry.

394
00:26:18,998 --> 00:26:20,295
Sorry.

395
00:26:25,005 --> 00:26:26,802
Do you wanna go?

396
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:43,799
Hey! Have you seen these
toilets?

397
00:26:43,837 --> 00:26:46,498
They're ginormous!

398
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:50,328
"For that special someone."

399
00:26:53,285 --> 00:26:54,686
Psst!

400
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,765
Hey, come... come here!

401
00:26:58,812 --> 00:27:01,677
- Me?
- Yes.

402
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:06,789
What are you doing down here?

403
00:27:07,257 --> 00:27:09,594
You're not supposed to be
down here!

404
00:27:09,629 --> 00:27:10,793
You can shop on your break,

405
00:27:10,828 --> 00:27:12,662
you don't... come on, get upstairs!

406
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:15,081
- Okay, I didn't know.
- Well, you should know!

407
00:27:15,114 --> 00:27:16,532
- Are you mad at me?
- No.

408
00:27:16,567 --> 00:27:17,774
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

409
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:20,838
- Just do your job.
- Okay, fair enough.

410
00:27:20,873 --> 00:27:22,646
Wow!

411
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,360
- What's this?
- This is the North Pole.

412
00:27:25,446 --> 00:27:27,586
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

413
00:27:27,629 --> 00:27:28,873
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

414
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,413
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is.

415
00:27:30,446 --> 00:27:32,160
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is.

416
00:27:32,195 --> 00:27:35,130
No, it's not. Where's the snow?

417
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,873
Why you smiling like that?

418
00:27:36,953 --> 00:27:39,254
I just like to smile, smiling's
my favourite.

419
00:27:39,939 --> 00:27:41,799
Make work your favourite, that's
your favourite, okay?

420
00:27:41,866 --> 00:27:43,153
- Okay.
- Work is your new favourite.

421
00:27:43,188 --> 00:27:44,013
Fine.

422
00:27:44,561 --> 00:27:46,540
- It's time for the announcement.
- Okay.

423
00:27:46,567 --> 00:27:49,865
Okay, people, tomorrow
morning, 10 a.m.,

424
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:50,880
Santa's comin' to town!

425
00:27:50,914 --> 00:27:52,281
Santa!

426
00:27:52,341 --> 00:27:53,960
Oh, my God!

427
00:27:54,336 --> 00:27:58,016
Santa here?! I know him.

428
00:27:58,109 --> 00:27:59,176
I know him.

429
00:27:59,262 --> 00:28:01,542
He'll be here to take pictures
with all the children.

430
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:02,582
Yeah!

431
00:28:02,628 --> 00:28:05,362
Just keep your receipts.
10 a.m. Tomorrow.

432
00:28:05,382 --> 00:28:06,275
10 a.m. Tomorrow.

433
00:28:06,315 --> 00:28:07,683
Santa's coming to town.

434
00:28:07,709 --> 00:28:09,744
- Yes!
- Can you sign this for me?

435
00:28:09,773 --> 00:28:14,474
Ohh! Hi. Santa's coming!

436
00:28:34,188 --> 00:28:35,415
Are you enjoying the view?

437
00:28:35,523 --> 00:28:38,712
You are very good at decorating
that tree.

438
00:28:39,946 --> 00:28:42,500
Why are you messing with me?
Did Krumpet put you up to this?

439
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,116
I'm not messing with you.

440
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:48,664
It's just nice to meet another human who
shares my affinity for elf culture.

441
00:28:49,379 --> 00:28:51,158
I'm just trying to get
through the holidays.

442
00:28:51,192 --> 00:28:52,079
Get through?

443
00:28:52,139 --> 00:28:54,632
Christmas is the greatest
day in the whole wide world!

444
00:28:54,663 --> 00:28:56,147
Please stop talking to me.

445
00:28:56,185 --> 00:28:59,571
Uh-oh. Sounds like someone
needs to sing a Christmas carol.

446
00:28:59,625 --> 00:29:00,869
Go away.

447
00:29:00,894 --> 00:29:03,992
"The best way to spread Christmas cheer
is singing loud for all to hear."

448
00:29:04,065 --> 00:29:05,992
Thanks, but I don't sing.

449
00:29:06,032 --> 00:29:07,715
Oh, it's easy, it's just like
talking...

450
00:29:07,754 --> 00:29:10,107
except louder and longer and you
move your voice up and down.

451
00:29:10,142 --> 00:29:12,878
I can sing, but I just choose not
to sing.

452
00:29:12,913 --> 00:29:15,064
Especially in front of other
people.

453
00:29:15,099 --> 00:29:17,181
Well, if you sing alone,
you can sing

454
00:29:17,216 --> 00:29:19,096
in front of other people. There's
no difference.

455
00:29:19,106 --> 00:29:21,420
Actually, there's a big difference.

456
00:29:21,455 --> 00:29:23,032
No, there... no, there isn't.

it's from me, Buddy, his son, okay?

523
00:34:25,914 --> 00:34:27,600
- Okay.
- And that I love him so much,

524
00:34:27,634 --> 00:34:29,427
and that I think he's the greatest
dad in the world.

525
00:34:29,487 --> 00:34:31,082
You guys are so strong.

00:34:31,117 --> 00:34:33,551

534
00:35:05,017 --> 00:35:06,963
- Hey, you.
- Me?

535
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:09,896
Come here. I wanna talk to you.

536
00:35:12,323 --> 00:35:14,124
What do you wanna talk to
me about?

537
00:35:14,165 --> 00:35:17,096
How come you were in the women's
locker room this morning?

538
00:35:17,149 --> 00:35:18,409
I heard you singing.

539
00:35:18,442 --> 00:35:19,955
You sure it had nothing to
do with the fact

540
00:35:19,995 --> 00:35:21,973
that I was naked in the shower?

541
00:35:22,021 --> 00:35:23,662
I didn't know you were naked.

542
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,312
Why were you here so early?

543
00:35:26,081 --> 00:35:27,603
They shut my water off.

544
00:35:28,164 --> 00:35:30,506
What were you doing here so
early?

545
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:32,925
Building this.

546
00:35:34,077 --> 00:35:36,110
- You built this?
- Mm-hmm.

547
00:35:36,145 --> 00:35:38,285
They're kinda pissed about this.

548
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:39,598
Really?

549
00:35:40,436 --> 00:35:41,903
Hey, guys.

550
00:35:42,385 --> 00:35:43,384
- Have you seen the place?
- Mm-hmm.

551
00:35:43,419 --> 00:35:45,521
It's pretty good. It's a
little too good.

552
00:35:46,229 --> 00:35:48,261
Corporate must have sent in a
professional.

553
00:35:48,829 --> 00:35:50,922
I don't know why somebody's
gunning for my job,

554
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:53,925
but, look... let's
remain a team, okay?

555
00:35:53,991 --> 00:35:56,618
'Cause if I go, we all go.

556
00:35:56,658 --> 00:35:58,031
If you get wind of anything,

557
00:35:58,066 --> 00:36:01,045
call me on my radio.
Channel three.

558
00:36:01,105 --> 00:36:03,705
Code word is:
"Santa's got a brand new bag".

559
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,036
Okay?

560
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,333
Six-inch ribbon curls, honey.

561
00:36:07,428 --> 00:36:10,413
- That's impossible.
- Six... inches.

562
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:16,918
By the way... I think you have

563
00:36:16,953 --> 00:36:20,677
the most beautiful singing voice
in the whole wide world.

564
00:36:27,741 --> 00:36:29,407
Santa...

565
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:32,433
Hey, hey! Ho ho ho!

566
00:36:33,094 --> 00:36:34,427
Yeah!

567
00:36:34,774 --> 00:36:37,937
Yeah! It's me, Buddy!

568
00:36:37,972 --> 00:36:40,975
- It's me!
- Hey, Buddy, how you doing?

569
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:41,941
It's me!

570
00:36:41,976 --> 00:36:43,610
Are you ready to see Santa?

571
00:36:43,998 --> 00:36:45,362
Who the heck are you?

572
00:36:45,471 --> 00:36:47,191
What are you talking about?
I'm Santa Claus.

573
00:36:47,211 --> 00:36:48,413
No, you're not.

574
00:36:48,721 --> 00:36:51,454
Uh... why, of course I am!

575
00:36:51,492 --> 00:36:52,423
Ho ho ho ho ho!

576
00:36:52,454 --> 00:36:54,452
Well, if you're Santa...

577
00:36:54,487 --> 00:36:57,657
what song did I sing for you on
your birthday this year?

578
00:36:57,692 --> 00:37:00,935
Uh, "Happy Birthday", of course!

579
00:37:00,982 --> 00:37:02,296
Ho ho ho ho ho!

580
00:37:02,342 --> 00:37:05,242
Uh, so, how old are you, son?

581
00:37:05,282 --> 00:37:06,000
Four.

582
00:37:06,032 --> 00:37:07,742
You're a big boy. What's your name?

583
00:37:07,795 --> 00:37:09,249
- Paul.
- And, uh, what can I get you for Christmas?

584
00:37:09,282 --> 00:37:11,236
Paul... don't tell him what
you want.

585
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:14,092
- He's a liar.
- Let the kid talk.

586
00:37:14,138 --> 00:37:16,705
You disgust me. How can you live
with yourself?

587
00:37:16,744 --> 00:37:18,865
- Just cool it, Zippy.
- Smile.

588
00:37:18,919 --> 00:37:20,912
You sit on a throne of lies.

589
00:37:20,946 --> 00:37:22,885
- Look, I'm not kidding.
- You're a fake.

590
00:37:22,932 --> 00:37:24,081
- I'm a fake?
- Yes.

591
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:26,192
How'd you like to be dead, huh?

592
00:37:26,204 --> 00:37:29,181
- Fake.
- No, he's kidding.

593
00:37:29,238 --> 00:37:30,151
You stink.

594
00:37:30,198 --> 00:37:32,118
I think you're gonna have a good
Christmas, all right?

595
00:37:32,151 --> 00:37:33,598
You smell like beef and cheese.

596
00:37:33,624 --> 00:37:34,851
You don't smell like Santa.

597
00:37:34,927 --> 00:37:36,127
Okay.

598
00:37:38,693 --> 00:37:42,124
He's an imposter!
He's not Santa!

599
00:37:43,033 --> 00:37:45,813
- He's a fake! He's a fake!
- Come here. Come here!

600
00:37:45,845 --> 00:37:47,277
I saw it!

601
00:37:49,807 --> 00:37:51,536
He's a fake!

602
00:37:57,147 --> 00:38:00,583
Ha ha! Where you going now?
Where you going...?

603
00:38:08,825 --> 00:38:10,656
No!

604
00:38:13,663 --> 00:38:16,629
He's not Santa Claus!

605
00:38:16,681 --> 00:38:18,443
He's not Santa!

606
00:38:20,702 --> 00:38:22,465
"To someone special."

607
00:38:49,403 --> 00:38:51,572
- What's that?
- Intercom.

608
00:38:51,768 --> 00:38:53,835
All right.

609
00:38:57,538 --> 00:39:00,338
- Yeah?
<i>- Mr. Hobbs, the police are on line one.</i>

610
00:39:00,383 --> 00:39:03,150
Police. Hello?

611
00:39:21,501 --> 00:39:22,528
Dad!

612
00:39:22,821 --> 00:39:24,798
I knew that you'd come,
I love you for coming.

613
00:39:24,833 --> 00:39:26,367
Officer Tom, this is my dad.

614
00:39:26,402 --> 00:39:27,901
This is Walter... he came.

615
00:39:27,936 --> 00:39:28,854
He bailed me out.

616
00:39:28,894 --> 00:39:30,280
They gave me one phone call.

617
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,103
They gave me one phone call,

618
00:39:31,138 --> 00:39:33,140
and I said, "I know who
I'm gonna call...

619
00:39:33,174 --> 00:39:34,272
"Walter Hobbs."

620
00:39:34,307 --> 00:39:35,273
And sure enough, you showed up.

621
00:39:35,308 --> 00:39:37,326
You did, they said you weren't
gonna show up.

622
00:39:37,361 --> 00:39:39,783
- They told me so many times...
- Shh shh shh shh shh.

623
00:39:39,816 --> 00:39:42,615
Just who the heck are you,
and what is your problem?

624
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:44,750
I-I'm Buddy; I'm your son.

625
00:39:44,785 --> 00:39:46,136
Wait, um...

626
00:39:46,183 --> 00:39:48,209
Tell me, tell me, tell me, uh...

627
00:39:48,263 --> 00:39:49,589
where'd you get this picture?

628
00:39:49,624 --> 00:39:52,183
Papa elf gave it to me.

629
00:39:53,092 --> 00:39:55,094
Listen... is this some kind a
game?

630
00:39:55,129 --> 00:39:56,212
What do you want, some money?

631
00:39:56,272 --> 00:39:58,118
No! I just wanted to meet you,

632
00:39:58,163 --> 00:40:01,394
and I thought you might
wanna meet me.

633
00:40:06,657 --> 00:40:08,634
Who wouldn't wanna meet you?

634
00:40:09,537 --> 00:40:11,209
I thought maybe we could make
Gingerbread houses,

635
00:40:11,244 --> 00:40:13,290
and eat cookie dough, and go
ice skating, and...

636
00:40:13,326 --> 00:40:15,527
and maybe even hold hands.

637
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:19,501
- Come with me.
- Okay.

638
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:29,703
Okay. What have we got here?

639
00:40:39,236 --> 00:40:41,466
Buddy, don't eat those.

640
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:47,369
Ohh!

641
00:40:48,317 --> 00:40:51,396
We got to really hurry up, Walter, 'cause I'm
double-booked the rest of the afternoon.

642
00:40:51,468 --> 00:40:53,516
- Am I sick?
- Yeah, but that's not why we're here.

643
00:40:53,571 --> 00:40:54,709
We're here to do a test, come on.

644
00:40:54,751 --> 00:40:56,089
- What kinda test?
- Just a test to find out

645
00:40:56,136 --> 00:40:58,236
- if you're my son or not.
- Why am I sitting on paper?

646
00:40:58,276 --> 00:40:59,973
Because it's sanitary for the
other patients.

647
00:41:00,008 --> 00:41:01,958
Now, sit still so I can do
the finger prick.

648
00:41:01,993 --> 00:41:03,577
Finger prick!

649
00:41:03,612 --> 00:41:05,126
Ohh! It's cold.

650
00:41:05,161 --> 00:41:06,809
Yeah, just please sit still, please?

651
00:41:06,853 --> 00:41:07,953
Okay, can I listen to your
necklace?

652
00:41:07,993 --> 00:41:09,593
No, you can't. Will you
just sit still...

653
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:11,049
- Why is there a skeleton over there?
- I don't know, Walter, could you please...?

654
00:41:11,084 --> 00:41:13,266
- If I squint it looks like a pirate flag.
- Could you please have him sit still?

655
00:41:13,301 --> 00:41:14,736
- Does he have a name?
- No, he hasn't got a name.

656
00:41:14,771 --> 00:41:15,832
- I'm sorry, Ben, I am sorry.
- I have a lot of patients waiting.

657
00:41:15,846 --> 00:41:17,358
Would you please sit still?
Please.

658
00:41:17,452 --> 00:41:19,906
- He got mad at me.
- Yes, he did. He did.

659
00:41:19,941 --> 00:41:22,943
The sooner you sit still, the sooner
we can get this mess over with.

660
00:41:22,978 --> 00:41:24,429
Okay. Then can we eat sugar
plums?

661
00:41:24,464 --> 00:41:26,221
You betcha... we'll eat
sugar plums,

662
00:41:26,254 --> 00:41:28,817
have gingerbread houses,
and we'll even paint eggs.

663
00:41:28,852 --> 00:41:31,217
Well, paint eggs, that's Easter.

664
00:41:31,613 --> 00:41:34,947
Ow! Ohh...

665
00:41:35,289 --> 00:41:37,356
My finger has a heartbeat.

666
00:41:37,391 --> 00:41:40,194
It won't hurt so much after
a little.

667
00:41:40,229 --> 00:41:42,629
- What's your name?
- Buddy.

668
00:41:43,397 --> 00:41:44,965
I'm Carolyn.

669
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:46,452
Hi.

670
00:41:47,509 --> 00:41:49,969
- What do you want for Christmas?
- A Suzy-Talks-a-Lot.

671
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:52,740
I'll put in a good word with
the big man.

672
00:41:52,775 --> 00:41:54,674
Thanks. Your costume is pretty.

673
00:41:55,308 --> 00:41:58,012
Oh, it's not a costume.
I'm an elf.

674
00:41:58,047 --> 00:41:59,913
Well, technically, I'm a human,

675
00:41:59,948 --> 00:42:01,379
but I was raised by elves.

676
00:42:01,414 --> 00:42:04,784
Oh, I'm a human raised by humans.

677
00:42:04,819 --> 00:42:07,446
Hmm. Cool.

678
00:42:13,258 --> 00:42:14,783
So?

679
00:42:16,362 --> 00:42:19,566
It's a boy... Buddy's your son.

680
00:42:19,601 --> 00:42:21,199
That's very impossible.

681
00:42:21,234 --> 00:42:22,594
You... you saw that guy out there.

682
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:24,336
He's... he's certifiably insane.

683
00:42:24,364 --> 00:42:27,982
He's probably just reverting to a
state of childlike dependency.

684
00:42:28,002 --> 00:42:29,168
An elf?

685
00:42:29,228 --> 00:42:31,263
What he needs is to be nurtured.

686
00:42:31,318 --> 00:42:33,302
Oh, I see.

687
00:42:33,497 --> 00:42:35,412
So, um, uh...

688
00:42:35,634 --> 00:42:37,087
You'd like me to breastfeed him?

689
00:42:37,167 --> 00:42:39,147
Walter, just bring him home.

690
00:42:39,193 --> 00:42:40,793
Introduce him to Emily and
Michael,

691
00:42:40,833 --> 00:42:43,573
and once... once he comes to
terms with reality,

692
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:45,959
he should drop the whole elf thing
and move on with his life.

693
00:42:45,986 --> 00:42:47,892
I mean, that's what I would do if
I were you.

694
00:42:48,313 --> 00:42:51,462
Oh, my God! Walter, this is...

695
00:42:51,497 --> 00:42:52,762
this is wonderful!

696
00:42:52,797 --> 00:42:55,424
You... you have another son.

697
00:42:55,464 --> 00:42:57,297
Wonderful. Oh, gosh, I...

698
00:42:57,350 --> 00:43:01,370
- I guess I never really thought of it that way.
- This is incredible, I...

699
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:03,024
You know, it's a little
complicated,

700
00:43:03,059 --> 00:43:04,665
but it's nothing that we can't
handle.

701
00:43:04,704 --> 00:43:07,137
- Honey?
- What?

702
00:43:07,779 --> 00:43:10,590
He thinks he's an elf.

703
00:43:10,657 --> 00:43:11,880
I'm sorry, what?

704
00:43:11,915 --> 00:43:14,584
He think he's a Christmas elf.

705
00:43:14,619 --> 00:43:15,617
Oh, come on, Walter,

706
00:43:15,643 --> 00:43:19,516
I'm sure he doesn't actually
think he's an elf.

707
00:43:19,623 --> 00:43:24,716
And then, I travelled through the seven
levels of the Candy Cane Forest,

708
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:28,798
past the Sea of Swirly-Twirly
Gumdrops,

709
00:43:28,832 --> 00:43:34,498
and then, I walked through the
Lincoln Tunnel.

710
00:43:51,554 --> 00:43:53,249
Ahh.

711
00:43:55,194 --> 00:43:58,520
So, where were you for the
last 30 years?

712
00:43:58,554 --> 00:43:59,560
The North Pole.

713
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:01,181
Can you pass the maple syrup,
please?

714
00:44:01,248 --> 00:44:04,915
I... I didn't put... it's
spaghetti.

715
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,770
Oh, you know what? I think
I have some.

716
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,997
Yes.

717
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:13,845
You like sugar, huh?

718
00:44:13,866 --> 00:44:15,513
Is there sugar in syrup?

719
00:44:15,552 --> 00:44:16,466
Yes.

720
00:44:16,497 --> 00:44:17,730
Then yes.

721
00:44:18,959 --> 00:44:21,557
We elves try to stick to the
four main food groups:

722
00:44:21,616 --> 00:44:26,987
candy, candy canes, candy corns,
and syrup.

723
00:44:27,335 --> 00:44:30,275
So, will you be staying with us,
then?

724
00:44:30,312 --> 00:44:31,588
You mean I can stay?

725
00:44:31,638 --> 00:44:33,555
- Of course you can.
- Emily.

726
00:44:33,579 --> 00:44:36,082
How... how long do you think
you'll be with us?

727
00:44:36,097 --> 00:44:38,399
I... I hadn't really planned
it out, but I...

728
00:44:38,434 --> 00:44:40,833
was thinking, like... forever.

729
00:44:40,868 --> 00:44:43,604
Emily? Can I just speak to you
for a minute

730
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:46,402
in the, uh, kitchen, please?

731
00:44:49,041 --> 00:44:50,798
Are you crazy?
He cannot stay here.

732
00:44:50,845 --> 00:44:53,365
Clearly he has some serious issues.

733
00:44:53,379 --> 00:44:55,418
We can't just throw him out in
the snow.

734
00:44:55,437 --> 00:44:57,145
Why not? He loves the snow.

735
00:44:57,177 --> 00:44:58,571
He's told me 15 times.

736
00:44:58,639 --> 00:45:00,618
Walter, he's your son.

737
00:45:15,166 --> 00:45:16,827
Did you hear that?

738
00:45:18,083 --> 00:45:20,779
You are so weird.

739
00:45:22,361 --> 00:45:23,794
Dad?

740
00:45:26,924 --> 00:45:28,687
Dad?

741
00:45:29,787 --> 00:45:32,187
Dad!

742
00:45:33,151 --> 00:45:37,286
- What?
- I can't go to sleep unless I get tucked in.

743
00:45:38,255 --> 00:45:42,523
- What?
- I can't go to sleep unless I get tucked in.

744
00:45:43,761 --> 00:45:45,661
I am not gonna tuck you in.

745
00:45:45,696 --> 00:45:49,097
I... I promise I'll go right
to sleep.

746
00:45:50,907 --> 00:45:52,374
Fine.

747
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:02,110
- Tickle fight, tickle fight!
- Buddy, stop.

748
00:46:02,149 --> 00:46:04,150
- Tickle fight. Tickle...
- Stop, stop, stop.

749
00:46:04,202 --> 00:46:05,759
Sorry.

750
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:08,151
It's all right.

751
00:46:08,186 --> 00:46:09,085
Hey, uh...

752
00:46:09,719 --> 00:46:11,823
You just lay there and go to
sleep.

753
00:46:11,843 --> 00:46:14,272
- Okay.
- Okay.

754
00:46:15,005 --> 00:46:17,936
- Dad?
- Hmm?

755
00:46:19,383 --> 00:46:21,487
I love you.

756
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:27,080
Okay. Go to sleep now.

757
00:46:31,833 --> 00:46:33,414
Well, this is really something.

758
00:46:33,461 --> 00:46:37,795
I'm usually the one making
breakfast.

759
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:41,886
That's good, that's good.

760
00:46:43,018 --> 00:46:44,645
Okay.

761
00:46:51,792 --> 00:46:53,282
Oh, that's good.

762
00:46:53,335 --> 00:46:54,475
- Good?
- Good.

763
00:46:54,511 --> 00:46:55,776
Good.

764
00:46:56,243 --> 00:46:59,177
So, did you, um...

765
00:46:59,253 --> 00:47:00,855
Did you sleep okay last night?

766
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:03,383
Great. I got a full 40 minutes.

767
00:47:03,436 --> 00:47:06,036
And I had time to build that
rocking horse.

768
00:47:06,173 --> 00:47:10,244
Uh, oh, my gosh. You actually
made that?

769
00:47:10,279 --> 00:47:13,042
Where did you get all the wood?

770
00:47:23,249 --> 00:47:25,675
- Good morning, honey.
- Good morning, Dad.

771
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:28,561
Walter, Buddy has made us
breakfast.

772
00:47:28,596 --> 00:47:30,198
- Isn't that nice?
- Hm.

773
00:47:30,238 --> 00:47:31,898
And lunch.

774
00:47:31,977 --> 00:47:33,369
And lunch.

775
00:47:33,811 --> 00:47:34,665
Bye.

776
00:47:34,738 --> 00:47:36,128
So Dad, how many scoops?

777
00:47:36,471 --> 00:47:39,071
I'll stick with the coffee now,
thanks.

778
00:47:40,919 --> 00:47:42,079
So, Dad...

779
00:47:42,792 --> 00:47:43,841
I planned out our whole day.

780
00:47:43,876 --> 00:47:45,612
First, we'll make snow angels
for two hours,

781
00:47:45,639 --> 00:47:47,713
and then we'll go ice skating
and then we'll eat a whole roll

782
00:47:47,748 --> 00:47:49,782
of Tollhouse cookie dough as fast
as we can,

783
00:47:49,817 --> 00:47:52,117
and then, to finish, we'll snuggle.

784
00:47:53,032 --> 00:47:54,820
I've got to go to work, Buddy.

785
00:47:54,855 --> 00:47:56,020
Oh, and another thing...

786
00:47:56,055 --> 00:47:57,856
If you're going to be staying
here,

787
00:47:57,891 --> 00:47:59,658
you should think about, you know,

788
00:47:59,693 --> 00:48:01,325
getting rid of the costume.

789
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:02,693
But I've worn this my whole life.

790
00:48:04,088 --> 00:48:06,088
You're not on the North Pole any
longer.

791
00:48:06,148 --> 00:48:07,974
You wanna make me happy, don't you?

792
00:48:08,014 --> 00:48:09,008
More than anything.

793
00:48:09,048 --> 00:48:13,139
Then, lose the tights. I mean,
as soon as possible.

794
00:48:13,159 --> 00:48:14,692
As soon as possible?

795
00:48:14,721 --> 00:48:16,287
As soon as possible.

796
00:48:16,322 --> 00:48:17,686
Okay.

797
00:48:20,078 --> 00:48:21,279
I almost forgot...

798
00:48:21,314 --> 00:48:23,179
- Aah!
- Aah!

799
00:48:26,117 --> 00:48:27,811
Good morning.

800
00:48:32,289 --> 00:48:33,402
Walter here.

801
00:48:33,469 --> 00:48:35,475
It worked, it's you.

802
00:48:35,515 --> 00:48:36,589
How'd you get this number?

803
00:48:36,618 --> 00:48:38,482
Emily left an emergency list.

804
00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:39,282
I see.

805
00:48:39,322 --> 00:48:41,226
And, uh, is this an emergency?

806
00:48:41,266 --> 00:48:42,872
There's a horrible noise

807
00:48:42,899 --> 00:48:45,232
coming from the evil
box underneath the window.

808
00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:46,759
It sounds like this...

809
00:48:50,607 --> 00:48:53,130
It's, uh, it's... it's not evil,
Buddy,

810
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:54,575
it's, uh, it's a radiator,

811
00:48:54,610 --> 00:48:56,445
and the heat makes noise when
it comes on.

812
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:59,649
No, it doesn't. It... it's very
evil.

813
00:48:59,684 --> 00:49:02,963
It's scary to look at. It's...
okay...

814
00:49:03,003 --> 00:49:06,922
I'm going toward... oh, wait.
Yes, it is.

815
00:49:06,957 --> 00:49:08,409
Okay, it's okay. It's okay.

816
00:49:08,443 --> 00:49:09,763
Everything's fine.

817
00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:10,644
You were right.

818
00:49:10,683 --> 00:49:12,563
Okay, good, uh, I'm gonna hang
up now.

819
00:49:12,623 --> 00:49:13,761
I love you.

820
00:49:13,796 --> 00:49:15,481
I'll call you in five minutes.

821
00:49:15,516 --> 00:49:17,130
No, no, Buddy, don't, uh...

822
00:49:17,165 --> 00:49:19,701
you... you don't have to call me,
okay?

823
00:49:19,736 --> 00:49:21,267
Good idea, you call me.

824
00:49:21,302 --> 00:49:23,103
Okay. I'm gonna hang up now.

825
00:49:23,138 --> 00:49:24,973
I painted a picture of a
butterfly.

826
00:49:25,008 --> 00:49:26,936
Good. I'm gonna hang up now.

827
00:49:26,969 --> 00:49:28,187
<i>I tuned the piano.</i>

828
00:49:28,623 --> 00:49:30,430
Okay, I love you. Bye.

829
00:49:31,333 --> 00:49:33,286
Mmm...

830
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:51,765
Mmm.

831
00:49:52,573 --> 00:49:55,406
- Hobbs.
- Hey!

832
00:49:55,936 --> 00:49:57,369
- How you doing?
- Please, sit down.

833
00:49:58,230 --> 00:50:00,456
I haven't seen you since the retreat.
You're looking good.

834
00:50:00,501 --> 00:50:02,476
Oh, thank you very much.
You as well.

835
00:50:02,496 --> 00:50:04,010
To what do I owe the, uh,
pleasure?

836
00:50:04,056 --> 00:50:06,910
Well, to be honest, I got a call
from my niece.

837
00:50:07,456 --> 00:50:08,942
She wants to know

838
00:50:08,976 --> 00:50:11,689
how a certain puppy and a
certain pigeon

839
00:50:11,729 --> 00:50:15,539
escape the clutches of a
certain evil witch.

840
00:50:17,292 --> 00:50:18,259
Believe me, uh,

841
00:50:18,272 --> 00:50:19,877
we're already looking for new
printers.

842
00:50:19,892 --> 00:50:22,006
This one has obviously gotten a
little sloppy.

843
00:50:22,045 --> 00:50:24,563
Maybe it isn't the printer who's
gotten sloppy.

844
00:50:25,978 --> 00:50:27,905
That's your signature, right?

845
00:50:27,945 --> 00:50:30,105
You know, we could sit here and
point fingers all day.

846
00:50:30,136 --> 00:50:31,601
I've got news for you...

847
00:50:31,770 --> 00:50:34,306
Even if those two pages were
in there,

848
00:50:34,341 --> 00:50:36,136
the book still would have sucked.

849
00:50:36,183 --> 00:50:38,059
Have you seen the numbers for
this quarter?

850
00:50:38,094 --> 00:50:40,345
- Uh, they'll be here today.
- Oh, they're in.

851
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:43,480
That frigging puppy and pigeon
are tanking hard, Hobbs.

852
00:50:43,515 --> 00:50:47,250
My people estimate we're gonna post
a minus eight for this quarter.

853
00:50:47,581 --> 00:50:50,487
A minus eight! That does not
happen!

854
00:50:51,321 --> 00:50:53,001
You know, we'll... we'll bounce
back, we...

855
00:50:53,026 --> 00:50:54,776
- No, no, no.
- No? Well...

856
00:50:54,811 --> 00:50:56,321
We're gonna ship a new book.

857
00:50:56,347 --> 00:50:59,261
- The first quarter.
- First quarter?

858
00:50:59,502 --> 00:51:01,736
I'm gonna be back in town on
the 24th.

859
00:51:01,762 --> 00:51:04,409
At that time, I would love
to hear

860
00:51:04,469 --> 00:51:06,302
in exact detail

861
00:51:06,337 --> 00:51:09,534
what your plans are for this
new book.

862
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:13,437
Uh, wait a minute, the, uh
the 24th, that's Christmas Eve.

863
00:51:14,878 --> 00:51:15,844
And?

864
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:18,213
And, uh...

865
00:51:18,248 --> 00:51:21,284
No problem. Be great to have
you in the loop.

866
00:51:24,713 --> 00:51:27,887
All right, I got every
weapon in the game.

867
00:51:27,933 --> 00:51:29,533
I got full health, I got full
armour.

868
00:51:29,587 --> 00:51:30,453
Michael!

869
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,754
- I got full...
- Michael!

870
00:51:33,003 --> 00:51:34,971
It's me, Buddy!

871
00:51:35,832 --> 00:51:36,889
You know that guy?

872
00:51:36,936 --> 00:51:38,969
No, I've never seen him before.

873
00:51:38,996 --> 00:51:41,930
It's me, Buddy! Your brother!

874
00:51:42,112 --> 00:51:43,443
Oh, man.

875
00:51:44,125 --> 00:51:48,510
No, Michael! Wait! It's your
brother, Bud... aaah!

876
00:51:49,444 --> 00:51:52,072
Sorry. Sorry!

877
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:55,009
Michael! Michael!

878
00:51:55,224 --> 00:51:56,804
Michael!

879
00:51:56,839 --> 00:51:58,676
Michael, wait up!

880
00:51:58,696 --> 00:52:01,209
Michael! Michael!

881
00:52:01,589 --> 00:52:03,389
Wow, you're fast.

882
00:52:03,462 --> 00:52:04,643
I'm glad I caught up to you.

883
00:52:04,678 --> 00:52:06,253
I waited five hours for you.

884
00:52:06,288 --> 00:52:07,793
Why is your coat so big?

885
00:52:07,828 --> 00:52:10,314
So, good news... I saw a dog
today.

886
00:52:10,349 --> 00:52:12,800
Have you seen a dog?
You probably have.

887
00:52:12,835 --> 00:52:14,915
How was school? Was it fun?

888
00:52:14,955 --> 00:52:16,801
Did you get a lot of
homework, huh?

889
00:52:16,868 --> 00:52:18,018
Do you have any friends?

890
00:52:18,048 --> 00:52:19,321
Do you have a best friend?

891
00:52:19,335 --> 00:52:22,108
- Does he have a big coat, too?
- Go away!

892
00:52:23,330 --> 00:52:27,460
Ow! Son of a nutcracker!

893
00:52:30,178 --> 00:52:31,610
Run!

894
00:52:32,352 --> 00:52:35,822
Get him! Get the green guy!

895
00:52:42,642 --> 00:52:45,378
Oh, no. These guys are bad news.

896
00:52:46,255 --> 00:52:48,152
We better get outta here.

897
00:52:49,469 --> 00:52:51,970
You know what? We can take 'em.

898
00:52:52,005 --> 00:52:55,997
Okay, just start making as
many snowballs as you can.

899
00:53:04,015 --> 00:53:05,515
You ready?

900
00:53:06,452 --> 00:53:07,868
Let's go.

901
00:53:10,456 --> 00:53:11,855
Ow!

902
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:18,280
Run!

903
00:53:21,363 --> 00:53:24,863
Ooh!

904
00:53:26,571 --> 00:53:29,022
Oh, man. One got away.

905
00:53:29,049 --> 00:53:30,311
Snowball.

906
00:53:40,726 --> 00:53:41,946
Wow.

907
00:53:43,786 --> 00:53:45,560
Where did you say you were from?

908
00:53:46,937 --> 00:53:48,497
<i>♪ Oh, yeah ♪</i>

909
00:53:48,538 --> 00:53:51,241
<i>♪ Candles burning low ♪</i>

910
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:54,311
<i>♪ Lots of mistletoe ♪</i>

911
00:53:54,364 --> 00:53:59,868
<i>♪ Lots of snow and ice
Everywhere we go ♪</i>

912
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:05,442
<i>♪ Choirs singing carols
Right outside my door ♪</i>

913
00:54:05,477 --> 00:54:07,445
<i>♪ All these things and more ♪</i>

914
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:09,240
I wish Dad were here.

915
00:54:09,294 --> 00:54:10,480
Why?

916
00:54:10,492 --> 00:54:13,013
'Cause he's the greatest dad in
the whole wide world.

917
00:54:13,253 --> 00:54:14,482
Are you kidding?

918
00:54:14,517 --> 00:54:17,086
He's the worst dad in the world.

919
00:54:17,121 --> 00:54:18,062
What do you mean?

920
00:54:18,109 --> 00:54:19,842
All he does is work.

921
00:54:20,217 --> 00:54:21,582
Working's fun.

922
00:54:22,091 --> 00:54:23,916
Not the way he does it.

923
00:54:23,982 --> 00:54:25,363
All he cares about is money.

924
00:54:25,409 --> 00:54:29,126
He doesn't care about you,
or me, or anybody.

925
00:54:29,153 --> 00:54:32,097
Well, he is on the Naughty list.

926
00:54:36,738 --> 00:54:38,601
You like her?

927
00:54:38,636 --> 00:54:40,464
Like who?

928
00:54:40,608 --> 00:54:42,074
The girl you're staring at.

929
00:54:42,119 --> 00:54:43,634
Oh, uh...

930
00:54:43,669 --> 00:54:45,383
yeah.

931
00:54:47,282 --> 00:54:49,179
Why don't you ask her out?

932
00:54:49,205 --> 00:54:50,136
Out?

933
00:54:50,432 --> 00:54:53,399
You know, on a date...
to eat food.

934
00:54:53,457 --> 00:54:54,032
Food?

935
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:56,815
Yes, real food, not candy.

936
00:54:57,077 --> 00:54:59,550
And if she says yes, you're in.

937
00:54:59,588 --> 00:55:02,203
It's like a secret code
girls have.

938
00:55:03,924 --> 00:55:05,926
Well, look who it is.

939
00:55:06,168 --> 00:55:09,261
- Hi, Jovie.
- Hi.

940
00:55:11,144 --> 00:55:12,691
Oh, uh, this is Michael.

941
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,312
I'm his brother.

942
00:55:15,382 --> 00:55:16,381
Hi.

943
00:55:16,643 --> 00:55:18,444
So, what are you doing here?

944
00:55:18,479 --> 00:55:21,063
Did Gimbel's give you your
job back?

945
00:55:21,098 --> 00:55:23,344
No. But things worked out
pretty good.

946
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:25,427
They gave me a restraining
order.

947
00:55:25,817 --> 00:55:29,491
Well, um, you should probably
get outta here.

948
00:55:29,531 --> 00:55:32,397
Ho ho ho!

949
00:55:32,725 --> 00:55:35,657
But... I really wanted to
see you,

950
00:55:35,697 --> 00:55:39,065
and... and I think you're
beautiful, and I, um...

951
00:55:39,206 --> 00:55:42,113
I feel really warm when I
am around you,

952
00:55:42,163 --> 00:55:46,427
and, um, my tongue swells up.

953
00:55:50,769 --> 00:55:52,999
So...

954
00:55:53,345 --> 00:55:55,540
do you wanna go eat food?

955
00:55:55,707 --> 00:55:58,010
Do I... do I wanna eat food?

956
00:55:58,065 --> 00:55:58,996
Mm-hmm.

957
00:55:59,518 --> 00:56:04,820
You know, uh, the code... "food".

958
00:56:06,558 --> 00:56:09,685
Well, I just had my lunch break.

959
00:56:09,926 --> 00:56:12,745
Oh, okay. I understand.

960
00:56:12,914 --> 00:56:15,699
But I'm free on Thursday.

961
00:56:16,419 --> 00:56:17,939
Thursday! Thursday!

962
00:56:17,994 --> 00:56:20,163
Come on. That'd be great.

963
00:56:20,658 --> 00:56:21,589
All right.

964
00:56:22,033 --> 00:56:24,919
- Was that okay?
- You did great, man.

965
00:56:26,243 --> 00:56:27,243
What should we put on it first?

966
00:56:27,283 --> 00:56:28,996
- Lights!
- Oh, good.

967
00:56:29,442 --> 00:56:30,056
And then, after that?

968
00:56:30,093 --> 00:56:32,960
- Ornaments!
- Ornaments, okay.

969
00:56:34,150 --> 00:56:36,986
- What the hell's that?
- A Christmas tree.

970
00:56:37,021 --> 00:56:38,219
A Christmas tree?

971
00:56:38,487 --> 00:56:41,615
Buddy chopped it down in
the park.

972
00:56:42,058 --> 00:56:43,491
Emily.

973
00:56:44,064 --> 00:56:46,131
I don't know what you're making
such a big deal about.

974
00:56:46,178 --> 00:56:48,257
They were just having a
little fun.

975
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:50,231
Oh, fun? So felonies are
fun now?

976
00:56:50,266 --> 00:56:52,763
I thought, see, felonies
were felonies.

977
00:56:52,803 --> 00:56:54,035
Okay, the tree thing was bad.

978
00:56:54,070 --> 00:56:55,336
I'll get him to plant
another one.

979
00:56:55,371 --> 00:56:57,973
But at least Michael is
happy for once.

980
00:56:58,694 --> 00:57:00,681
What, uh, what's that supposed
to mean?

981
00:57:00,722 --> 00:57:02,868
Well, I don't think it's any
secret, Walter,

982
00:57:02,913 --> 00:57:05,180
that you haven't exactly been
there for him.

983
00:57:05,635 --> 00:57:06,894
I'll tell you what, why don't
we just

984
00:57:06,914 --> 00:57:08,708
pull him outta school and let
the, uh,

985
00:57:08,741 --> 00:57:10,384
deranged elf man raise him?

986
00:57:10,654 --> 00:57:13,255
Then they can have lots of
fun committing felonies.

987
00:57:13,290 --> 00:57:15,813
How are we gonna get the star
on top?

988
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:17,383
I got it.

989
00:57:29,804 --> 00:57:30,903
I mean, what are we gonna do?

990
00:57:30,938 --> 00:57:33,107
We can't... we can't leave him
alone here.

991
00:57:33,142 --> 00:57:35,632
He's gonna destroy the place.

992
00:57:37,678 --> 00:57:38,377
Why don't you, um...

993
00:57:38,412 --> 00:57:39,712
why don't you take off tomorrow?

994
00:57:39,747 --> 00:57:41,949
You know, and you could stay
home and watch him?

995
00:57:41,984 --> 00:57:44,000
Oh, no. No, I can't stay home
tomorrow,

996
00:57:44,033 --> 00:57:45,353
I have a budget meeting tomorrow.

997
00:57:45,672 --> 00:57:47,273
Well, honey, I can't take off,

998
00:57:47,306 --> 00:57:50,422
I'm one... one bad pitch away
from getting fired... one.

999
00:57:50,457 --> 00:57:52,837
Well, I tell you what, I have
an idea then.

1000
00:57:52,858 --> 00:57:55,742
Why don't you take Buddy to
work with you?

1001
00:58:03,637 --> 00:58:05,323
- Hey, Walter.
- Morning, Jack.

1002
00:58:05,399 --> 00:58:07,025
Morning, Jack.

1003
00:58:07,803 --> 00:58:09,040
Oh, good morning, Mr. Hobbs.

1004
00:58:09,075 --> 00:58:11,030
- Good morning, Sarah.
- Good morning, Sarah.

1005
00:58:11,050 --> 00:58:13,947
That's a nice purple dress.
It's very purple-y.

1006
00:58:13,987 --> 00:58:15,007
- Francisco.
- How's it going, Mr. Hobbs?

1007
00:58:15,026 --> 00:58:18,167
Francisco, that's fun to say...
"Francisco".

1008
00:58:20,179 --> 00:58:21,673
- Hi!
- Hi.

1009
00:58:21,754 --> 00:58:22,501
Do you remember me?

1010
00:58:22,514 --> 00:58:23,593
I do. I didn't recognize you.

1011
00:58:23,638 --> 00:58:25,518
I know, I'm in work clothes.

1012
00:58:29,882 --> 00:58:31,884
Thank you, Deborah.

1013
00:58:31,919 --> 00:58:32,916
Thanks, Deb.

1014
00:58:32,951 --> 00:58:34,102
Deb, you have such a pretty face.

1015
00:58:34,128 --> 00:58:35,815
You should be on a Christmas card.

1016
00:58:35,868 --> 00:58:38,301
You just made my day.

1017
00:58:45,423 --> 00:58:46,890
Eww.

1018
00:58:50,348 --> 00:58:51,547
- Buddy.
- Hmm?

1019
00:58:51,582 --> 00:58:53,106
You don't have to drink that.

1020
00:58:53,139 --> 00:58:54,628
Thank you.

1021
00:59:04,795 --> 00:59:06,786
Francisco.

1022
00:59:08,117 --> 00:59:10,642
Francisco.

1023
00:59:11,769 --> 00:59:13,554
Francisco.

1024
00:59:13,922 --> 00:59:15,530
Francisco.

1025
00:59:15,632 --> 00:59:17,206
Buddy?

1026
00:59:17,785 --> 00:59:19,136
Am I too loud?

1027
00:59:19,189 --> 00:59:20,523
Just... just a little.

1028
00:59:20,567 --> 00:59:21,723
Sorry!

1029
00:59:28,331 --> 00:59:29,583
Yes, Bud?

1030
00:59:29,703 --> 00:59:31,854
Why is your name on the desk?

1031
00:59:32,344 --> 00:59:33,924
I bought the desk.

1032
00:59:33,962 --> 00:59:36,760
My name's there so no one
steals it.

1033
00:59:38,694 --> 00:59:40,512
That's a joke, isn't it, Dad?

1034
00:59:40,547 --> 00:59:43,053
Yeah, Buddy, that's a joke.

1035
00:59:43,103 --> 00:59:45,662
So, what are we gonna build?

1036
00:59:45,770 --> 00:59:48,223
No, uh, we don't do
that kind of work here, pal.

1037
00:59:50,517 --> 00:59:52,017
Buddy the elf, what's your
favourite colour?

1038
00:59:52,064 --> 00:59:53,742
Put that down. Hello?

1039
00:59:54,004 --> 00:59:56,108
Hello?

1040
00:59:57,718 --> 00:59:59,250
Please, don't touch anything.

1041
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:01,348
Sorry.

1042
01:00:04,619 --> 01:00:06,086
Hey...

1043
01:00:08,185 --> 01:00:10,024
Bud, have you... have you...

1044
01:00:10,059 --> 01:00:11,725
have you ever seen a mail room?

1045
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:12,973
A mail room? No.

1046
01:00:13,012 --> 01:00:14,032
- No?
- No.

1047
01:00:14,072 --> 01:00:15,918
Oh, I mean, wow.

1048
01:00:15,958 --> 01:00:18,165
Wow... listen, it's a
place where

1049
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:19,724
mail from all over the world comes.

1050
01:00:19,771 --> 01:00:21,902
- Uh-huh.
- And they sort it out there, see?

1051
01:00:21,937 --> 01:00:22,868
And you can touch it all,

1052
01:00:22,903 --> 01:00:24,377
and they put it in these
shiny bins.

1053
01:00:24,430 --> 01:00:25,970
- Shiny bins?
- Right.

1054
01:00:26,012 --> 01:00:28,230
- What do ya think?
- It sounds great.

1055
01:00:28,258 --> 01:00:29,255
Good.

1056
01:00:29,843 --> 01:00:31,345
Can we go there?

1057
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:32,532
Well, um...

1058
01:00:32,585 --> 01:00:34,892
I gotta work here, maybe... maybe
you can work there.

1059
01:00:34,939 --> 01:00:36,212
Okay, I'll work there.

1060
01:00:39,625 --> 01:00:41,387
Oh, I don't think this is
the place

1061
01:00:41,415 --> 01:00:42,458
my dad was talking about.

1062
01:00:42,494 --> 01:00:43,996
Is there a different mail room?

1063
01:00:44,011 --> 01:00:46,078
No. This is the only one.

1064
01:00:46,093 --> 01:00:48,288
It's not very shiny.

1065
01:00:48,761 --> 01:00:52,764
Now... over here's the trench.

1066
01:00:52,799 --> 01:00:54,899
All the mail comes out that
shooter.

1067
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:58,840
Scan and find the floor each
piece is moving to.

1068
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:00,547
Put it in a canister

1069
01:01:00,587 --> 01:01:03,942
and shove it up the tube with
the same number.

1070
01:01:03,977 --> 01:01:05,394
You got that?

1071
01:01:05,429 --> 01:01:06,777
I think so.

1072
01:01:06,812 --> 01:01:09,781
This place reminds me of
Santa's workshop.

1073
01:01:09,816 --> 01:01:11,314
Except it smells like mushrooms,

1074
01:01:11,349 --> 01:01:14,375
and everyone looks like they
wanna hurt me.

1075
01:01:14,872 --> 01:01:16,453
Uh, Greenway's coming in tomorrow,

1076
01:01:16,493 --> 01:01:18,255
so, what... what do we got?

1077
01:01:18,419 --> 01:01:20,879
Well, Morris and I have been
brainstorming,

1078
01:01:20,946 --> 01:01:23,850
and we've come up with what I
think is a pretty big idea.

1079
01:01:23,884 --> 01:01:24,728
Great, what?

1080
01:01:24,763 --> 01:01:26,737
You're gonna love it, it's
fantastic.

1081
01:01:26,793 --> 01:01:27,724
What?

1082
01:01:27,819 --> 01:01:31,121
Okay, picture this...

1083
01:01:31,702 --> 01:01:34,969
we bring in Miles Finch.

1084
01:01:35,806 --> 01:01:37,391
The Miles Finch?

1085
01:01:37,426 --> 01:01:38,635
"The Golden Ghost".

1086
01:01:38,670 --> 01:01:40,130
We bring him in!

1087
01:01:40,177 --> 01:01:42,713
He's written more
classics than Dr. Seuss.

1088
01:01:42,895 --> 01:01:45,347
It ain't gonna be easy,
but I think it's worth a shot.

1089
01:01:46,415 --> 01:01:50,148
My two top writers, my crack team,
my fun squad...

1090
01:01:50,202 --> 01:01:53,848
you came in here pitching me
the idea of hiring another writer?

1091
01:01:53,898 --> 01:01:57,105
- Yeah.
- Miles Finch.

1092
01:02:00,143 --> 01:02:01,976
I like it.

1093
01:02:03,933 --> 01:02:04,866
I like it.

1094
01:02:04,901 --> 01:02:08,137
Then I travelled through the seven
levels of the Candy Cane Forest...

1095
01:02:08,204 --> 01:02:12,242
and past the Sea of Swirly-Twirly
Gumdrops.

1096
01:02:12,537 --> 01:02:14,708
Ooh!

1097
01:02:14,743 --> 01:02:17,778
Wow... it's sucky.

1098
01:02:17,813 --> 01:02:20,265
Ohh, it's wonderful. Yes!

1099
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:22,718
That is marvellous how that...

1100
01:02:24,519 --> 01:02:26,479
Oh, it's very sucky.

1101
01:02:26,519 --> 01:02:29,004
It's very... sucky.

1102
01:02:29,093 --> 01:02:30,358
Whoo.

1103
01:02:30,893 --> 01:02:32,413
So, how'd you get here?

1104
01:02:32,462 --> 01:02:33,895
Work release.

1105
01:02:33,990 --> 01:02:35,055
Mm.

1106
01:02:35,364 --> 01:02:37,898
Oh, syrup and coffee?

1107
01:02:38,417 --> 01:02:40,770
Why didn't I think of that? Can I
try some?

1108
01:02:40,830 --> 01:02:41,928
Be my guest.

1109
01:02:42,196 --> 01:02:43,663
Very generous of you.

1110
01:02:44,298 --> 01:02:48,308
Mmm. I love syrup.

1111
01:02:49,871 --> 01:02:52,066
Ohh, I love it.

1112
01:02:53,748 --> 01:02:55,715
Mmm...

1113
01:02:55,750 --> 01:02:59,518
You know, I know I sound like a
broken record, but we are buddies.

1114
01:02:59,874 --> 01:03:02,387
You're my best friend, that's it.
You're my best friend.

1115
01:03:02,427 --> 01:03:05,420
You know, Buddy, nobody around
here listens to me.

1116
01:03:05,447 --> 01:03:07,620
- I got really good ideas.
- Yeah? I believe it.

1117
01:03:07,667 --> 01:03:10,395
I know, I'm right, I listen to you.
You have great ideas.

1118
01:03:10,430 --> 01:03:12,332
I just try to go with the flow,
you know?

1119
01:03:12,353 --> 01:03:13,145
Good, you go with the flow.

1120
01:03:13,192 --> 01:03:14,566
- Yeah.
- Go with the flow.

1121
01:03:14,601 --> 01:03:17,335
- No, I gotta get out of the flow.
- Well, then get out of the flow.

1122
01:03:17,370 --> 01:03:18,536
I'm in the flow, that's what got
me here.

1123
01:03:18,571 --> 01:03:21,629
I gotta... I'm 26 years old, I got
nothing to show for it.

1124
01:03:21,669 --> 01:03:23,956
You're young. You're so young.

1125
01:03:24,696 --> 01:03:25,777
- My Papa...
- Yeah?

1126
01:03:25,812 --> 01:03:30,449
He didn't make Master Tinker 'til
he was 490, so...

1127
01:03:33,319 --> 01:03:35,054
- Four-hundred and ninety?
- Yeah.

1128
01:03:36,965 --> 01:03:39,057
Tickle fight! Tickle fight!

1129
01:03:39,092 --> 01:03:41,979
Tickle fight! Tickle fight!

1130
01:03:42,052 --> 01:03:45,064
My favourite book of yours has
gotta be "Gus' Pickles".

1131
01:03:45,332 --> 01:03:49,052
It's existential, yet it's so
accessible.

1132
01:03:49,105 --> 01:03:51,972
Uh, Mr. Finch, uh, Eugene Dupris
here.

1133
01:03:52,038 --> 01:03:55,305
It's a thrill just to be talking
to you on our speaker-phone.

1134
01:03:55,340 --> 01:03:58,816
Miles, um, so, what do you think?
Can you fly in tomorrow?

1135
01:03:58,876 --> 01:04:00,611
<i>I'll give you five hours tomorrow,</i>

1136
01:04:00,646 --> 01:04:01,811
<i>Not a minute more.</i>

1137
01:04:01,846 --> 01:04:02,926
Oh, that's... that's great.

1138
01:04:03,414 --> 01:04:06,551
<i>I'd like a black S500 to receive
me at the airport.</i>

1139
01:04:06,586 --> 01:04:08,353
<i>I need the interior of that car</i>

1140
01:04:08,388 --> 01:04:10,353
<i>to be 71 degrees exactly.</i>

1141
01:04:10,388 --> 01:04:12,123
- We can do that.
<i>- Mr. Hobbs?</i>

1142
01:04:12,158 --> 01:04:14,213
<i>There's a situation downstairs.</i>

1143
01:04:14,252 --> 01:04:15,066
<i>I'm sorry, what?</i>

1144
01:04:15,092 --> 01:04:16,806
No, hold on, Miles. Deb, hang up.

1145
01:04:16,859 --> 01:04:19,059
<i>I do not hold. Do not put
me on hold.</i>

1146
01:04:19,099 --> 01:04:20,773
<i>We have a problem in the
mail room.</i>

1147
01:04:20,806 --> 01:04:21,745
What's going on?

1148
01:04:21,779 --> 01:04:23,412
Don't speak... Deborah, hang up!

1149
01:04:23,439 --> 01:04:26,002
<i>- That's it, I'm gone.</i>
- Miles!

1150
01:04:29,618 --> 01:04:32,525
<i>I'll be there tomorrow...
71 degrees.</i>

1151
01:04:32,578 --> 01:04:35,546
<i>Sir, Chuck in the mail room
needs to talk to you.</i>

1152
01:04:35,581 --> 01:04:36,979
Chuck... what, Chuck?

1153
01:04:37,014 --> 01:04:38,513
I mean, what could be going on
down there

1154
01:04:38,548 --> 01:04:40,583
that's so important you had to
interrupt me, what?

Hi.

1172
01:05:18,397 --> 01:05:19,638
Wow.

1173
01:05:19,687 --> 01:05:21,422
You look miraculous.

1174
01:05:21,490 --> 01:05:22,824
So do you.

1175
01:05:22,851 --> 01:05:24,018
Thank you.

1176
01:05:24,098 --> 01:05:26,100
What would you like to do?

1177
01:05:26,269 --> 01:05:28,326
I got some ideas.

1178
01:05:33,205 --> 01:05:36,503
Just reach out in front of you and
and take a sip.

1179
01:05:36,718 --> 01:05:40,141
Don't look. There you go.

1180
01:05:41,682 --> 01:05:43,149
Well?

1181
01:05:44,235 --> 01:05:46,647
It tastes like a crappy cup
of coffee.

1182
01:05:47,089 --> 01:05:48,911
No.

1183
01:05:50,484 --> 01:05:52,184
It is a crappy cup of coffee.

1184
01:05:52,219 --> 01:05:54,685
No, it's the world's best cup
of coffee.

1185
01:05:55,444 --> 01:05:58,458
The trick is to not get your arm caught
in the door!

1186
01:05:58,753 --> 01:06:01,959
Also, never close your eyes' cause
then you'll get sick!

1187
01:06:01,994 --> 01:06:05,665
Okay, when you feel comfortable, you
just jump in!

1188
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:07,398
What are you doing?

1189
01:06:07,433 --> 01:06:10,486
I'm skipping. I'm skipping.
I'm skipping.

1190
01:06:10,521 --> 01:06:13,127
Wait, wait, wait... one more, one more.

1191
01:06:13,167 --> 01:06:15,087
Now, look at the size of this one.

1192
01:06:21,746 --> 01:06:23,611
Come with me.

1193
01:06:24,208 --> 01:06:25,189
Watch out.

1194
01:06:25,230 --> 01:06:26,975
Yellow ones don't stop.

1195
01:06:26,996 --> 01:06:28,993
The yellow ones don't stop.

1196
01:06:35,127 --> 01:06:39,257
Wow... that's a big one.

1197
01:07:00,017 --> 01:07:01,368
I'm sorry.

1198
01:07:01,403 --> 01:07:02,685
You missed.

1199
01:07:03,168 --> 01:07:05,637
- What do you mean I missed?
- You missed.

1200
01:07:25,822 --> 01:07:28,424
- Miles Finch.
- Miles Finch.

1201
01:07:30,586 --> 01:07:32,486
Miles Finch.

1202
01:07:35,490 --> 01:07:37,423
All right, let's do this.

1203
01:07:37,490 --> 01:07:39,577
Miles, I'm so happy you could come,
uh...

1204
01:07:39,635 --> 01:07:40,135
Yeah.

1205
01:07:40,143 --> 01:07:42,391
- I'm Walter Hobbs.
- Yeah, let's get the, uh...

1206
01:07:42,426 --> 01:07:44,702
taken care of so we can get started
here.

1207
01:07:44,741 --> 01:07:46,435
Here you go.

1208
01:07:48,482 --> 01:07:49,696
Great.

1209
01:07:50,035 --> 01:07:52,217
All right...

1210
01:07:52,252 --> 01:07:54,702
What have you guys got so far?

1211
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:56,037
Go ahead.

1212
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:57,303
Uh...

1213
01:07:57,338 --> 01:08:00,575
We were thinking, uh, something
like this, uh...

1214
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:02,542
we open on a young tomato.

1215
01:08:02,577 --> 01:08:04,712
He's had some tough times down
at the farm

1216
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:06,187
with, you know, rabbits, and...

1217
01:08:06,253 --> 01:08:08,686
No. No tomatoes...

1218
01:08:08,733 --> 01:08:09,861
too vulnerable.

1219
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:11,268
Kids, they're already vulnerable.

1220
01:08:11,303 --> 01:08:12,996
No, you see?
I... I told you guys.

1221
01:08:13,031 --> 01:08:14,689
I told them the very same thing...

1222
01:08:14,724 --> 01:08:15,321
And no farms.

1223
01:08:15,356 --> 01:08:17,792
Everybody's pushing small-town
rural.

1224
01:08:17,827 --> 01:08:19,835
A farm book would just be white
noise.

1225
01:08:19,881 --> 01:08:21,059
What about this?

1226
01:08:21,094 --> 01:08:24,428
Uh, a tribe of asparagus children,

1227
01:08:24,482 --> 01:08:28,727
but they're self-conscious about
the way their pee smells.

1228
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:35,775
Apparently, all we have is
vegetables.

1229
01:08:35,810 --> 01:08:37,060
I have no time, so... you know,

1230
01:08:37,095 --> 01:08:38,276
if you've got a story here...

1231
01:08:38,311 --> 01:08:41,114
I've got about five or six great
starts here.

1232
01:08:41,149 --> 01:08:43,182
I've got one idea that
I'm especially

1233
01:08:43,217 --> 01:08:45,401
psyched out of my mind about.

1234
01:08:45,735 --> 01:08:49,154
You know, it's one of those ideas
where you're just like, uh...

1235
01:08:49,189 --> 01:08:50,054
Yes!

1236
01:08:50,089 --> 01:08:52,289
Whoa!

1237
01:08:52,990 --> 01:08:55,084
Uh, great, c-could we hear it?

1238
01:08:55,137 --> 01:08:58,097
I'll start with the cover.
Picture this... you got, uh...

1239
01:08:58,132 --> 01:09:00,867
Dad! I'm in love, I'm in love,

1240
01:09:00,902 --> 01:09:03,602
and I don't care who knows it!

1241
01:09:03,637 --> 01:09:05,289
Buddy, not now, uh,

1242
01:09:05,336 --> 01:09:07,129
can you please go back to the...
to the pit?

1243
01:09:07,147 --> 01:09:09,349
I'll come and visit you in a
little while, okay?

1244
01:09:09,395 --> 01:09:12,375
I didn't know you had elves
working here.

1245
01:09:12,410 --> 01:09:17,315
Oh... boy, you're... you're hilarious,
my friend.

1246
01:09:17,350 --> 01:09:19,582
He doesn't, uh... get back to

1247
01:09:19,617 --> 01:09:22,287
- the story, please.
- All right, okay.

1248
01:09:23,421 --> 01:09:25,275
So, on the cover above the title...

1249
01:09:25,315 --> 01:09:27,667
Does Santa know that you left the
workshop?

1250
01:09:27,701 --> 01:09:29,778
You know, we're all laughing our
heads off.

1251
01:09:29,821 --> 01:09:31,568
Did you have to borrow a reindeer
to get down here?

1252
01:09:31,595 --> 01:09:33,630
Buddy... go back to the basement.

1253
01:09:33,658 --> 01:09:34,978
Hey, jackweed,

1254
01:09:35,018 --> 01:09:38,631
I get more action in a week
than you've had your entire life.

1255
01:09:38,691 --> 01:09:41,805
I've got houses in L.A., Paris,
and Vail,

1256
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:42,898
- Oh.
- each one of them

1257
01:09:42,918 --> 01:09:45,242
with a 70-inch plasma screen.

1258
01:09:45,450 --> 01:09:48,110
So, I suggest you wipe
that stupid smile off your face

1259
01:09:48,145 --> 01:09:50,457
before I come over there and smack
it off!

1260
01:09:50,521 --> 01:09:52,154
You feeling strong, my friend?!

1261
01:09:52,210 --> 01:09:55,610
Call me elf one more time!

1262
01:10:00,209 --> 01:10:01,809
He's an angry elf.

1263
01:10:06,181 --> 01:10:08,262
Look at you.

1264
01:10:09,705 --> 01:10:11,501
Ow! Hey, what...

1265
01:10:11,550 --> 01:10:12,280
Aah!

1266
01:10:12,968 --> 01:10:14,407
I wasn't ready for that.

1267
01:10:14,434 --> 01:10:15,747
Aah! Hey, hey, hey!

1268
01:10:15,784 --> 01:10:18,001
Hey, hey, hey! Whoa!

1269
01:10:18,549 --> 01:10:19,200
Ooh...

1270
01:10:19,421 --> 01:10:21,227
Call me elf one more time!

1271
01:10:21,311 --> 01:10:23,057
Call me elf!

1272
01:10:23,091 --> 01:10:24,802
You're an elf.

1273
01:10:31,570 --> 01:10:34,195
Miles, I'm sorry, he... he thinks
he's an elf.

1274
01:10:34,582 --> 01:10:35,664
Listen, Miles...

1275
01:10:35,936 --> 01:10:37,504
Listen, Miles!

1276
01:10:37,851 --> 01:10:40,316
He must be a South Pole elf.

1277
01:10:43,077 --> 01:10:44,761
You get the hell outta here.

1278
01:10:45,084 --> 01:10:46,392
Where do you want me to go?

1279
01:10:46,593 --> 01:10:47,832
I don't care where you go.

1280
01:10:47,987 --> 01:10:49,078
I don't care that you're an elf!

1281
01:10:49,117 --> 01:10:50,438
I don't care that you're nuts!

1282
01:10:50,486 --> 01:10:52,186
I don't care that you're my son!

1283
01:10:52,508 --> 01:10:55,408
Get out of my life... now!

1284
01:11:05,853 --> 01:11:06,852
<i>Hi, it's me.</i>

1285
01:11:06,887 --> 01:11:08,419
<i>I really can't talk right now.</i>

1286
01:11:08,454 --> 01:11:11,550
Well, just tell me
how the pitch went.

1287
01:11:11,630 --> 01:11:13,550
I'm gonna be a little later than
I thought, okay?

1288
01:11:13,561 --> 01:11:15,597
Well, don't be too late, Walter,

1289
01:11:15,630 --> 01:11:17,347
it's Christmas Eve.

1290
01:11:17,428 --> 01:11:19,076
- Walter...
- Wait, um.

1291
01:11:19,265 --> 01:11:21,401
Honey, I gotta go, okay? Love ya.

1292
01:11:21,436 --> 01:11:23,562
<i>Oh, say "hi" to Buddy.</i>

1293
01:11:24,437 --> 01:11:26,305
- What?
- Walter, breakthrough.

1294
01:11:26,345 --> 01:11:28,092
We found this in the
conference room.

1295
01:11:28,145 --> 01:11:28,773
What is it?

1296
01:11:28,808 --> 01:11:30,612
It's Miles Finch's notebook.

1297
01:11:30,658 --> 01:11:33,598
This thing is chock full of
genius ideas.

1298
01:11:33,658 --> 01:11:35,112
I mean, look at that.

1299
01:11:35,172 --> 01:11:38,638
And his best idea is about a
peach that lives on a farm.

1300
01:11:38,672 --> 01:11:40,571
What's more vulnerable than a
peach?

1301
01:11:40,605 --> 01:11:41,965
What, uh, what do we do?

1302
01:11:42,018 --> 01:11:44,338
I think we should go with the
first pitch... it's genius.

1303
01:11:44,405 --> 01:11:45,651
Uh, how much time we got?

1304
01:11:45,684 --> 01:11:47,292
- We got, like, 45 minutes.
- Well, come on, let's, uh,

1305
01:11:47,327 --> 01:11:49,294
try to get a storyboard or
something ready.

1306
01:11:49,329 --> 01:11:51,022
- Come on, let's do it.
- Just try.

1307
01:11:51,055 --> 01:11:52,948
No, you can't sit down and get a
storyboard ready.

1308
01:11:52,995 --> 01:11:53,982
Go and get a storyboard ready.

1309
01:11:54,022 --> 01:11:56,242
Okay. Go.

1310
01:11:59,809 --> 01:12:03,038
<i>"I'm sorry I ruined your lives</i>

1311
01:12:03,073 --> 01:12:07,977
<i>"and crammed 11 cookies into
the VCR.</i>

1312
01:12:08,972 --> 01:12:13,416
<i>"I don't belong here. I don't
belong anywhere.</i>

1313
01:12:14,351 --> 01:12:19,045
<i>"I'll never forget you. Love,
Buddy."</i>

1314
01:12:19,071 --> 01:12:20,469
God...

1315
01:12:31,561 --> 01:12:33,085
Hey, Buddy.

1316
01:12:35,705 --> 01:12:37,172
Buddy?

1317
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:45,547
As you know, we need a big
launch fast

1318
01:12:45,582 --> 01:12:47,653
to get the company back on
track.

1319
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:50,152
So, I think I speak for my fellow
board members

1320
01:12:50,187 --> 01:12:53,322
when I say... this better be good.

1321
01:12:54,623 --> 01:12:56,777
Before I get into the story, uh,

1322
01:12:56,843 --> 01:12:58,460
let me start with the cover, okay?

1323
01:12:58,495 --> 01:13:00,410
Now, just picture this...

1324
01:13:00,457 --> 01:13:02,374
Dad! I gotta talk to you.

1325
01:13:03,003 --> 01:13:04,296
Michael, what is it?

1326
01:13:04,334 --> 01:13:05,532
Buddy ran away.

1327
01:13:05,754 --> 01:13:08,139
- What?
- He... he left a note.

1328
01:13:08,583 --> 01:13:10,902
I'm scared, Dad, he's gone.

1329
01:13:11,196 --> 01:13:13,140
Uh, let me just finish this
meeting,

1330
01:13:13,175 --> 01:13:15,575
and then, um, we'll figure it
out, okay?

1331
01:13:15,610 --> 01:13:20,014
Figure out what? Buddy cares
about everybody.

1332
01:13:20,049 --> 01:13:22,175
All you care about is yourself.

1333
01:13:23,598 --> 01:13:24,771
Hey, Michael.

1334
01:13:26,554 --> 01:13:28,021
Wait.

1335
01:13:32,945 --> 01:13:35,499
We're gonna have to reschedule
this, uh, Mr. Greenway.

1336
01:13:35,530 --> 01:13:36,913
We don't have time to reschedule.

1337
01:13:36,959 --> 01:13:38,164
I wanna hear the damn thing now.

1338
01:13:38,199 --> 01:13:39,331
Son, you'll have to wait.

1339
01:13:39,366 --> 01:13:43,393
No, d-don't tell my kid what
to do, uh...

1340
01:13:43,937 --> 01:13:46,907
can't... can't we do this another
time, Mr. Greenway?

1341
01:13:47,122 --> 01:13:51,009
I flew in just to hear this pitch,
and I intend to.

1342
01:13:51,044 --> 01:13:52,511
It's gonna have to wait.

1343
01:13:52,546 --> 01:13:54,546
If you wanna keep your job, Hobbs,

1344
01:13:54,581 --> 01:13:57,550
you will pitch me this book
right now.

1345
01:14:04,817 --> 01:14:07,363
Well... up yours.

1346
01:14:07,466 --> 01:14:10,480
- Yeah, up yours.
- Hey.

1347
01:14:11,544 --> 01:14:13,564
Hobbs... Hobbs!

1348
01:14:13,599 --> 01:14:15,366
Hobbs, you walk out of here,

1349
01:14:15,401 --> 01:14:17,430
and... and you're finished at
Greenway!

1350
01:14:17,518 --> 01:14:19,041
You're finished!

1351
01:14:36,527 --> 01:14:38,407
I don't belong anywhere.

1352
01:14:41,599 --> 01:14:43,584
Buddy!

1353
01:14:43,672 --> 01:14:45,588
Buddy!

1354
01:14:45,684 --> 01:14:47,844
Buddy, where are you?!

1355
01:14:56,172 --> 01:14:59,872
Prancer, pull! Come on! Come on!

1356
01:14:59,918 --> 01:15:03,453
Vixen, up, up!

1357
01:15:03,608 --> 01:15:05,700
Santa?

1358
01:15:05,941 --> 01:15:08,621
Come on, you can do it.

1359
01:15:08,673 --> 01:15:12,266
Pull up! Pull up!

1360
01:15:20,409 --> 01:15:22,476
- Dad!
- What?

1361
01:15:22,491 --> 01:15:23,993
Michael, where you going?

1362
01:15:24,034 --> 01:15:25,364
Michael!

1363
01:15:43,158 --> 01:15:44,050
Santa.

1364
01:15:44,791 --> 01:15:48,783
Back off, slick. You'll scare
the deer.

1365
01:15:48,945 --> 01:15:51,125
Buddy, is that you?

1366
01:15:51,151 --> 01:15:52,492
Are you okay?

1367
01:15:52,527 --> 01:15:55,095
Boy, am I glad to see you.

1368
01:15:55,483 --> 01:15:59,470
The Clausometer suddenly just
dropped down to zero.

1369
01:15:59,536 --> 01:16:03,004
There's just no Christmas
spirit anymore.

1370
01:16:03,072 --> 01:16:05,231
And then the strain was too
much...

1371
01:16:05,278 --> 01:16:08,223
the engine broke free of her
mounts.

1372
01:16:13,873 --> 01:16:16,181
I need an elf's help.

1373
01:16:16,216 --> 01:16:18,718
I... I'm not an elf, Santa.

1374
01:16:18,753 --> 01:16:21,186
I... I can't do anything right.

1375
01:16:21,521 --> 01:16:26,059
Buddy, you're more of an elf than
anyone I ever met,

1376
01:16:26,387 --> 01:16:30,627
and the only one who I would want
working on my sleigh tonight.

1377
01:16:30,705 --> 01:16:32,604
- Really?
- Really.

1378
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:35,160
Will you fix it for me, Buddy?

1379
01:16:35,226 --> 01:16:37,810
I'll try. Papa taught me how.

1380
01:16:37,858 --> 01:16:39,139
You gotta find it first.

1381
01:16:39,219 --> 01:16:41,674
It dropped off the sleigh back
over there a ways.

1382
01:16:42,112 --> 01:16:43,378
- The engine?
- The engine.

1383
01:16:43,445 --> 01:16:44,252
Okay.

1384
01:16:44,292 --> 01:16:47,714
Go, buddy. Go, Mr. Elf!

1385
01:16:49,114 --> 01:16:50,747
<i>I'm standing here outside
Central Park</i>

1386
01:16:50,782 --> 01:16:54,319
<i>where it is unclear exactly
what has happened.</i>

1387
01:16:54,354 --> 01:16:56,221
<i>What we do know is that
authorities</i>

1388
01:16:56,256 --> 01:16:57,056
<i>have closed the park</i>

1389
01:16:57,089 --> 01:16:59,049
<i>and are in the process of
clearing it.</i>

1390
01:16:59,095 --> 01:17:01,093
<i>The only thing that people can
seem to agree on here</i>

1391
01:17:01,128 --> 01:17:04,596
<i>is that they saw something fall
from the sky.</i>

1392
01:17:04,631 --> 01:17:05,831
<i>I've got an eyewitness with me</i>

1393
01:17:05,864 --> 01:17:08,066
<i>who claims to have seen the whole
thing firsthand.</i>

1394
01:17:08,101 --> 01:17:09,994
<i>What did you actually see?</i>

1395
01:17:10,027 --> 01:17:12,078
<i>You know, I was walking around and
I saw this thing,</i>

1396
01:17:12,105 --> 01:17:14,105
<i>and my daughter actually pointed
it out to me.</i>

1397
01:17:14,140 --> 01:17:15,173
<i>Oh, your daughter saw it?</i>

1398
01:17:15,208 --> 01:17:18,432
<i>Sweetheart, can you tell me what
you saw falling out of the sky?</i>

1399
01:17:18,485 --> 01:17:20,277
<i>It was Santa's sleigh!</i>

1400
01:17:21,912 --> 01:17:24,082
<i>Santa's sleigh, well, there you
have it.</i>

1401
01:17:24,142 --> 01:17:25,096
<i>Santa's in Manhattan.</i>

1402
01:17:25,149 --> 01:17:28,075
<i>Sorry to interrupt your first big
news story, Charlotte,</i>

1403
01:17:28,135 --> 01:17:29,988
<i>but New York One has just received</i>

1404
01:17:30,023 --> 01:17:32,529
<i>some exclusive amateur news footage</i>

1405
01:17:32,555 --> 01:17:34,176
<i>that you just might wanna follow
up on.</i>

1406
01:17:34,937 --> 01:17:37,728
<i>There seems to be a strange man
dressed as an elf</i>

1407
01:17:37,755 --> 01:17:39,187
<i>wandering through Central Park.</i>

1408
01:17:39,895 --> 01:17:42,388
<i>Now, I don't know if this is the
kind of hard-hitting news</i>

1409
01:17:42,428 --> 01:17:44,462
<i>you're used to covering in Buffalo,
Charlotte,</i>

1410
01:17:44,502 --> 01:17:48,260
- Oh, my God.
<i>- but here at New York One, news is top priority.</i>

1411
01:17:58,782 --> 01:18:01,283
What the heck...?

1412
01:18:01,318 --> 01:18:03,183
Hey!

1413
01:18:03,619 --> 01:18:06,315
- You found it.
- Buddy!

1414
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:13,211
I need to tell you something.

1415
01:18:13,246 --> 01:18:14,321
No, no. Buddy, there's something

1416
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:15,516
I have to tell you right now.

1417
01:18:15,677 --> 01:18:19,697
Um, I didn't mean anything I said back
there, not... not a word.

1418
01:18:19,737 --> 01:18:23,437
I know you may be a little, um, um...

1419
01:18:23,507 --> 01:18:24,700
uh, chemically imbalanced,

1420
01:18:24,740 --> 01:18:27,475
but you've been right about a lot
of things.

1421
01:18:27,953 --> 01:18:30,693
I... I don't want you to leave.

1422
01:18:30,730 --> 01:18:34,094
You're my son, and I... love you.

1423
01:18:41,309 --> 01:18:42,776
Uh, Buddy, uh...

1424
01:18:43,316 --> 01:18:45,299
what was it you wanted to tell me?

1425
01:18:45,361 --> 01:18:47,429
Oh, right. Come with me.

1426
01:18:47,462 --> 01:18:49,492
- Right.
- Come on.

1427
01:18:56,075 --> 01:18:57,169
<i>I'm here with another eyewitness</i>

1428
01:18:57,204 --> 01:18:59,174

happened.</i>

1429
01:18:59,221 --> 01:19:00,639
<i>Sir, what did you see?</i>

1430
01:19:00,921 --> 01:19:01,873
<i>I think you're great, Charlotte.</i>

1431
01:19:01,908 --> 01:19:04,328
<i>Uh, I saw something fall from the
sky</i>

1432
01:19:04,348 --> 01:19:05,694
<i>right into the middle of Central
Park.</i>

1433
01:19:05,728 --> 01:19:07,654
<i>I mean, you're a great news lady.</i>

1434
01:19:07,721 --> 01:19:08,488
<i>Thank you.</i>

1435
01:19:08,528 --> 01:19:11,141
<i>Could you tell me a bit more about
what you saw fall from the sky?</i>

1436
01:19:11,168 --> 01:19:12,801
<i>Yeah, yeah. Your
eyes tell the story,</i>

1437
01:19:12,848 --> 01:19:14,921
<i>that's what I love about you.
You've got a great mouth.</i>

1438
01:19:14,947 --> 01:19:17,140
<i>The thing just dropped in the middle of
Central Park.</i>

1439
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:19,653
<i>It was amazing, and everybody's, like,
going crazy.</i>

1440
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:22,981
<i>Dick, uh, according to authorities,
the area has been cleared.</i>

1441
01:19:23,028 --> 01:19:25,998
<i>Only the Central Park rangers now
remain in the park.</i>

1442
01:19:26,614 --> 01:19:30,161
<i>These forces are highly trained,
but rarely see action.</i>

1443
01:19:30,221 --> 01:19:33,646
<i>Some have accused them of being too
gung-ho when called into duty,</i>

1444
01:19:33,647 --> 01:19:36,041

1447
01:19:40,940 --> 01:19:43,379
I knew you'd find it, Mr. Elf!

1448
01:19:43,414 --> 01:19:46,747
Slap it on real quick, we've got
to get going.

1449
01:19:48,866 --> 01:19:50,034
Thatta boy.

1450
01:19:53,424 --> 01:19:55,951
So, uh... you're, uh...

1451
01:19:55,984 --> 01:19:58,682
- Santa Claus.
- Right.

1452
01:20:00,596 --> 01:20:03,657
Would you mind taking this to
your firstborn?

1453
01:20:03,684 --> 01:20:04,499
Sure.

1454
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:07,738
Um, uh, and my firstborn, he's
an elf?

1455
01:20:07,773 --> 01:20:11,401
- Yes.
- Actually, I'm adopted.

1456
01:20:11,742 --> 01:20:15,769
Uh, Michael, would you open this
hatch for me, please?

1457
01:20:21,451 --> 01:20:23,518
Thatta boy, thank you.

1458
01:20:24,039 --> 01:20:27,426
So, you're really Santa Claus?

1459
01:20:27,466 --> 01:20:29,992
You never can tell, kid.

1460
01:20:30,027 --> 01:20:32,561
Tell me, Michael,
what do you want for Christmas?

1461
01:20:32,596 --> 01:20:35,715
I wanted a skateboard.

1462
01:20:35,750 --> 01:20:39,277
Oh, not just a skateboard.

1463
01:20:39,312 --> 01:20:42,805
A real Huff board. Lookie here...

1464
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:44,238
lookie here!

1465
01:20:44,273 --> 01:20:46,342
How do you like them apples?

1466
01:20:46,377 --> 01:20:49,072
Go look and see.

1467
01:20:55,236 --> 01:20:56,703
Whoa.

1468
01:21:03,264 --> 01:21:04,263
What happened?

1469
01:21:04,592 --> 01:21:07,329
You made my sleigh fly.

1470
01:21:07,364 --> 01:21:08,061
What do you mean?

1471
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:10,263
Well, before the turbine days,

1472
01:21:10,298 --> 01:21:13,301
this baby used to run solely on
Christmas spirit.

1473
01:21:13,696 --> 01:21:18,102
You believed in me. You made my
sleigh fly.

1474
01:21:18,176 --> 01:21:20,516
Hold it... if you're really Santa
Claus,

1475
01:21:20,562 --> 01:21:22,543
then we can just get some news
cameras in here,

1476
01:21:22,578 --> 01:21:25,178
and everyone will believe in you,
then your sleigh will fly, right?

1477
01:21:25,211 --> 01:21:28,698
Christmas spirit is about believing,
not seeing.

1478
01:21:28,731 --> 01:21:31,351
If the whole world saw me,
all would be lost.

1479
01:21:31,391 --> 01:21:35,562
The paparazzi have been trying to
nail me for years.

1480
01:21:37,558 --> 01:21:39,025
Hey, look!

1481
01:21:44,584 --> 01:21:48,084
Oh no.

1482
01:21:48,334 --> 01:21:52,105
It's the Central Park rangers.

1483
01:21:56,208 --> 01:21:58,249
Dad, Michael...

1484
01:21:59,695 --> 01:22:01,535
I got a plan.

1485
01:22:09,388 --> 01:22:12,089
Whoa, wait! Wait, Michael...
my list!

1486
01:22:12,124 --> 01:22:14,893
You bring that list back right now,
you hear me?!

1487
01:22:14,928 --> 01:22:16,962
Come on, give me your hat and coat.

1488
01:22:16,997 --> 01:22:19,897
Mrs. Claus made them for me.

1489
01:22:24,169 --> 01:22:27,161
Hey! Hey, here I am!

1490
01:22:28,695 --> 01:22:29,972
Ho ho ho!

1491
01:22:30,568 --> 01:22:34,677
Hey, ho ho ho! Hey! Hey!

1492
01:22:42,279 --> 01:22:44,439
Excuse me. Thank you. Excuse me.

1493
01:22:44,473 --> 01:22:47,890
So the authorities have not
discovered any reindeer in the park?

1494
01:22:48,005 --> 01:22:50,085
- No, no reindeer.
- Sleigh bells?

1495
01:22:50,111 --> 01:22:51,336
No, no sleigh bells, either.

1496
01:22:51,371 --> 01:22:52,318
- Elves?
- Excuse me, please.

1497
01:22:52,351 --> 01:22:53,445
None of that, we really just
need everyone...

1498
01:22:53,498 --> 01:22:54,529
It's him, it's the real Santa!

1499
01:22:54,563 --> 01:22:56,826
<i>His sleigh won't fly, 'cause nobody
believes in him!</i>

1500
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:57,892
<i>Did you see something
in the park?</i>

1501
01:22:57,893 --> 01:22:58,933
<i>Everyone out there,</i>

1502
01:22:58,973 --> 01:23:00,826
<i>Santa needs us to believe.
I can prove he's real,</i>

1503
01:23:00,852 --> 01:23:02,626
<i>look, this is his list!</i>

1504
01:23:02,672 --> 01:23:04,906
<i>Okay... well, further confirmation</i>

1505
01:23:04,941 --> 01:23:07,510
that there has been a Santa
sighting tonight.

1506
01:23:07,545 --> 01:23:08,711
We have the Naughty and Nice list.

1507
01:23:08,772 --> 01:23:11,074

Girls play set.

1508
01:23:11,615 --> 01:23:13,211

Dave Keckler wants
some Nike Shocks.

1516
01:23:29,683 --> 01:23:34,256
Okay, uh, well, obviously we have
a new development in the story, uh,

1517
01:23:34,296 --> 01:23:39,056
a confirmation that Santa must have been
sighted because we have his book right here.

1518
01:23:39,089 --> 01:23:40,174
What's your name?

1519
01:23:40,209 --> 01:23:43,272
Uh, I'm Charlotte Denon, New York One.

Who told you to say that?

1528
01:24:03,519 --> 01:24:04,630
It's the real Santa.

1529
01:24:04,665 --> 01:24:06,399
We need to get these cameras
back on.

1530
01:24:06,432 --> 01:24:07,933
He needs our help!

1531
01:24:07,968 --> 01:24:09,951

01:24:09,998 --> 01:24:11,131
Yeah, I'm fine.

1533
01:24:11,191 --> 01:24:13,871
But Buddy, he's... he's in the
park with Santa!

1534
01:24:13,898 --> 01:24:17,284
The sleigh won't fly because
there's no Christmas spirit.

1535
01:24:17,306 --> 01:24:19,439
- Michael!
- Mom!

1536
01:24:19,516 --> 01:24:22,281
Michael! Ohh!

1537
01:24:23,216 --> 01:24:25,484

Get in now!

1541
01:24:40,042 --> 01:24:42,329

engine yet!

Can't wait!

You get started, I'll catch up!

1547
01:25:02,373 --> 01:25:04,772
You know, he wasn't lying.

1548

Merry Christmas.

1549
