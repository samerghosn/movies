00:01:06,444 --> 00:01:07,536
Come on, sweetie pie.

3
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:13,174
Morning, Elvis.
You're a pretty Elvis, aren't you?

4
00:01:13,251 --> 00:01:15,548
Yes, you are.

5
00:01:15,619 --> 00:01:18,213
Yes, you are.

6
00:01:18,788 --> 00:01:22,246
Jesus Christ, Ronnie, you know
I have to fucking work tonight.

7
00:01:22,459 --> 00:01:23,983
Somebody around here
has got to make some money.

8
00:01:24,294 --> 00:01:27,187
I'm all broken up here, bitch.
I can't work.

9
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:29,130
- Yeah, and whose fault is that?
- Fuck you.

10
00:01:29,199 --> 00:01:31,463
Oh, my God, you're pathetic.

11
00:01:31,535 --> 00:01:33,729
You know that new waitress
over at the Bingo Lounge?

12
00:01:33,803 --> 00:01:36,033
She's been giving
me the freaky eye.

13
00:01:36,105 --> 00:01:38,505
Oh, the whore with the big tits
hanging down to her knees?

14
00:01:38,574 --> 00:01:39,768
Maybe I'll choke the chicken,

15
00:01:39,842 --> 00:01:42,332
purge my snorkel
all over them flappy-ass tits.

16
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:43,672
Good. Well, have
a good fucking time.

17
00:01:43,745 --> 00:01:45,007
- I will.
- I hope she likes cripples.

18
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:49,210
Bitch, I will crawl over there,
and I will skull fuck the shit outta you!

19
00:01:49,284 --> 00:01:51,378
Oh, I'll get the crutches for you.

20
00:01:53,956 --> 00:01:55,923
See what you did?
Fucking loudmouth.

21
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:56,979
Waah! Waah!

22
00:01:57,058 --> 00:01:58,753
That's all that fucker does is cry.

23
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,726
Waah! Waah!

24
00:02:01,563 --> 00:02:03,257
Cry and shit. Cry and shit.

25
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,231
Just like you.
That's all you do is cry and shit.

26
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,529
Fuck you and set it
on my pole right now, bitch.

27
00:02:07,601 --> 00:02:09,228
Fuck off.

28
00:02:14,976 --> 00:02:17,069
Mom?

29
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,206
Can't you see I'm
making eggs over here?

30
00:02:22,283 --> 00:02:23,750
I'll pass.

31
00:02:23,818 --> 00:02:24,876
Since when?

32
00:02:24,953 --> 00:02:28,285
Since now. They're chicken abortions,
and they're fucking gross.

33
00:02:28,355 --> 00:02:30,186
They are not chicken abortions.

34
00:02:30,257 --> 00:02:31,952
Like you know what an abortion is.

35
00:02:33,894 --> 00:02:35,589
You know what, can you please
go upstairs and get your brother?

36
00:02:35,928 --> 00:02:37,590
Why do I always have to do it?

37
00:02:37,664 --> 00:02:38,857
Just do it!

38
00:02:40,868 --> 00:02:44,359
Don't you give me that look!

39
00:02:44,437 --> 00:02:47,372
Man, that bitch got herself
a nice little dumper.

40
00:02:48,574 --> 00:02:51,270
- What did you just say?
- You heard me.

41
00:02:51,344 --> 00:02:54,507
No, say it again, Ronnie!
Say it to my face!

42
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:58,106
Oh, what's the matter?
You jealous of your own daughter's ass?

43
00:02:58,183 --> 00:03:00,345
- Fucking pig.
- Aah!

44
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,011
You fucking whore!

45
00:03:03,221 --> 00:03:05,746
All right, now clean it up!

46
00:03:05,824 --> 00:03:07,348
- Go on.
- I'm not gonna do this anymore!

47
00:03:08,994 --> 00:03:10,689
Michael.

48
00:03:10,762 --> 00:03:12,992
Stop jerking off in there.

49
00:03:13,064 --> 00:03:14,361
Get away!

50
00:03:14,433 --> 00:03:16,525
Hey! Get your ass downstairs

51
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,466
and wash your hands, you little shit.

52
00:03:18,537 --> 00:03:22,063
I'm not listening!
Aaaahhh!

53
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:23,367
Let me tell you something.

54
00:03:23,441 --> 00:03:25,602
That freak of yours,
he needs some serious discipline.

55
00:03:25,676 --> 00:03:27,667
I mean, he runs around
like a little bitch.

56
00:03:27,745 --> 00:03:29,644
You leave him alone.
Keep your hands off him.

57
00:03:29,712 --> 00:03:32,944
Give me a fucking break.
He's probably a queer.

58
00:03:33,017 --> 00:03:35,314
He's gonna grow up,
end up cutting his dick and balls off

59
00:03:35,385 --> 00:03:37,216
and changing his name to Michelle.

60
00:03:38,455 --> 00:03:41,151
<i>There he is.
Good morning, Michelle, ma belle.</i>

61
00:03:41,224 --> 00:03:43,192
What the hell took you two so long?

62
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:46,160
Elvis died. I had to flush him.

63
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:48,697
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

64
00:03:48,765 --> 00:03:50,925
We'll get you a new one
after school, okay?

65
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,261
Okay.

66
00:03:52,334 --> 00:03:55,270
What'd you do to him,
stroke him to death?

67
00:03:55,338 --> 00:03:56,827
Uh, Elvis.

68
00:03:56,905 --> 00:03:59,601
Elvis! Uh! Uh! Uh!

69
00:03:59,675 --> 00:04:01,540
You know what?
It's a fucking rat.

70
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:03,406
Who pays money for a fucking rat?

71
00:04:03,478 --> 00:04:05,276
I mean, it's a goddamn rat, man.

72
00:04:05,347 --> 00:04:06,678
Morning, Boo.

73
00:04:06,748 --> 00:04:09,215
"Morning, Boo."

74
00:04:12,954 --> 00:04:14,251
Take that damn thing off.

75
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,127
You are starting to annoy me, boy.

76
00:04:20,194 --> 00:04:21,219
I hate you.

77
00:04:21,296 --> 00:04:23,286
And I hate you, too. You see this?

78
00:04:23,364 --> 00:04:26,231
As soon as this heals,
I'm gonna break it again on your fucking face!

79
00:04:26,301 --> 00:04:28,768
Enough, all right?
Can we just eat in peace for once?

80
00:04:39,213 --> 00:04:42,511
What a fucking pussy, dude.
I told you he wouldn't fight.

81
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:44,573
He's all fucking talk.
I was like-- We were fighting, right?

82
00:04:44,652 --> 00:04:47,313
You were there. He was like,
"I'm not gonna fight you." I was like--

83
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:48,581
Yes!

84
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,421
I know where he lives.

85
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:53,721
- You want to egg his house?
- We can totally do that.

86
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:54,919
- Yeah.
- Oh.

87
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:56,894
Hey, shit-pants.

88
00:04:56,962 --> 00:04:59,453
What's going on? You know, um...

89
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:03,094
I heard your sister got caught
selling blow jobs in the bathroom.

90
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:08,162
I heard they had to pump the cum
out of her stomach.

91
00:05:10,042 --> 00:05:11,805
Hey, Mikey, how's your mom doing?

92
00:05:11,877 --> 00:05:15,039
You know, my old man said that for a buck
she'd rub her tits on his face.

93
00:05:15,113 --> 00:05:16,705
Shut up.

94
00:05:16,781 --> 00:05:18,112
What the fuck did you say, faggot?

95
00:05:18,182 --> 00:05:20,946
- Mikey's upset.
- Look how tough he is.

96
00:05:21,019 --> 00:05:24,785
Hey, ball-licker, check this out.

97
00:05:24,856 --> 00:05:28,849
I was thinking of making copies of Mommy
for the whole school.

98
00:05:28,927 --> 00:05:31,555
- Fuck you.
- Hey! Tough guy!

99
00:05:31,629 --> 00:05:36,088
Think she'd suck my dick for a quarter
and let me suck her tits?

100
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:39,932
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Don't fucking yell in my face, you bitch!

101
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:44,334
Fuck off!

102
00:05:44,408 --> 00:05:46,432
What the hell is going on here?

103
00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:47,499
Break it up!

104
00:05:47,577 --> 00:05:48,976
I said break it up!

105
00:05:49,045 --> 00:05:51,570
You over there,
you over there, you there.

106
00:05:51,647 --> 00:05:53,980
- He started it.
- Shut up!

107
00:05:54,051 --> 00:05:55,108
Fuck you.

108
00:05:57,687 --> 00:05:58,745
What did you say, son?

109
00:05:58,821 --> 00:06:01,483
I said fuck you.

110
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,686
Fuck me?

111
00:06:04,593 --> 00:06:07,085
Come here.
Come here.

112
00:06:07,162 --> 00:06:08,527
- My bag!
- Grab it!

113
00:06:09,532 --> 00:06:13,763
Again? Again? Jesus, what is it with you
and this goddamn school?

114
00:06:13,835 --> 00:06:15,530
I cannot keep coming down here like this.

115
00:06:15,604 --> 00:06:17,628
Look, Miss Myers,

116
00:06:17,705 --> 00:06:21,971
I do not enjoy calling you down here
every five minutes.

117
00:06:22,043 --> 00:06:24,340
Really?
It sure seems like you fucking do.

118
00:06:24,411 --> 00:06:26,506
Can't you get control
over your school, principal?

119
00:06:26,582 --> 00:06:29,846
Yes, I can get control.
I can control my school.

120
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:32,716
There's something you gotta know.

121
00:06:37,926 --> 00:06:41,452
Will you just relax a moment?
Please sit down and let me talk to you.

122
00:06:41,528 --> 00:06:43,723
- Please. Please.
- Okay. What?

123
00:06:43,797 --> 00:06:45,856
Please, sit down.

124
00:06:45,933 --> 00:06:48,766
- Thank God.
- Hi, Jim. How are you?

125
00:06:48,836 --> 00:06:49,860
Is this her?

126
00:06:51,504 --> 00:06:54,702
Miss Myers, this is Dr. Loomis.
I took the liberty of calling him in.

127
00:06:55,075 --> 00:06:57,235
- Happens to be a child psychologist--
- Thank you, Jim.

128
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,607
Psychologist?

129
00:06:58,678 --> 00:07:00,009
May I ask you,

130
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:03,412
has your son ever had any kind
of serious psychiatric evaluation?

131
00:07:03,483 --> 00:07:05,951
Okay, I've had enough.
This is crazy.

132
00:07:06,019 --> 00:07:07,680
- Miss Myers, please.
- I gotta get back to work.

133
00:07:07,754 --> 00:07:09,221
- I gotta go.
- Please, ma'am.

134
00:07:09,288 --> 00:07:12,052
We only want the best for the child.
Please don't take offense.

135
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,716
Please, sit down. Sit down.

136
00:07:13,792 --> 00:07:14,817
Thank you.

137
00:07:14,894 --> 00:07:17,555
Look, uh, Miss Myers...

138
00:07:17,629 --> 00:07:19,290
we found this...

139
00:07:19,364 --> 00:07:21,161
in Michael's school bag.

140
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:25,569
Come on. Big deal.
He found a dead cat.

141
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:28,970
And these.

142
00:07:30,008 --> 00:07:31,532
What is that?

143
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,770
I hope you're not squeamish, Mrs. Myers.

144
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:37,143
Oh, God.

145
00:07:37,214 --> 00:07:39,182
Oh, this is really sick.

146
00:07:41,051 --> 00:07:43,111
Are you saying Michael did this?

147
00:07:44,655 --> 00:07:46,213
Michael loves animals. He--

148
00:07:48,992 --> 00:07:50,425
Why would he do this?

149
00:07:50,493 --> 00:07:55,988
Mrs. Myers, typically the thrill of hurting
or causing pain to smaller creatures,

150
00:07:56,066 --> 00:07:58,500
it's often an early warning sign.

151
00:07:58,568 --> 00:08:00,126
Early warning sign for what?

152
00:08:02,772 --> 00:08:04,966
For much deeper and bigger problems.

153
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,372
What do you mean problems?
What is this?

154
00:08:07,443 --> 00:08:10,105
He's a very disturbed young man.

155
00:08:10,179 --> 00:08:14,013
I have to evaluate him,
and I'd like to interview him.

156
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:16,984
I need to take him
through a series of tests.

157
00:08:17,052 --> 00:08:18,679
Well, you can talk to him,
but what does--

158
00:08:18,754 --> 00:08:20,482
what does evaluating him--
what does that mean?

159
00:08:20,555 --> 00:08:24,651
Obviously, he's a very deranged
young mind that can do this to his pets.

160
00:08:24,726 --> 00:08:26,694
You don't know that he did that.

161
00:08:29,063 --> 00:08:32,396
Fuck, man, if I get one more fucking detention,
I'll be fucking expelled.

162
00:08:32,467 --> 00:08:33,867
My old man's gonna beat my ass.

163
00:08:33,936 --> 00:08:36,928
We gotta get that piece of shit
on the weekend so we don't get in trouble.

164
00:08:37,005 --> 00:08:39,030
Dude, if I see that Myers pussy,
he's fucking dead.

165
00:08:54,989 --> 00:08:55,978
You want it?

166
00:08:56,057 --> 00:08:57,581
Huh? Do you want it?

167
00:09:37,328 --> 00:09:38,693
Aah!

168
00:09:38,763 --> 00:09:40,287
Ow!

169
00:09:43,334 --> 00:09:44,733
What the fuck?

170
00:09:44,803 --> 00:09:47,566
Oh, you're so fucking dead.

171
00:09:52,876 --> 00:09:55,037
Oh, please stop.

172
00:09:55,112 --> 00:09:56,170
Stop!

173
00:10:12,929 --> 00:10:13,953
Please.

174
00:10:24,372 --> 00:10:27,136
Please.
Please no!

175
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,767
I'm sorry.

176
00:10:31,246 --> 00:10:34,215
Don't hurt me. Just-- I'm sorry.

177
00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:40,145
No, no, no, don't.
Don't. Please. Please.

178
00:10:49,397 --> 00:10:51,489
Please.

179
00:10:51,565 --> 00:10:53,295
Don't hurt me.

180
00:11:03,844 --> 00:11:04,970
No.

181
00:12:00,131 --> 00:12:01,428
Hey, clown.

182
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,897
Hey.

183
00:12:05,869 --> 00:12:08,134
Psycho boy.

184
00:12:08,205 --> 00:12:09,796
Cat killer.

185
00:12:10,975 --> 00:12:14,740
Do you really torture and kill
all them worthless animals, boy?

186
00:12:17,547 --> 00:12:21,278
Make you feel like a real bad-ass
motherfucker killer, huh?

187
00:12:22,352 --> 00:12:24,285
That is some deep-ass,

188
00:12:24,353 --> 00:12:27,812
serious, faggoty-ass shit, man.

189
00:12:27,891 --> 00:12:29,858
Judith, I'm gonna be late!

190
00:12:29,925 --> 00:12:33,588
"Judith, I'm gonna be late!"

191
00:12:33,696 --> 00:12:36,358
You really are a whiny little bitch,
you know that?

192
00:12:36,432 --> 00:12:38,059
Ronnie, knock it off.

193
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,669
Ma, Judith is wasting all my time.

194
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:47,640
I really shouldn't even let you go
after that shit you pulled today at school.

195
00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:49,336
Oh, Ma, please?

196
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:51,379
All right, Michael, calm down.

197
00:12:51,447 --> 00:12:52,845
Tomorrow things are gonna change
around here,

198
00:12:52,914 --> 00:12:54,542
so I suggest you live it up tonight.

199
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:57,876
Judith!

200
00:12:59,121 --> 00:13:00,178
Here.

201
00:13:03,691 --> 00:13:04,715
What?

202
00:13:04,792 --> 00:13:06,919
Would you do me a favor and please
take your brother trick-or-treating?

203
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:10,260
Why don't you have that subhuman sloth
over there on the couch do it?

204
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:13,323
You know, if I could get that lazy drunk
off his fat ass, I would.

205
00:13:13,401 --> 00:13:18,030
Bitch, if you don't think I ain't making
a mental list of all your fucking bullshit!

206
00:13:20,173 --> 00:13:21,640
Sweetie, look at me.

207
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,471
I know things have been bad,

208
00:13:23,543 --> 00:13:26,171
but tomorrow we start to make
everything better, okay?

209
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,747
- Yeah.

210
00:13:29,815 --> 00:13:33,115
I like your hair curly.
It looks pretty.

211
00:13:33,186 --> 00:13:36,518
Thanks, sweetie.
Have fun trick-or-treating, okay?

212
00:13:36,589 --> 00:13:38,022
Don't eat too much candy.

213
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:39,250
Hey, Mrs. Myers.

214
00:13:39,325 --> 00:13:40,883
I want you out by 11.

215
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,155
- What'd I do?
- I know what you do.

216
00:13:43,229 --> 00:13:44,560
Whatever.

217
00:13:46,264 --> 00:13:48,324
What about trick-or-treating?

218
00:13:48,401 --> 00:13:50,334
Are you kidding me?
Go by yourself.

219
00:13:50,402 --> 00:13:52,667
Aren't you too old for that, anyway?

220
00:13:52,738 --> 00:13:53,726
Whatever.

221
00:13:53,805 --> 00:13:55,670
Sorry, squirt, but have fun.

222
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,731
Trick or treat!

223
00:13:57,809 --> 00:13:59,800

Hold up, man.

That fucking drunk-prick fuck Ronnie
ain't my dad.

241
00:15:20,988 --> 00:15:23,047
Okay, l-- I didn't know.

242
00:15:23,124 --> 00:15:25,285

Okay.

I'm sorry.

245
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:31,297
Close your eyes.

246
00:15:35,636 --> 00:15:37,660
Keep them closed, all right?

247
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:40,872
I got a surprise for you.

248
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,035
Open.

249
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:48,136
Aaarrrgghhh!

250
00:15:48,214 --> 00:15:51,115
Aaahh!

251
00:15:51,184 --> 00:15:52,742
- Wow.
- What?

252
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:54,115
Take that stupid thing off.

253
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:56,950
Oh, come on, babe.
I want to do it with the mask on.

254
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,176
Uhh!

255
00:20:39,123 --> 00:20:42,558
Uhh! Uhh! Uhh! Uhh!

256
00:22:12,812 --> 00:22:14,939
Steve, stop it.

257
00:22:16,983 --> 00:22:18,041
Stop.

258
00:22:18,117 --> 00:22:19,276
Once a night is enough.

259
00:22:19,352 --> 00:22:21,286
Stop it.

260
00:22:22,821 --> 00:22:24,288
Michael?

261
00:22:25,224 --> 00:22:27,852
Michael, what the fuck
are you doing in here?

262
00:22:27,927 --> 00:22:29,951
Answer me.
Michael.

263
00:22:30,028 --> 00:22:31,757
Michael!

264
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:32,819
Answer me!

265
00:22:32,898 --> 00:22:35,833
What the fuck--
Michael!

266
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,197
Answer--

267
00:24:26,205 --> 00:24:27,833
Happy Halloween, Boo.

268
00:24:50,728 --> 00:24:52,423
Jesus, what the hell happened now?

269
00:24:55,732 --> 00:24:58,064
Sweetie, what are you doing out here?

270
00:24:59,469 --> 00:25:00,834
It's freezing.

271
00:25:00,904 --> 00:25:02,531
Michael, what's going on?

272
00:25:04,041 --> 00:25:06,100
Michael, answer me.

273
00:25:08,311 --> 00:25:09,777
Give me the baby.

274
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,977
Michael, what is going on?

275
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:14,415
Answer me.

276
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:31,630
...in connection
with tonight's brutal murders.

277
00:25:36,171 --> 00:25:37,696
...the Myers family,

278
00:25:37,773 --> 00:25:40,833
and was described by police
as Manson-like in its viciousness,

279
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:44,710
and more horrific than anything
Hollywood could imagine.

280
00:25:46,715 --> 00:25:49,913
Judith Myers' nude body
was found lying face-down

281
00:25:49,985 --> 00:25:52,418
in a pool of blood in an upstairs hallway.

282
00:25:52,487 --> 00:25:55,513
Apparently she had been stabbed 17 times.

283
00:25:55,590 --> 00:26:00,459
Her boyfriend Steven Haley's body
was found in the kitchen downstairs,

284
00:26:00,528 --> 00:26:05,021
the victim of an apparent vicious beating
with an aluminum baseball bat.

285
00:26:05,099 --> 00:26:06,293
Along with Myers and Haley,

286
00:26:06,366 --> 00:26:08,335
a third victim, Ronnie White,

287
00:26:08,403 --> 00:26:10,199
who was found bound to a chair,

288
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:13,296
White's neck slit wide open
with a kitchen knife

289
00:26:13,373 --> 00:26:16,536
and stabbed numerous times
in the face and chest.

290
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:20,011
Of course we'll have much more
on this horrific story as it develops.

291
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,843
But for now,
three people brutally murdered,

292
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:27,113
and a 10-year-old boy, Michael Myers,
being held in custody.

293
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,907
<i>I'm standing outside
Smith's Grove Sanitarium</i>

294
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:53,308
<i>where late last night,</i>

295
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:56,108
<i>10-year-old Michael Myers was transferred</i>

296
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:58,375
<i>after being found guilty
of first-degree murder.</i>

297
00:26:58,449 --> 00:27:01,043
<i>Myers' verdict comes
after one of the lengthiest</i>

298
00:27:01,118 --> 00:27:03,712
<i>and most expensive trials
in the state's history.</i>

299
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:07,188
<i>In attendance during this trial,
Dr. Samuel Loomis.</i>

300
00:27:07,257 --> 00:27:09,658
<i>Loomis has now been appointed
by Judge Masterson</i>

301
00:27:09,727 --> 00:27:13,561
<i>to oversee Myers' care
while incarcerated here at Smith's Grove.</i>

302
00:27:15,331 --> 00:27:16,389
Hello, hello, hello.

303
00:27:16,466 --> 00:27:18,093
Can you talk in there?

304
00:27:18,168 --> 00:27:19,533
Hi, I'm Michael Myers.

305
00:27:19,602 --> 00:27:20,899
Okay, okay. That's fine.

306
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:23,905
That's good. That's good.
Okay, we're on.

307
00:27:23,973 --> 00:27:25,770
How are you feeling today?

308
00:27:25,842 --> 00:27:26,830
Good.

309
00:27:28,845 --> 00:27:31,210
Could I ask you something?

310
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,475
You can ask me
whatever you want.

311
00:27:33,549 --> 00:27:35,016
That's why I'm here.

312
00:27:35,083 --> 00:27:38,519
If you have anything on your mind,
feel free-- anything.

313
00:27:38,587 --> 00:27:40,054
Okay.

314
00:27:40,122 --> 00:27:42,249
Why do you talk so funny?

315
00:27:43,292 --> 00:27:44,351
Talk so funny?

316
00:27:44,427 --> 00:27:48,363
Tell me, Michael,

317
00:27:48,431 --> 00:27:50,921
what do you remember about...

318
00:27:50,999 --> 00:27:53,194
that night, Halloween?

319
00:27:55,737 --> 00:27:58,604
What do you mean,
like my costume and candy?

320
00:28:00,042 --> 00:28:02,943
So you remember nothing
about the killing?

321
00:28:05,112 --> 00:28:07,910
You remember nothing
about getting a knife?

322
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:11,511
- I didn't do that.
- Oh, okay.

323
00:28:11,586 --> 00:28:13,884
But you were covered in blood.
Whose blood was it?

324
00:28:13,955 --> 00:28:15,114
I don't know.

325
00:28:15,256 --> 00:28:17,689
Case: Michael Myers.

326
00:28:17,757 --> 00:28:22,718
To the untrained eye,
there's nothing visually abnormal

327
00:28:22,797 --> 00:28:27,165
with this angelic young boy,
but one must remember not to be fooled

328
00:28:27,234 --> 00:28:30,465
by his calm, unassuming facade.

329
00:28:30,537 --> 00:28:32,232
Can I go home today?

330
00:28:32,305 --> 00:28:34,398
No, not today.

331
00:28:34,474 --> 00:28:36,305
Tomorrow?

332
00:28:36,376 --> 00:28:39,174
I don't know.
I have to talk to the doctor about that.

333
00:28:42,681 --> 00:28:44,912
- Hey, Mommy.
- Yeah.

334
00:28:44,985 --> 00:28:47,350
Is everyone at home okay?

335
00:28:52,157 --> 00:28:53,852
Everything's okay at home.

336
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,354
Okay.

337
00:29:25,956 --> 00:29:26,944
Hey, Mikey.

338
00:29:27,023 --> 00:29:28,616
How you doing?

339
00:29:30,193 --> 00:29:33,958
Look, you can't let those walls
get you down.

340
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:35,998
Believe me, I know.

341
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:37,965
I spent a little time behind walls.

342
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:42,166
I know they can drive you crazy.

343
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:44,138
You gotta look beyond the walls.

344
00:29:44,206 --> 00:29:47,936
You know,
learn to live inside your head.

345
00:29:48,009 --> 00:29:50,876
Hey, there's no walls
that can stop you there.

346
00:29:52,549 --> 00:29:54,982
All right, I gotta get back to work.

347
00:29:55,051 --> 00:29:56,848
Now you take it easy, Mikey.

348
00:30:06,194 --> 00:30:07,786
Look at my mask.

349
00:30:08,897 --> 00:30:11,388
Oh, wow. Beautiful. Yeah.

350
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,700
Why is it all black?

351
00:30:15,203 --> 00:30:16,932
'Cause it's one of my favorite colors.

352
00:30:17,005 --> 00:30:19,565
Well, actually black isn't a color, is it?

353
00:30:19,641 --> 00:30:21,540
It's the absence of color.

354
00:30:21,608 --> 00:30:24,100
In the spectrum of colors,

355
00:30:24,178 --> 00:30:26,579
you go from black,
which is no color,

356
00:30:26,648 --> 00:30:29,480
all the way through to white,

357
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:31,415
which is every color.

358
00:30:32,853 --> 00:30:34,649
So technically--

359
00:30:34,721 --> 00:30:38,385
not that it really matters--
but black isn't a color.

360
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,283
Why did you make it?

361
00:30:41,361 --> 00:30:42,623
I have my secrets.

362
00:30:42,695 --> 00:30:45,095
Wait a minute.

363
00:30:45,164 --> 00:30:48,395
I thought we had no secrets,
you and I.

364
00:30:48,468 --> 00:30:49,730
Because no one sees me.

365
00:30:49,802 --> 00:30:51,792
Yes, they do.
I see you every day.

366
00:30:51,871 --> 00:30:55,272
Your mom, she comes every week.

367
00:30:55,341 --> 00:30:58,037
Anybody else?

368
00:30:59,444 --> 00:31:00,434
No.

369
00:31:00,513 --> 00:31:02,639
<i>Michael has begun to obsess</i>

370
00:31:02,714 --> 00:31:06,013
<i>on the construction
of these primitive masks.</i>

371
00:31:06,084 --> 00:31:08,551
<i>It is the rare occasion
that he will allow himself</i>

372
00:31:08,619 --> 00:31:10,451
<i>to be seen without one of these.</i>

373
00:31:10,522 --> 00:31:12,716
<i>Only during the weekly visits
from his mother</i>

374
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:16,817
<i>does he show brief glimpses of the boy
he once may have been.</i>

375
00:31:25,435 --> 00:31:27,267
Do you like my mask?

376
00:31:29,606 --> 00:31:31,233
When did you make this?

377
00:31:31,307 --> 00:31:32,798
Just yesterday.

378
00:31:34,412 --> 00:31:37,574
I like the mask because it hides my face.

379
00:31:39,182 --> 00:31:41,412
I don't like you to hide your face.

380
00:31:41,484 --> 00:31:42,951
Take it off.

381
00:31:43,019 --> 00:31:44,816
It hides my ugliness.

382
00:31:45,955 --> 00:31:48,047
Sweetie, don't say that.
Take it off.

383
00:31:48,123 --> 00:31:49,613
You're not ugly.

384
00:31:51,161 --> 00:31:52,855
Don't talk like that, okay?

385
00:31:52,928 --> 00:31:54,190
Okay.

386
00:31:57,066 --> 00:31:58,897
I miss you so much.

387
00:31:58,967 --> 00:32:00,492
I miss you, too.

388
00:32:18,887 --> 00:32:21,684
<i>Michael's so-called normal moments</i>

389
00:32:21,756 --> 00:32:23,189
<i>are becoming fewer and fewer,</i>

390
00:32:23,257 --> 00:32:25,589
<i>and I'm particularly worried about this.</i>

391
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:30,256
<i>I believe that these masks have
begun to create a mental sanctuary</i>

392
00:32:30,331 --> 00:32:34,858
<i>in which Michael can hide
within himself and from himself.</i>

393
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:40,997
# Deck the halls with boughs of holly,
Fa la la la la, la la la la #

394
00:32:41,075 --> 00:32:43,941
Fuck you! Fuck you all!

395
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:45,705
- I hate you!
- Let it out!

396
00:32:45,779 --> 00:32:47,371
Shut the fuck up!

397
00:32:47,447 --> 00:32:49,347
I gotta get out of here.

398
00:32:49,416 --> 00:32:52,647
Just let me out!
I hate this world!

399
00:32:52,719 --> 00:32:55,381
- I don't want to be here anymore.
- I know. It's okay.

400
00:32:55,454 --> 00:32:57,650
- I just want to go home.
- It's okay. It's okay.

401
00:32:57,724 --> 00:32:58,952
It's okay.

402
00:33:00,092 --> 00:33:02,356
Why can't I just go home?

403
00:33:02,428 --> 00:33:03,759
Okay.

404
00:33:03,829 --> 00:33:06,229
Okay. Okay. Okay.

405
00:33:06,298 --> 00:33:07,822
I'm afraid you can't go home.

406
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,833
Why?

407
00:33:09,901 --> 00:33:11,596
Because you've done terrible things.

408
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,606
Come here. Come on.

409
00:33:19,244 --> 00:33:21,678
It's okay. It's okay, Michael.

410
00:33:21,746 --> 00:33:23,509
<i>Michael's downward slide</i>

411
00:33:23,581 --> 00:33:26,311
<i>into this hellish abyss continues.</i>

412
00:33:26,384 --> 00:33:30,047
<i>I fear he's on the verge
of completely shutting down.</i>

413
00:33:30,121 --> 00:33:34,056
I managed to persuade the suits
to let you come outside

414
00:33:34,124 --> 00:33:35,887
and sit out in the garden.

415
00:33:35,959 --> 00:33:37,893
All right, gardens.

416
00:33:37,961 --> 00:33:42,295
Hardly a charming place,
but at least there's a bit of greenery.

417
00:33:42,366 --> 00:33:45,334
But please, I mean,
if you don't communicate with me,

418
00:33:45,401 --> 00:33:47,165
how can I help you?

419
00:33:47,237 --> 00:33:49,227
I'm here to help you.

420
00:33:49,305 --> 00:33:52,206
I feel an utter failure at the moment,

421
00:33:52,275 --> 00:33:55,142
that I just can't get through to you.

422
00:33:55,211 --> 00:33:57,941
And you know, they're going
to see in my reports

423
00:33:58,014 --> 00:34:00,244
that you're not responding, and--

424
00:34:00,316 --> 00:34:02,511
you know, they may
take me off the case.

425
00:34:02,585 --> 00:34:04,382
I don't know. I hope not.

426
00:34:04,453 --> 00:34:07,285
I need to get out of here.

427
00:34:09,593 --> 00:34:12,288
Yes, that's not going to happen
for a while, Michael.

428
00:34:15,932 --> 00:34:18,400
Michael, take off the mask.

429
00:34:21,736 --> 00:34:24,330
Honey, you don't look good.
You have to eat. Come on.

430
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,707
- Put my mask back on.
- Michael.

431
00:34:28,777 --> 00:34:30,904
Please put my mask back on.

432
00:34:33,215 --> 00:34:36,206
Come on.
Let's try to enjoy the day.

433
00:34:37,518 --> 00:34:39,487
<i>[Loomis]
The child christened Michael Myers</i>

434
00:34:39,554 --> 00:34:41,646
<i>has become a sort of ghost,</i>

435
00:34:41,722 --> 00:34:45,021
<i>a mere shape of a human being.</i>

436
00:34:45,092 --> 00:34:47,253
<i>There's nothing left here now.</i>

437
00:35:11,416 --> 00:35:15,750
Well, before I go,
I brought you something.

438
00:35:18,557 --> 00:35:21,720
I found it. I thought you might like
to hang it up in your room.

439
00:35:23,295 --> 00:35:24,819
I thought you'd like it.

440
00:35:35,306 --> 00:35:36,967
Well, I guess I'll see you next week.

441
00:35:37,041 --> 00:35:38,633
I'll walk you to the car.

442
00:35:42,747 --> 00:35:44,111
Bye, sweetie.

443
00:35:45,549 --> 00:35:48,984
Nurse, sit with Michael.
I'm taking Mrs. Myers to her car.

444
00:35:49,052 --> 00:35:50,747
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

445
00:36:03,832 --> 00:36:04,821
Cute baby.

446
00:36:09,838 --> 00:36:11,829
Couldn't be related to you.

447
00:36:24,054 --> 00:36:27,454
You know, he's been silent now
for two weeks almost.

448
00:36:27,523 --> 00:36:31,084
We really may want to consider
maybe shock treatments.

449
00:36:38,933 --> 00:36:40,629
What happened?
What happened?

450
00:36:40,703 --> 00:36:42,068
What happened there?

451
00:36:42,137 --> 00:36:43,160
Hey!

452
00:38:44,686 --> 00:38:47,348
So you don't fucking talk a lot,
do you, Max?

453
00:38:48,924 --> 00:38:50,824
Goddamn it, we're gonna get
one thing straight.

454
00:38:50,892 --> 00:38:52,519
I don't work for you.

455
00:38:52,594 --> 00:38:54,720
You may have worked here
for many years

456
00:38:54,796 --> 00:38:56,126
and done all manner of things,

457
00:38:56,198 --> 00:38:58,495
and I suppose that's because
you're a hard worker.

458
00:38:58,566 --> 00:39:00,329
Most of you people are.

459
00:39:00,402 --> 00:39:02,528
All your women keep
your little bungalows clean,

460
00:39:02,603 --> 00:39:04,503
sweep off the dirt floors--

461
00:39:04,572 --> 00:39:06,437
keep the papooses in order and all--

462
00:39:06,574 --> 00:39:09,566
but I'm my own boss, all right?

463
00:39:09,643 --> 00:39:11,941
I retire in about three months,

464
00:39:12,012 --> 00:39:14,537
and you're still gonna be here
for a long time.

465
00:39:14,615 --> 00:39:16,548
Now open the door.

466
00:39:16,616 --> 00:39:19,380
Don't take no orders from anybody.

467
00:39:23,389 --> 00:39:26,358
Let's go, fuck-nut. Time to go.

468
00:39:33,465 --> 00:39:36,457
- Hey! Don't touch those.
- What?

469
00:39:36,535 --> 00:39:38,833
He doesn't like it
when you touch the masks.

470
00:39:38,904 --> 00:39:41,429
God damn, I wouldn't want
the bum to freak out.

471
00:39:41,507 --> 00:39:43,838
Sorry about these chains, Mikey.

472
00:39:43,908 --> 00:39:46,433
What do you mean,
you're sorry about these chains?

473
00:39:46,511 --> 00:39:48,742
You got feelings for this big idiot,
is that what it is?

474
00:39:48,814 --> 00:39:51,714
What's the dig goin' on, Ismael?
What the fuck, man?

475
00:39:51,782 --> 00:39:55,684
You know what? I've been taking care
of this kid for almost 20 years.

476
00:39:55,753 --> 00:39:57,380
And me and him--

477
00:39:57,455 --> 00:39:59,082
You know what? Never mind.
Just shut up, man.

478
00:39:59,156 --> 00:40:01,089
Just keep your hands off his things.

479
00:40:01,158 --> 00:40:02,591
Don't look at me.

480
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:06,151
I'll be a shitstorm
in your worst nightmare, motherfucker.

481
00:40:06,229 --> 00:40:09,357
I'll come in here and fuck this place up
one night, you watch.

482
00:40:18,775 --> 00:40:22,404
I really don't know what else to say, Michael.

483
00:40:22,479 --> 00:40:26,745
You haven't said a word for 15 years.

484
00:40:26,815 --> 00:40:29,682
Christ, that's a lifetime.

485
00:40:31,421 --> 00:40:36,084
That's nearly twice as long
as my first marriage.

486
00:40:36,158 --> 00:40:38,286
Wow.

487
00:40:38,361 --> 00:40:40,157
It's strange, Michael.

488
00:40:42,665 --> 00:40:45,293
In a weird way, you've become like...

489
00:40:46,969 --> 00:40:48,959
...like my best friend.

490
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,107
It just shows you how fucked up my life is.

491
00:40:56,278 --> 00:40:59,644
I've done all I possibly can for you.

492
00:40:59,714 --> 00:41:03,445
So I'm sorry to tell you

493
00:41:03,518 --> 00:41:06,146
that this is going to be my last day.

494
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:08,347
Michael...

495
00:41:08,456 --> 00:41:09,753
I have to move on.

496
00:41:11,926 --> 00:41:13,621
I'm sorry.

497
00:41:29,775 --> 00:41:31,744
Take care, Michael.

498
00:41:35,047 --> 00:41:36,674
Take care.

499
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:01,837
These eyes will deceive you.

500
00:42:04,175 --> 00:42:07,076
They will destroy you.

501
00:42:07,145 --> 00:42:10,841
They will take from you your innocence...

502
00:42:10,914 --> 00:42:13,144
your pride...

503
00:42:13,217 --> 00:42:16,344
and eventually your soul.

504
00:42:16,419 --> 00:42:21,584
These eyes do not see
what you and I see.

505
00:42:23,459 --> 00:42:28,624
Behind these eyes
one finds only blackness,

506
00:42:28,698 --> 00:42:31,690
the absence of light.

507
00:42:31,768 --> 00:42:35,965
These are the eyes...

508
00:42:36,038 --> 00:42:38,700
of a psychopath.

509
00:42:38,774 --> 00:42:40,676
Michael was created

510
00:42:40,744 --> 00:42:42,938
by a perfect alignment

511
00:42:43,012 --> 00:42:46,175
of interior and exterior factors

512
00:42:46,249 --> 00:42:48,843
gone violently wrong--

513
00:42:48,918 --> 00:42:53,685
a perfect storm, if you will.

514
00:42:53,756 --> 00:42:56,452
Thus creating a psychopath

515
00:42:56,526 --> 00:42:59,256
that knows no boundaries...

516
00:42:59,328 --> 00:43:02,353
and has no boundaries.

517
00:43:09,937 --> 00:43:11,735
Kendall, I really don't appreciate

518
00:43:11,807 --> 00:43:13,570
being called out of
my favorite watering hole

519
00:43:13,642 --> 00:43:15,939
to come down on
the fuckin' graveyard shift.

520
00:43:16,011 --> 00:43:18,809
If you do me dirt on this one,
I'll fuckin' hold it against you.

521
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,074
Hey, you know what? I'll fuck her.
You don't want to fuck her?

522
00:43:21,148 --> 00:43:23,173
I'll fuck her. Right here.

523
00:43:28,789 --> 00:43:31,485
Mikey, Mikey, Mikey.

524
00:43:31,559 --> 00:43:34,049
Here we go.
I want you to meet Cousin Noel.

525
00:43:38,331 --> 00:43:40,993
- Hi, there, sweetie. Hi.
- Huh?

526
00:43:41,067 --> 00:43:42,967
Oh, we're just here to look in on you.

527
00:43:43,036 --> 00:43:45,265
We know it's your first night and all.

528
00:43:45,337 --> 00:43:48,238
We just want to see how you are. Oh!

529
00:43:48,307 --> 00:43:50,571
- Aren't you a pretty little thing?
- Not bad, huh?

530
00:43:50,642 --> 00:43:52,269
We're just makin' sure everything's okay.

531
00:43:52,344 --> 00:43:54,869
Oh, now, we're okay. Hey.
Ooh, look at those little titties.

532
00:43:54,947 --> 00:43:56,380
You're right!
Oh, look at there.

533
00:43:56,548 --> 00:43:57,674
- What else is under there?

534
00:43:57,750 --> 00:44:00,150
No, no, no, no, no.
Oh, yeah! Whoo!

535
00:44:00,219 --> 00:44:02,049
We got ourselves a fighter!

536
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,610
A fresh one!
You done good, cousin.

537
00:44:03,688 --> 00:44:04,814
Hah-hah!

538
00:44:04,889 --> 00:44:06,220
- I got an idea.
- Okay.

539
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:10,192
I got me a fuckin' bona fide,
sure as shit idea!

540
00:44:10,261 --> 00:44:12,855
- Keep her fuckin' quiet.
- God, shut up.

541
00:44:17,201 --> 00:44:19,726
Oh, Mikey, Mikey, Mikey, Mikey, Mikey.

542
00:44:19,804 --> 00:44:21,169
Hello, Mike!

543
00:44:23,775 --> 00:44:26,265
Hey, Mikey. We brought you
a little company.

544
00:44:26,343 --> 00:44:28,675
Yeah, we got you
some new, fresh meat, baby.

545
00:44:28,745 --> 00:44:31,213
Fuckin' bitch.
You want some of that?

546
00:44:31,281 --> 00:44:33,215
- Come on, baby!

547
00:44:33,283 --> 00:44:34,749
- Show us you're a man, huh?

548
00:44:34,817 --> 00:44:36,445
You want some fuckin' pussy?

549
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,817
Yeah.

550
00:44:38,888 --> 00:44:40,880
You want some fuckin' pussy, huh?

551
00:44:42,359 --> 00:44:45,623
Yeah. Mm, that's good.
How 'bout some of that, killer?

552
00:44:45,694 --> 00:44:46,820
He ain't gonna do it.
Let me lick--

553
00:44:48,565 --> 00:44:49,827
Let me just--

554
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:51,367
- You wanna fuckin' fight, huh?

555
00:44:51,434 --> 00:44:54,197
- Come on, bitch.
- Fuck the shit outta her.

556
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:56,364
- Come on! Get on her!
- Yeah, baby!

557
00:45:15,557 --> 00:45:17,492
You fucking tard-ass faggot, come on!

558
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:18,753
Yeah!

559
00:45:25,433 --> 00:45:26,865
You a faggot, boy?

560
00:45:30,704 --> 00:45:32,331
You a faggot, huh?

561
00:45:34,041 --> 00:45:35,133
What the fuck?

562
00:45:35,209 --> 00:45:37,700
Hey, you son of a bitch!

563
00:45:37,778 --> 00:45:39,302
Son of a bitch!
Let him go.

564
00:45:39,379 --> 00:45:40,903
Kendall!

565
00:45:43,749 --> 00:45:45,911
What the fuck, Mikey?
It's Kendall.

566
00:45:47,321 --> 00:45:48,515
It's Kendall, Mikey.

567
00:46:52,181 --> 00:46:53,842
Gloria?

569
00:47:39,126 --> 00:47:42,583
Mikey, what are you doing
out of your room?

570
00:47:44,799 --> 00:47:45,959
Okay...

571
00:47:48,068 --> 00:47:50,037
Now, don't do nothing

572
00:47:50,104 --> 00:47:53,402
we're both gonna regret later,
okay, Mikey?

573
00:47:53,473 --> 00:47:56,601
I'm gonna have to get you back
into your room, okay now?

574
00:47:57,877 --> 00:48:00,107
Let me get these.

575
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:01,909
I'm just gonna...

576
00:48:01,982 --> 00:48:03,949
get these handcuffs and...

577
00:48:05,518 --> 00:48:07,747
I'm gonna try to put these handcuffs
on you right now, Mikey.

578
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:10,789
And then we'll get you back
into your own bed, okay?

579
00:48:25,103 --> 00:48:26,195
Mikey!

580
00:48:31,776 --> 00:48:33,971
I was good to you, Mikey.

581
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:50,354
I was good to you, Mikey.

582
00:49:50,584 --> 00:49:51,573
Hello.

583
00:49:51,652 --> 00:49:53,677
<i>- Sam.
- Who is this?</i>

584
00:49:53,754 --> 00:49:55,016
Sam, it's Koplenson.

585
00:49:57,057 --> 00:49:58,046
Who?

586
00:49:58,124 --> 00:50:00,786
<i>Dr. Koplenson from Smith's Grove.</i>

587
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:02,590
He's out.

588
00:50:02,663 --> 00:50:03,686
Michael's out.

589
00:50:03,763 --> 00:50:06,459
Shit. What?

590
00:50:06,532 --> 00:50:09,661
He broke out a few hours ago.

591
00:50:09,736 --> 00:50:12,727
Sam, it's a--
it's a fucking massacre.

592
00:50:14,607 --> 00:50:17,167
I'm coming right away.
All right.

593
00:50:19,044 --> 00:50:20,443
Oh, shit.

594
00:50:20,512 --> 00:50:22,777

Gotta leave the truck.

599
00:50:50,641 --> 00:50:52,632
All right, boys.

600
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:55,974
Grizzley's back in town.
Who's got the Cracker Jacks?

601
00:50:56,045 --> 00:50:58,071
Grizzley's back!

602
00:50:58,148 --> 00:50:59,775
All right!

603
00:50:59,849 --> 00:51:01,009
Look it here.

604
00:51:01,084 --> 00:51:02,881
That's a new paint job.

605
00:51:02,952 --> 00:51:05,580
Don't mess it up. Don't scratch it.

606
00:51:11,361 --> 00:51:12,589
Yeah.

607
00:51:16,666 --> 00:51:18,429
Oh, man.

Naughty, naughty girl.

613
00:52:00,174 --> 00:52:03,631
Hey, buddy,
just to give you a heads up,

614
00:52:03,710 --> 00:52:07,407
I got a taco deluxe supreme
talking back at me,

615
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:08,845
so I'm going to be a while.

616
00:52:08,915 --> 00:52:14,080
So do you mind waiting somewhere else
and let me pass this beast in peace?

617
00:52:22,762 --> 00:52:25,594
Look, brother...

618
00:52:25,664 --> 00:52:27,461
if you're looking for some kind of action,

619
00:52:27,533 --> 00:52:31,799
you better take it on the arches
before I'm done dropping this load.

620
00:52:31,870 --> 00:52:34,736
Or you're going to be one sorry A-hole.

621
00:52:37,675 --> 00:52:39,267
I see.

622
00:52:39,345 --> 00:52:43,371
What we got here is...

623
00:52:43,448 --> 00:52:45,712
a failure to communicate.

624
00:52:47,952 --> 00:52:51,853
You just hold on, Daisy.

625
00:52:51,922 --> 00:52:53,914
I've got something for you.

626
00:52:57,327 --> 00:53:00,091
Let me introduce myself.

627
00:53:00,163 --> 00:53:02,063
I'm Joe Grizzley, bitch.

628
00:53:03,967 --> 00:53:06,868
And I'm going to cut that mask

629
00:53:09,673 --> 00:53:11,230
Get-- Get back!

630
00:53:11,307 --> 00:53:12,934
I ain't scared!

631
00:53:27,691 --> 00:53:29,749

<i># Mr. Sandman... #</i>

00:54:08,796 --> 00:54:10,491
Mason, Laurie!

634
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,695
- Morning.

635
00:54:15,769 --> 00:54:18,260
Where are my goddamn glasses?

636
00:54:18,339 --> 00:54:20,170
- Jesus, Cynth, I'm gonna be late.
- On your head.

637
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,264
- Oh, sh-- I'm gonna lose my mind.
- Move.

638
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:23,536
Excuse me.

639
00:54:26,446 --> 00:54:28,505
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Now what?

640
00:54:28,581 --> 00:54:31,277
It says here Nickel's Hardware
is going out of business.

641
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:33,785
42 years and that's it, over and done.

642
00:54:33,853 --> 00:54:36,343
Yeah, well, good. They're a rip-off.

643
00:54:36,421 --> 00:54:39,653
And Mr. Nickels is a horny old pervert.

644
00:54:39,726 --> 00:54:42,057
Okay, don't even want to know.

645
00:54:42,127 --> 00:54:43,321
Guess what, Mom.

646
00:54:43,395 --> 00:54:46,421
Mr. Nickels likes to touch me
the wrong way.

647
00:54:46,498 --> 00:54:48,329
Ooh, whoo, Mommy!

648
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:49,958
Okay, that is so not funny.

649
00:54:50,035 --> 00:54:51,968
Want a screwdriver, Mommy?
You want a hammer?

650
00:54:52,270 --> 00:54:53,601
Look at this, Mom. Oh!

651
00:54:53,672 --> 00:54:55,469
- Laurie, stop!
- I'm sorry. Okay.

652
00:54:55,539 --> 00:54:58,099
- Are you eating?
- No, I'll get something at school.

653
00:54:58,175 --> 00:54:59,870
- Oh, my God.
- [Dad] Oh, sure.

654
00:54:59,944 --> 00:55:03,209
Just let the faceless marauding
corporate monsters of America

655
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:04,975
destroy everything
beautiful about this town.

656
00:55:05,049 --> 00:55:08,382
Corporate monsters or not,
Epic Mart's a lot cheaper.

657
00:55:08,452 --> 00:55:10,613
Oh, man, I gotta get out of here.

658
00:55:14,524 --> 00:55:17,517
- Thanks again for dropping that thing off.
- No sweat, Dad.

659
00:55:17,595 --> 00:55:20,154
Just shove the envelope
inside the mail slot, okay?

660
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:21,458
Yeah, Dad, I know.

661
00:55:21,531 --> 00:55:23,020
They're coming by to look at it later, honey.

662
00:55:23,099 --> 00:55:24,088
- So, it's very important that--
- Dad, okay.

663
00:55:24,167 --> 00:55:26,398
<i>I understand.
Muy importante.</i>

664
00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:27,528
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

665
00:55:27,605 --> 00:55:28,696
Have a good day.

666
00:55:28,773 --> 00:55:32,538
Mason, you forgot your briefcase, honey.

667
00:55:32,609 --> 00:55:34,770
- Ah, shit.
- Ah, shit.

668
00:55:34,844 --> 00:55:36,277
I feel like "What round is it?"

669
00:55:39,015 --> 00:55:40,141
Yeah.

670
00:55:40,216 --> 00:55:44,208
Oh, uh, you think you could...
glue Mr. Bones' arms on or something?

671
00:55:44,287 --> 00:55:47,620
- Have a good day, baby.
- Yeah. Top on my priority list.

672
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:52,149
Hey, Laurie!

673
00:55:52,227 --> 00:55:53,285
- Wait up!
- Oh, God.

674
00:55:53,362 --> 00:55:56,263
- Leave me alone, Tommy.
- Wait.

675
00:55:56,331 --> 00:55:59,300
Definition: Stop walking.

676
00:55:59,368 --> 00:56:02,735
- Can I ask you something serious?
- Sure, why not?

677
00:56:02,805 --> 00:56:05,170
Did you ever hear
about the Mexican Wolf Man?

678
00:56:05,239 --> 00:56:07,298
- No.
- Yeah, well, he's real.

679
00:56:07,375 --> 00:56:08,899
- I saw him on TV last night...
- Yeah.

680
00:56:08,976 --> 00:56:12,742
And his name's Danny, and his face
is completely covered with hair.

681
00:56:12,814 --> 00:56:14,509
And he likes soccer.
I swear it! They showed--

682
00:56:14,582 --> 00:56:15,640
- Okay.
- He's a wolf!

683
00:56:15,716 --> 00:56:17,979
Tommy, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

684
00:56:18,051 --> 00:56:19,416
Lay off the candy corn, kid.

685
00:56:19,486 --> 00:56:22,011
Stop acting like I'm crazy. It's true!

686
00:56:22,088 --> 00:56:24,114
Tommy, I'm your babysitter.
You're crazy.

687
00:56:24,191 --> 00:56:26,683
- I know this. You're crazy.
- Ooohhh!

688
00:57:52,708 --> 00:57:54,972
All right, gotta make a stop here.

689
00:57:55,044 --> 00:57:58,240
Whoa! What are you, insane?

690
00:57:58,313 --> 00:58:00,747
Oh, my gosh, Tommy,
I'm not even listening to you.

691
00:58:00,815 --> 00:58:02,841
You'd better listen to me.

692
00:58:02,919 --> 00:58:04,113
He's right there.

693
00:58:04,186 --> 00:58:06,278
What are you, crazy?
You can't go in there.

694
00:58:06,354 --> 00:58:08,049
Oh, yes, I can.

695
00:58:08,123 --> 00:58:10,353
Hold my books, please?

696
00:58:11,793 --> 00:58:14,353
That's the devil's house.
The Boogey Man lives in there.

697
00:58:14,429 --> 00:58:16,487
Yeah.
Oh, no, Tommy.

698
00:58:16,564 --> 00:58:18,658
Don't even joke about it.
I'm serious.

699
00:58:18,733 --> 00:58:20,825
Oh, you're scaring me.

700
00:58:20,901 --> 00:58:24,133
The Boogey Man will get me
or Danny the Wolf Man.

701
00:58:30,644 --> 00:58:32,270
Oh, no, Tommy.

702
00:58:32,346 --> 00:58:35,109
Oh, no!

703
00:58:35,182 --> 00:58:36,809
Oh, no, it's pulling me--

704
00:58:36,884 --> 00:58:39,375
Oh, no, Tommy, it's pulling me in!

705
00:58:39,453 --> 00:58:41,386
Ha ha ha.

706
00:58:42,088 --> 00:58:43,555
It was just a joke. Chill.

707
00:58:43,624 --> 00:58:45,523
I wish it wasn't.

708
00:58:45,592 --> 00:58:47,423
Come on, hurry up.

709
00:58:47,493 --> 00:58:49,688
Chill, spazz-monkey.

710
00:58:49,762 --> 00:58:50,956
Thanks.

711
00:58:54,033 --> 00:58:56,000
That's no place to screw around,
Laurie.

712
00:58:56,068 --> 00:58:58,593
- It's not a big deal.
- Not a big deal?

713
00:58:58,670 --> 00:59:00,831
Do you know whose house that is?

714
00:59:00,906 --> 00:59:02,203
Come on.

715
00:59:02,274 --> 00:59:04,367
- It's going to be fine.
- Yeah.

716
00:59:04,443 --> 00:59:05,876
What if something happens?

717
00:59:05,943 --> 00:59:08,707
- Laurie, what is going to happen?
- I don't know.

718
00:59:08,779 --> 00:59:10,441
It's going to be fine.

719
00:59:10,515 --> 00:59:12,744
What is going to be fine?

720
00:59:12,817 --> 00:59:16,151
Annie wants me to pretend
to baby-sit Lindsey Wallace,

721
00:59:16,221 --> 00:59:19,781
then sneak out and dump her with me
so she can go and see Paul.

722
00:59:19,857 --> 00:59:21,222
Sounds like
one of my crafty ideas.

723
00:59:21,292 --> 00:59:22,520
- Yeah.
- I like it.

724
00:59:22,593 --> 00:59:25,460
Anyway, I thought Paul was, like, grounded
for trashing his dad's motorcycle.

725
00:59:25,528 --> 00:59:27,520
Oh, yeah.
No, he was, but he got out of it.

726
00:59:27,598 --> 00:59:28,860
- You know.
- Yeah.

727
00:59:28,933 --> 00:59:31,196
Please?

728
00:59:31,267 --> 00:59:32,632
What if they come home early?

729
00:59:32,702 --> 00:59:35,364
Dude, they are not
going to come home early.

730
00:59:35,438 --> 00:59:37,235
Okay? Mrs. Wallace is a lush.

731
00:59:37,307 --> 00:59:40,299
They're going to be out all night
getting hammered.

732
00:59:40,377 --> 00:59:43,245
Yeah. Annie, I really hate lying.
You know that.

733
00:59:43,314 --> 00:59:45,874
God, what are you, Mother Teresa?

734
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:47,281
- No.
- Yes, she is.

735
00:59:47,351 --> 00:59:48,978
Look at her.
She's like a little angel.

736
00:59:49,052 --> 00:59:52,887
- She's Mother-fucking Teresa.
- Stop. I am not!

737
00:59:52,956 --> 00:59:54,446
Please?

738
00:59:57,227 --> 00:59:59,161
- All right, I'll do it.
- Yes!

739
00:59:59,229 --> 01:00:00,423
You owe me big time.

740
01:00:00,497 --> 01:00:02,430
- I love you.
- I love you.

741
01:00:04,733 --> 01:00:08,534
Did you know that ethyl alcohol
boils at 78.5 degrees Celsius?

742
01:00:08,604 --> 01:00:10,071
- I didn't know that.
- Yeah.

743
01:00:10,139 --> 01:00:11,606
That's pretty cool, right?

744
01:00:12,608 --> 01:00:13,700
Call me back.

745
01:00:17,112 --> 01:00:18,943
This is all your fault.

746
01:00:19,013 --> 01:00:20,844
I mean, you're responsible.

747
01:00:22,283 --> 01:00:27,311
I cannot be responsible
for everything that goes on in here.

748
01:00:27,388 --> 01:00:28,855
- What about you?
- No, no, no, no.

749
01:00:28,923 --> 01:00:30,890
You're not pinning this on me.

750
01:00:30,958 --> 01:00:34,654
- He was your patient, Doctor.
- Was my patient.

751
01:00:34,728 --> 01:00:38,187
Look, all you guys had to do
was to play zoo-keeper.

752
01:00:38,266 --> 01:00:41,723
Just keep the monkeyhouse locked
until the monkey died of old age.

753
01:00:41,802 --> 01:00:43,269
How difficult is that?

754
01:00:43,336 --> 01:00:47,170
Christ, you can barely tell
he's breathing half the time.

755
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:51,040
He's been like a comatose kitty
for 15 years.

756
01:00:51,111 --> 01:00:53,944
If our security wasn't sufficient, Sammy,

757
01:00:54,014 --> 01:00:55,810
you should have warned us.

758
01:00:55,881 --> 01:01:00,147
I see. So you're just going
to wash your hands of the whole thing.

759
01:01:00,219 --> 01:01:03,052
You know, you two make me sick.

760
01:01:11,196 --> 01:01:15,530
"He is mad that trusts
in the tameness of a wolf."

761
01:01:17,235 --> 01:01:19,863
We've given the authorities
his complete profile.

762
01:01:19,938 --> 01:01:23,430
Two road blocks and an all-points bulletin
wouldn't stop a 5-year-old.

763
01:01:23,508 --> 01:01:25,169
Well, what do you want us to do?

764
01:01:25,243 --> 01:01:27,233
Yes. I mean,
what do you want us to do?

765
01:01:28,712 --> 01:01:30,681
I want you to get on the phone,

766
01:01:30,748 --> 01:01:34,446
and I want you to tell them
who broke out of here last night.

767
01:01:34,519 --> 01:01:37,976
And I want you to tell them
exactly where he's going.

768
01:01:38,055 --> 01:01:39,522
Christ, we don't know where he's going.

769
01:01:39,590 --> 01:01:41,683
It must be great living in denial.

770
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:43,351
I must try it sometime.

771
01:01:43,427 --> 01:01:47,123
Look, you and that army
of shirt-tuckers up there,

772
01:01:47,197 --> 01:01:49,164
you know damn well where he's going.

773
01:01:50,934 --> 01:01:51,958
And where is that?

774
01:01:55,339 --> 01:01:57,170
Haddonfield!

775
01:01:57,241 --> 01:02:00,005
Haddonfield's a hundred miles
away from here.

776
01:02:01,278 --> 01:02:02,539
This is so fucked.

777
01:02:02,612 --> 01:02:04,739
What, me suspended from the squad?

778
01:02:04,814 --> 01:02:06,008
I don't mean to sound conceited,

779
01:02:06,082 --> 01:02:08,243
but I'm, like, the fucking hottest
cheerleader they've got.

780
01:02:08,317 --> 01:02:10,046
Yeah, Lynda,
that doesn't sound conceited.

781
01:02:10,119 --> 01:02:12,019
What, so now nobody
can take a joke anymore?

782
01:02:12,088 --> 01:02:13,715
- What did you say?
- Check it.

783
01:02:13,789 --> 01:02:16,383
So Lady Fuck-face gives us
three new cheers to learn,

784
01:02:16,458 --> 01:02:20,417
so I'm like, "Hey, why don't we just
rock it commando, flash some snatch?

785
01:02:20,495 --> 01:02:22,555
And maybe nobody will notice
we're doing the same old tired cheers."

786
01:02:22,632 --> 01:02:24,565
- Oh, you didn't.
- Oh, yeah, I did.

787
01:02:24,633 --> 01:02:25,622
- Yeah, you did.
- Yeah.

788
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:27,395
You know what that
dried-up fucking bitch did?

789
01:02:27,469 --> 01:02:30,165
- What?
- Calls my dad and tells him what I said.

790
01:02:30,238 --> 01:02:31,227
- Yeah.
- Oh, my gosh.

791
01:02:31,306 --> 01:02:34,537
That C-U-N-T, yeah,
needs to get laid.

792
01:02:34,609 --> 01:02:36,235
What did your dad say?

793
01:02:36,310 --> 01:02:37,538
Oh, who cares?

794
01:02:37,611 --> 01:02:41,377
I'll just give him the little sweetie-pants
princess suck-up routine.

795
01:02:41,448 --> 01:02:44,679
Daddy's little pookie would never
say something like that.

796
01:02:44,752 --> 01:02:46,515
Gosh, ever since your parents split up,

797
01:02:46,587 --> 01:02:48,646
you have your dad
wrapped around your little finger.

798
01:02:48,722 --> 01:02:50,952
Totally wrapped.

799
01:02:51,025 --> 01:02:53,550
- Hey, bitches!
- Hey, Annie.

800
01:02:53,627 --> 01:02:57,289
- Thanks for waiting for me.
- Whatever. Hurry your ass up.

801
01:02:57,363 --> 01:02:59,092
God.

802
01:02:59,166 --> 01:03:02,396
Hey, I heard about your
little cheerleading incident.

803
01:03:02,468 --> 01:03:04,697
Yeah, I'm totally famous.

804
01:03:04,770 --> 01:03:06,398
You're totally a slut.

805
01:03:06,472 --> 01:03:07,996
Yeah.

806
01:03:08,074 --> 01:03:09,904
Anyway, today in class,
in French class,

807
01:03:09,975 --> 01:03:11,944
Mr. Leclerc was totally
flirting with me.

808
01:03:12,011 --> 01:03:15,912
- God, here we go!
- We were conjugating the verb "to want."

809
01:03:15,981 --> 01:03:19,747
<i>- Because he so wants you!
- Je veuxl Je veuxl</i>

810
01:03:19,818 --> 01:03:22,616
- Oh, my gosh.
- Bare Leclerc.

811
01:03:22,688 --> 01:03:24,314
Bare Leclerc wants me.

812
01:03:24,388 --> 01:03:26,289
I think that guy's watching us.

813
01:03:26,358 --> 01:03:28,019
- What guy?
- That guy over there.

814
01:03:28,093 --> 01:03:29,185
Yeah?

815
01:03:29,261 --> 01:03:31,057
- Oh, please.
- I saw him outside school earlier.

816
01:03:31,128 --> 01:03:33,154
Probably just some pervert
cruising school poontang.

817
01:03:33,232 --> 01:03:35,290
Yeah, wait. Watch this.

818
01:03:35,366 --> 01:03:36,890
Hey, freak!

819
01:03:36,968 --> 01:03:38,833
Hey, freak, you want
some of the young stuff?

820
01:03:38,903 --> 01:03:40,803
You like that?
Well, come and get it.

821
01:03:40,872 --> 01:03:41,998
- Hey!
- Lynda, stop.

822
01:03:42,073 --> 01:03:44,405
Hey, asshole.
My daddy's the sheriff.

823
01:03:44,475 --> 01:03:46,874
Huh? Why don't you go crawl back
under your fucking rock?

824
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:49,503
- Yeah, whatever.
- See, I told you.

825
01:03:49,579 --> 01:03:51,514
He's just some
stupid fucking pervert.

826
01:03:51,582 --> 01:03:53,606
- Total pervert.
- Gosh, you guys are crazy.

827
01:03:53,683 --> 01:03:54,945
That guy could have been dangerous.

828
01:03:55,018 --> 01:03:56,246
- Oh, God.
- Whatever.

829
01:03:56,319 --> 01:03:58,117
- What is he going to do?
- I don't know.

830
01:03:58,188 --> 01:04:01,681
Oh, my God.
You should date him!

831
01:04:03,127 --> 01:04:05,060
- You should!
- You guys!

832
01:04:07,430 --> 01:04:09,455
- Oh, no, 5-0.
- Hey.

833
01:04:09,532 --> 01:04:11,090
Hi, Dad.

834
01:04:11,167 --> 01:04:12,691
Hey, Mr. Brackett.

835
01:04:12,769 --> 01:04:15,670
- Nice furry hat, Mr. Brackett.
- Thank you.

836
01:04:15,739 --> 01:04:17,001
What's up, Dad?

837
01:04:17,073 --> 01:04:19,769
I'm on my way home.
Anybody want a ride?

838
01:04:19,843 --> 01:04:21,310
Yeah. Hell, yeah, I'll take a ride.

839
01:04:21,378 --> 01:04:22,538
- No.
- You guys?

840
01:04:22,612 --> 01:04:24,102
Bacon-mobiles make me nauseous.

841
01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:25,737
- Nice.
- Bye, Annie.

842
01:04:25,814 --> 01:04:27,281
- See you later.
- Bye, guys.

843
01:04:27,349 --> 01:04:29,214
Hey, kiddo.

844
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:35,522
- Kind of a drag having a pig as a dad.
- Nah, I like him.

845
01:04:35,591 --> 01:04:38,059
Yeah? Do you think
he was flirting with me?

846
01:04:38,127 --> 01:04:39,957
- You are so demented.
- Totally.

847
01:04:40,028 --> 01:04:42,327
- Yeah. See ya.
- Bye.

848
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:21,164
- I hate you!

849
01:05:26,305 --> 01:05:28,431
Aw, how cute.

850
01:05:28,506 --> 01:05:30,668
Would you please help me
with this stupid thing?

851
01:05:30,742 --> 01:05:32,573
Okay, okay, okay.

852
01:05:32,644 --> 01:05:35,738
Jeez. Mom, why do you
deal with this every year?

853
01:05:35,814 --> 01:05:37,873
Because for some unbelievable reason,

854
01:05:37,949 --> 01:05:40,713
your father likes it.

855
01:05:40,785 --> 01:05:42,809
- The feet look like the hands--
- It's not working.

856
01:05:42,886 --> 01:05:46,084
And the hands like the feet,
and I can't get the thing in the hole, and--

857
01:05:46,157 --> 01:05:49,182
- Oh, I can't get it!
- Calm down, I'm helping--

858
01:05:49,259 --> 01:05:50,624
Oh, I got it.

859
01:05:52,196 --> 01:05:53,663
- You got it?
- Will you try and get those right?

860
01:05:53,731 --> 01:05:55,198
Okay, I'll try.

861
01:05:55,265 --> 01:05:56,425
Oh, jeez.

862
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:59,662
I've been out here
for two hours doing this.

863
01:05:59,736 --> 01:06:01,705
There.

864
01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:04,239
- Hey, do you want me to get--
- Just hang himself. No!

865
01:06:04,308 --> 01:06:07,039
I'm still upset about the whole
bagel thing this morning,

866
01:06:07,112 --> 01:06:08,100
if you want to know the truth.

867
01:06:08,178 --> 01:06:09,338
Mom, that was a joke.

868
01:06:09,413 --> 01:06:10,778
- Oh, yeah. Well, let me tell you.
- It was a joke.

869
01:06:10,848 --> 01:06:12,713
There are some things
moms don't need to hear.

870
01:06:12,783 --> 01:06:14,375
- Yeah, I'm 17.
- I know you're 17.

871
01:06:14,451 --> 01:06:17,249
You're the best, Mom.

872
01:06:22,726 --> 01:06:24,556
Yeah, it's right over here.

873
01:06:25,962 --> 01:06:27,862
Yeah. Hello?

874
01:06:27,930 --> 01:06:30,330
Yes, uh, Sheriff Brackett, please.

875
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:34,268
Dr. Samuel Loomis.
Yeah. Hello? He--

876
01:06:34,337 --> 01:06:38,898
Oh, sh-- ugh!
Can I borrow your cell phone?

877
01:06:38,974 --> 01:06:41,534
This thing's about as useful
as a row of Christmas puddings.

878
01:06:41,610 --> 01:06:43,601
Oh, no. I don't have one.

879
01:06:43,679 --> 01:06:45,236
Causes brain cancer.

880
01:06:45,313 --> 01:06:47,042
Oh, yeah. Right.

881
01:06:47,182 --> 01:06:50,548
You know, I remember this mess
just like it happened yesterday?

882
01:06:50,618 --> 01:06:51,983
It was tragic.

883
01:06:52,053 --> 01:06:53,851
The poor woman,
I guess she couldn't stand the stress

884
01:06:53,922 --> 01:06:56,856
of being labeled "Satan's mother."

885
01:06:56,924 --> 01:06:59,359
I think she blew her fucking head off.

886
01:06:59,428 --> 01:07:01,258
I'm still amazed.

887
01:07:01,328 --> 01:07:04,819
A young boy like that
butchering all those people.

888
01:07:04,899 --> 01:07:08,766
And the doctor involved--
I think he wrote a book or something.

889
01:07:08,835 --> 01:07:10,325
Fucking blood money.

890
01:07:10,403 --> 01:07:12,167
Yeah, I read that book.
It was a masterpiece.

891
01:07:12,239 --> 01:07:14,901
- Now, are we close?
- Yes, it's just here. I gu--

892
01:07:16,409 --> 01:07:18,570
- Goddamn son of a bitch!
- What?

893
01:07:18,645 --> 01:07:21,443
Those fucking kids!
Jesus Christ!

894
01:07:21,514 --> 01:07:25,109
Don't they think I have anything better to do
with my time than clean up this shit?

895
01:07:25,185 --> 01:07:27,175
Fucking little idiots! God damn it!

896
01:07:27,252 --> 01:07:28,914
Where the hell are you going?

897
01:07:31,156 --> 01:07:34,717
Who would do sick shit like this?

898
01:07:34,793 --> 01:07:37,626
I think I know whose grave that is.

899
01:08:08,592 --> 01:08:12,119
Dude, it fucking totally sucks
that they're selling this place.

900
01:08:12,195 --> 01:08:14,721
It's reduced.
Maybe I can buy it.

901
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:17,666
Yeah, with like, your $10 you have
in your piggy bank?

902
01:08:19,436 --> 01:08:21,428
It's a shithole anyway.

903
01:08:21,506 --> 01:08:22,995
I'm going to miss it.

904
01:08:23,073 --> 01:08:24,132
Don't worry, dude.

905
01:08:24,208 --> 01:08:26,573
We'll find another house to party in.

906
01:08:26,643 --> 01:08:29,612
Besides, I'm gonna
get the van all jacked up.

907
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:32,443
You're gonna want to spend
more time in there anyway.

908
01:08:49,932 --> 01:08:51,331
Wait, wait!

909
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:53,561
Wait, just like that.

910
01:08:53,636 --> 01:08:56,069
Oh, God.

911
01:08:56,137 --> 01:08:57,229
Oh, wait. Wait.

912
01:08:57,305 --> 01:08:58,397
Right there, right there.

913
01:08:58,473 --> 01:09:01,271
- Hold on!
- Wait, my calf is cramping, man.

914
01:09:01,342 --> 01:09:03,071
Why'd you stop?
Oh, God--

915
01:09:03,144 --> 01:09:05,009
Oh, fuck.

916
01:09:09,817 --> 01:09:11,875
A fucking little warning would be nice.

917
01:09:11,953 --> 01:09:14,614
- Fuck.
- I'm sorry.

918
01:09:14,688 --> 01:09:16,656
Jesus.

919
01:09:20,427 --> 01:09:22,793
- Get me another beer.
- You get it.

920
01:09:22,863 --> 01:09:25,423
I'm the one that just did all the heavy lifting.

921
01:09:27,233 --> 01:09:28,700
All right, I'll go.

922
01:09:32,972 --> 01:09:37,602
So, seriously, on a scale from 1 to 10,
should I have a 5?

923
01:09:37,677 --> 01:09:42,080
How about... zero?

924
01:09:42,148 --> 01:09:43,308
- More like--
- Zero.

925
01:09:43,382 --> 01:09:44,610
More like zero plus 11.

926
01:10:24,055 --> 01:10:26,249
- Hello?
- Yo, Mama.

927
01:10:26,323 --> 01:10:28,086
What up, dude?

928
01:10:28,158 --> 01:10:30,955
<i>- Nothing much.
- Oh, what's wrong?</i>

929
01:10:31,028 --> 01:10:33,552
I was just thinking about
what Annie said earlier today,

930
01:10:33,630 --> 01:10:35,963
concerning my so-called
"cheerleading incident."

931
01:10:36,032 --> 01:10:37,863
I don't know.
It's kind of bumming me out.

932
01:10:40,336 --> 01:10:43,271
Fuck, dude, who put
all the empties back in here?

933
01:10:44,607 --> 01:10:45,938
You don't think that, do you?

934
01:10:46,009 --> 01:10:47,271
Lynda, I don't think you're a slut.

935
01:10:47,343 --> 01:10:48,776
Come on, that's ridiculous.

936
01:10:48,845 --> 01:10:51,473
I don't give a shit what Annie thinks anyway.

937
01:10:51,547 --> 01:10:52,673
But I care what you think.

938
01:10:53,181 --> 01:10:54,808
Aww!

939
01:11:10,398 --> 01:11:11,387
Fuck!

940
01:11:12,933 --> 01:11:14,400
What-- What the f--

941
01:11:57,176 --> 01:12:00,668
Jesus, Bob, could you move
your pokey ass a little slower?

942
01:12:00,746 --> 01:12:02,076
Well, could you?

943
01:12:06,984 --> 01:12:08,383
Well, that's cute.

944
01:12:09,787 --> 01:12:12,619
See anything you like?

945
01:12:20,964 --> 01:12:22,626
Okay, enough.

946
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:24,133
Joke's over.

947
01:12:24,202 --> 01:12:25,828
Beer, please.

948
01:12:30,641 --> 01:12:33,974
Hey, Casper the Friendly Asshole Ghost,
hand me my beer.

949
01:12:36,446 --> 01:12:38,574
Well, fucking hand it over, dip-shit.

950
01:12:41,551 --> 01:12:44,384
Why do you have to become
such a fucking jerk every time we do it?

951
01:12:44,454 --> 01:12:47,218
You think you'd be grateful
that I let you touch me with that thing.

952
01:12:47,290 --> 01:12:48,655
And anyway, you're not a zero.

953
01:12:48,725 --> 01:12:51,193
You're a fucking minus 5 or something.

954
01:12:51,261 --> 01:12:52,523
Whatever.

955
01:12:52,596 --> 01:12:54,154
What'd you do to this beer?

956
01:13:36,603 --> 01:13:39,003
What about this big one here?
That looks perfect.

957
01:13:39,072 --> 01:13:40,596
- You mean, like, this one here?
- Yeah, that one.

958
01:13:40,674 --> 01:13:43,575
- Yes, yes, that's lovely.
- .22 Smith & Wesson.

959
01:13:43,644 --> 01:13:45,474
- That's good.
- Yeah.

960
01:13:45,545 --> 01:13:47,639
That's okay if you want to just piss it off.

961
01:13:47,713 --> 01:13:51,444
If you want to blow its fucking head off...

962
01:13:51,518 --> 01:13:52,814
this is what you want.

963
01:13:52,886 --> 01:13:54,750
.357 Magnum.

964
01:13:54,821 --> 01:13:57,187
Wolff mainspring, polygonal rifling.

965
01:13:57,256 --> 01:13:58,723
Beautiful, beautiful.
Poly what?

966
01:13:58,791 --> 01:14:01,521
- Muzzle velocity of 1,450 feet per second.
- Great, just wrap it up.

967
01:14:01,594 --> 01:14:02,925
- That's fine.
- Okay, okay.

968
01:14:02,995 --> 01:14:04,587
- Take it easy.
- Thank you. Yes.

969
01:14:04,664 --> 01:14:05,756
I'm in a bit of a hurry.

970
01:14:05,832 --> 01:14:07,321
If you could just wrap it up,
that'd be great.

971
01:14:07,399 --> 01:14:08,889
- Thank you.
- What are we hunting?

972
01:14:08,967 --> 01:14:13,028
- Girls, you look so beautiful.
- Little princesses.

973
01:14:13,104 --> 01:14:14,093
- Trick or treat.
- Here you go.

974
01:14:14,172 --> 01:14:15,195
- Thank you.
- Here's some candy.

975
01:14:15,272 --> 01:14:17,571
- Oh, Happy Halloween.
- You, too.

976
01:14:17,642 --> 01:14:20,304
- Bye, you guys.
- Thank you. Bye.

977
01:14:21,879 --> 01:14:23,676
So cute.

978
01:14:23,747 --> 01:14:26,341
I cannot believe you're graduating this year.

979
01:14:26,417 --> 01:14:29,147
I remember when you used
to run around looking like that.

980
01:14:29,220 --> 01:14:31,154
Mom, I was never a princess.

981
01:14:31,222 --> 01:14:33,485
Last thing I was at their age
was dead Little Red Riding Hood.

982
01:14:33,556 --> 01:14:34,853
You were this beautiful ballerina--

983
01:14:34,924 --> 01:14:37,689
No, you bought me the blood
and you gave me the cuts.

984
01:14:37,761 --> 01:14:39,126
"My costume's too tight."

985
01:14:39,196 --> 01:14:40,788
- You don't remember that?
- I never wore a tutu.

986
01:14:40,865 --> 01:14:42,594
You getting many kids?

987
01:14:42,666 --> 01:14:45,533
Only two so far.

988
01:14:45,603 --> 01:14:48,037
Listen...

989
01:14:48,105 --> 01:14:49,093
be careful tonight.

990
01:14:49,172 --> 01:14:50,162
I know.

991
01:14:50,241 --> 01:14:52,641
A lot of nut cases come out on Halloween.

992
01:14:52,710 --> 01:14:55,906
It's, uh--
What was it you told me to say?

993
01:14:57,380 --> 01:15:00,042
- Amateur night.
- Yeah, that's right. Amateur night.

994
01:15:00,116 --> 01:15:02,243
Dad, I'm just going to be babysitting.

995
01:15:02,318 --> 01:15:03,910
- What's the worst thing I could do?
- All right, okay.

996
01:15:03,987 --> 01:15:05,682
- I'm just saying.
- Nice.

997
01:15:05,755 --> 01:15:06,779
- All right.
- Sorry.

998
01:15:06,856 --> 01:15:08,414
- Aah!
- Mom, st--

999
01:15:12,694 --> 01:15:14,423
Hi, Mr. And Mrs. Strode!

1000
01:15:14,496 --> 01:15:15,622
- Hey, Annie.
- Hey.

1001
01:15:15,697 --> 01:15:16,755
How's your dad?

1002
01:15:16,832 --> 01:15:19,426
Oh, you know, same as always.

1003
01:15:19,501 --> 01:15:21,695
- You know what that means?
- Mm-hmm.

1004
01:15:23,372 --> 01:15:24,839
Yeah. Love you guys!

1005
01:15:24,907 --> 01:15:27,238
- Love you, too!
- Bye-bye!

1006
01:15:27,308 --> 01:15:28,570
Gonna give me some lovin'?

1007
01:15:28,643 --> 01:15:32,943
I'll give you some lovin' later, but first
you're going to talk about the vacation.

1008
01:15:33,014 --> 01:15:36,381
I'm going to go build a fire.

1009
01:15:36,450 --> 01:15:38,145
Vacation.

1010
01:15:38,219 --> 01:15:40,687
I hate vacation. Let's stay home.

1011
01:16:13,052 --> 01:16:14,349
Aaahhh!

1012
01:16:41,311 --> 01:16:43,302
No! No!

1013
01:16:43,380 --> 01:16:46,646
You leave my baby alone, you--

1014
01:17:06,737 --> 01:17:09,205
Okay, Tommy,
here's your jelly sandwich,

1015
01:17:09,272 --> 01:17:11,296
hold the peanut butter.

1016
01:17:11,374 --> 01:17:12,602
Good.

1017
01:17:12,675 --> 01:17:14,575
You know, if you listened to me
the first time,

1018
01:17:14,644 --> 01:17:16,134
you wouldn't had to have made it twice.

1019
01:17:19,382 --> 01:17:21,850
- Laurie?
- What?

1020
01:17:22,618 --> 01:17:24,551
Is the Boogey Man real?

1021
01:17:24,619 --> 01:17:26,917
Why are you so obsessed
with the Boogey Man, Tommy?

1022
01:17:26,988 --> 01:17:30,287
- Well, I hear things at school.
- Like what?

1023
01:17:30,359 --> 01:17:33,088
Well, I heard that on Halloween night,

1024
01:17:33,162 --> 01:17:36,619
the Boogey Man sneaks out
and attacks kids who don't believe.

1025
01:17:38,466 --> 01:17:40,491
You know what, Tommy?

1026
01:17:40,568 --> 01:17:42,535
It is true.

1027
01:17:42,603 --> 01:17:45,265
He likes to eat little boys like you.

1028
01:17:47,342 --> 01:17:48,934
Oh, my God!
The Boogey Man's here!

1029
01:17:49,010 --> 01:17:50,704
We're going to die!

1030
01:17:52,179 --> 01:17:53,737
Hold that thought.

1031
01:17:53,814 --> 01:17:56,009
That's not appropriate
babysitter behavior, Laurie.

1032
01:17:56,083 --> 01:17:57,311
Hello?

1033
01:17:58,018 --> 01:17:59,451
<i>Shut up.</i>

1034
01:17:59,519 --> 01:18:02,352
<i>- My parents will hear about this one.
- Yo, it's me. Hey.</i>

1035
01:18:02,422 --> 01:18:04,720
So the Wallaces are finally out of my face.

1036
01:18:04,791 --> 01:18:06,383
I just talked to Paul.
He's on his way over.

1037
01:18:06,459 --> 01:18:11,954
So I'm finishing making the Queen of Sheba
her popcorn, and then I will be over.

1038
01:18:12,031 --> 01:18:15,158
I have some fun and exciting news for you,
so I'll see you in a few minutes.

1039
01:18:15,233 --> 01:18:16,666
Okay, bye.

1040
01:18:18,404 --> 01:18:20,735
- Guess what, Tommy.
- What?

1041
01:18:20,806 --> 01:18:23,297
Lindsey Wallace is coming over.

1042
01:18:23,375 --> 01:18:25,401
What? She can't come over here!

1043
01:18:25,478 --> 01:18:28,275
- What if the guys see her?
- So?

1044
01:18:28,346 --> 01:18:29,813
One, she's a girl.

1045
01:18:29,881 --> 01:18:32,008
Two, she's not a boy.

1046
01:18:32,083 --> 01:18:33,744
And three, she smells like you.

1047
01:18:33,818 --> 01:18:37,220
This is going to be a long night.

1048
01:18:37,288 --> 01:18:38,619
For the both of us.

1049
01:18:39,624 --> 01:18:40,612
- Don't start with me.
- Uh, uh.

1050
01:18:40,691 --> 01:18:42,716
What's the matter with you?

1051
01:19:09,353 --> 01:19:12,151
Lindsey... get your coat on.

1052
01:19:12,223 --> 01:19:14,156
We're going to go over
and see Tommy Doyal.

1053
01:19:14,224 --> 01:19:15,987
Okay.

1054
01:19:23,466 --> 01:19:26,401
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

1055
01:19:26,469 --> 01:19:28,800
Yeah, exactly.
I said get your coat on.

1056
01:19:28,871 --> 01:19:32,932
We're going over to your late-night lover
Tommy Doyal's house.

1057
01:19:33,008 --> 01:19:34,134
No, you didn't.

1058
01:19:34,209 --> 01:19:35,471
Yes, I did.

1059
01:19:35,544 --> 01:19:37,535
No, you didn't.

1060
01:19:37,613 --> 01:19:42,050
Don, I'm sorry if I don't
sound too concerned,

1061
01:19:42,117 --> 01:19:46,213
but a dead coyote and a missing headstone
doesn't prove anything.

1062
01:19:46,288 --> 01:19:47,312
Well, I think you're wrong, Sheriff.

1063
01:19:47,389 --> 01:19:50,084
I think it does prove
that he's here in Haddonfield.

1064
01:19:50,159 --> 01:19:52,718
It was a Halloween prank.

1065
01:19:52,794 --> 01:19:55,092
Kids pull shit like that all the time.

1066
01:19:55,163 --> 01:19:56,687
The stone will be returned tomorrow.

1067
01:19:56,764 --> 01:19:58,823
And besides, it weighs over half a ton.

1068
01:19:58,900 --> 01:20:01,367
That's my point exactly.

1069
01:20:01,435 --> 01:20:05,370
So you're saying that one man picked it up
and walked away with it?

1070
01:20:05,438 --> 01:20:06,564
Yes.

1071
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:09,336
Doc, I may have been born,
but I wasn't born yesterday.

1072
01:20:09,409 --> 01:20:12,673
I'm sorry, Sheriff,
but please listen to me.

1073
01:20:12,746 --> 01:20:14,976
This may be a matter of life and death.

1074
01:20:15,048 --> 01:20:18,175
All right, I'll tell you what I'll do.

1075
01:20:18,250 --> 01:20:20,048
You come by my office tomorrow--

1076
01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:22,553
Tomorrow is too late.

1077
01:20:22,622 --> 01:20:24,885
Evil is here.

1078
01:20:24,957 --> 01:20:26,788
It's walking amongst us.

1079
01:20:26,859 --> 01:20:29,851
Doc, it sounds to me like
you're talking about the Antichrist.

1080
01:20:29,929 --> 01:20:32,489
Well, perhaps I am.

1081
01:20:32,565 --> 01:20:33,553
Smell my feet

1082
01:20:33,631 --> 01:20:35,293
Give me something good to eat

1083
01:20:35,367 --> 01:20:37,164
If you don't, I don't care

1084
01:20:37,236 --> 01:20:39,169
I'll pull down Annie's underwear

1085
01:20:39,237 --> 01:20:42,366
I can't believe you're making me
haul this thing all the way over there.

1086
01:20:42,441 --> 01:20:45,876
I can't believe you think
I'm not going to tell.

1087
01:20:46,978 --> 01:20:49,811
Gonna share some popcorn
with your little boyfriend?

1088
01:20:49,881 --> 01:20:51,745
No, I'm not.

1089
01:20:51,815 --> 01:20:53,339
You know you are.

1090
01:20:53,417 --> 01:20:56,079
You know you're going
to share something with Paul.

1091
01:20:56,153 --> 01:20:58,348
You know how annoying you are?

1092
01:20:58,422 --> 01:21:00,288
How?

1093
01:21:00,358 --> 01:21:02,417
Trick or treat, smell my feet.

1094
01:21:02,493 --> 01:21:04,222
Give me something good to eat

1095
01:21:04,295 --> 01:21:07,287
- If you don't, I don't care--
- I swear to God, Lindsey.

1096
01:21:07,364 --> 01:21:08,854
If you don't stop singing that song,

1097
01:21:08,932 --> 01:21:10,764
we're going to have
a pumpkin-smashing party

1098
01:21:10,835 --> 01:21:12,563
right here in the middle of the street.

1099
01:21:21,411 --> 01:21:23,641
Tommy, where's your girlfriend Laurie?

1100
01:21:23,714 --> 01:21:26,079
Laurie's not my girlfriend.
I hate girls.

1101
01:21:26,149 --> 01:21:28,343
Why doesn't anyone understand this?

1102
01:21:28,417 --> 01:21:30,009
Good. So does Lindsey.

1103
01:21:30,086 --> 01:21:31,782
Go worship your god.

1104
01:21:31,855 --> 01:21:34,254
- Hey.
- Brought you a present.

1105
01:21:34,323 --> 01:21:35,950
Thanks.

1106
01:21:36,025 --> 01:21:39,119
You, my dear, will be happy to know

1107
01:21:39,195 --> 01:21:42,164
that I talked to Paul
about his buddy Ben Tramer.

1108
01:21:42,231 --> 01:21:44,722
Oh, I thought you said
Ben Tramer was retarded.

1109
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:48,930
<i>Yeah, but he's not
Shortbus retarded or anything.</i>

1110
01:21:49,005 --> 01:21:50,062
What? He's okay.

1111
01:21:50,139 --> 01:21:53,767
- I mean, you need a boyfriend!
- Annie, I don't need a boyfriend.

1112
01:21:53,842 --> 01:21:55,173
- No, that's not what I meant.
- I'm fine.

1113
01:21:55,243 --> 01:21:56,835
- You need--
- Okay, Annie--

1114
01:21:56,911 --> 01:21:58,743
Oh! Oh! Yes!

1115
01:21:58,813 --> 01:21:59,836
Yes, Annie!

1116
01:21:59,914 --> 01:22:02,109
Okay, ok--

1117
01:22:02,182 --> 01:22:03,444
All right, you're right.

1118
01:22:03,517 --> 01:22:04,779
I need a boyfriend.

1119
01:22:04,852 --> 01:22:06,615
So, what did he say?

1120
01:22:06,687 --> 01:22:09,622
He said, and I quote,

1121
01:22:09,690 --> 01:22:13,148
"Dude, she's fucking hot."

1122
01:22:13,227 --> 01:22:15,126
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

1123
01:22:20,067 --> 01:22:22,227
Oh, fuck, that's Paul.
I gotta go.

1124
01:22:22,301 --> 01:22:24,132
- Have fun.
- Thanks, I will.

1125
01:22:24,203 --> 01:22:25,864
- Bye, sexy.
- Bye.

1126
01:22:31,611 --> 01:22:32,873
Hi, baby.

1127
01:22:32,945 --> 01:22:34,503
- What's up?
- How are you?

1128
01:22:34,580 --> 01:22:35,672
I'm good.
How are you?

1129
01:22:35,748 --> 01:22:36,907
Good.

1130
01:22:37,649 --> 01:22:41,608
You have to stop thinking
that we're dealing with a normal man here.

1131
01:22:41,686 --> 01:22:44,951
We're dealing with
a soulless killing machine,

1132
01:22:45,023 --> 01:22:47,651
driven by pure animal instinct.

1133
01:22:48,894 --> 01:22:52,796
Dr. Loomis, I'm going
to have to level with you.

1134
01:22:52,864 --> 01:22:54,728
I read your book.

1135
01:22:54,798 --> 01:22:57,596
I know exactly who you are,
and frankly, I don't like you.

1136
01:22:57,668 --> 01:22:59,499
And I'll tell you something else.

1137
01:22:59,571 --> 01:23:03,233
I think you have created
quite the masterpiece of a monster

1138
01:23:03,307 --> 01:23:08,712
off the blood of this town,
because monsters sell books.

1139
01:23:08,780 --> 01:23:13,182
Please, just look at this photograph
on the cover of the book.

1140
01:23:13,250 --> 01:23:14,342
All right.

1141
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:19,756
I first met Michael 17 years ago.

1142
01:23:19,823 --> 01:23:25,386
When I first met him,
he was a sweet, charming little boy.

1143
01:23:25,462 --> 01:23:29,159
But he had nothing inside.

1144
01:23:29,233 --> 01:23:31,860
There was something missing, a void.

1145
01:23:31,935 --> 01:23:35,496
There was no conscience, no reason,

1146
01:23:35,572 --> 01:23:41,169
even a rudimentary sense
of life or death, right or wrong.

1147
01:23:41,244 --> 01:23:45,010
Yeah. He's come back for her.

1148
01:23:45,081 --> 01:23:49,449
And who is her?

1149
01:23:49,518 --> 01:23:53,079
He's come back for his baby sister.

1150
01:23:53,154 --> 01:23:55,952
I know it in my bones, Sheriff.

1151
01:23:57,526 --> 01:23:58,857
To do what?

1152
01:24:02,430 --> 01:24:04,661
I don't know, Sheriff, but...

1153
01:24:06,034 --> 01:24:08,263
it's not good.

1154
01:24:12,306 --> 01:24:16,208
If I break a promise I made a long time ago,

1155
01:24:16,277 --> 01:24:19,712
then you must promise that you will play it

1156
01:24:19,779 --> 01:24:23,442
razor, and I mean razor, straight with me.

1157
01:24:26,820 --> 01:24:29,448
<i>Hello. You have reached
the Strode residence.</i>

1158
01:24:29,522 --> 01:24:32,285
<i>We can't come to the phone right now.</i>

1159
01:24:32,358 --> 01:24:36,385
<i>So please leave a message and have a...</i>

1160
01:24:36,462 --> 01:24:40,262
<i>Happy Halloweenl</i>

1161
01:24:42,501 --> 01:24:45,231
Yeah, this is Sheriff Brackett. Hello?

1162
01:24:45,304 --> 01:24:46,770
If you can hear me, pick up.

1163
01:24:47,839 --> 01:24:52,606
<i>Please, if you can hear me,
I need to talk to you immediately.</i>

1164
01:24:58,282 --> 01:24:59,271
Let's go.

1165
01:24:59,350 --> 01:25:01,850
- Laurie?
- What, Tommy?

1166
01:25:01,853 --> 01:25:06,312
I would like to return to the subject
we started earlier this evening.

1167
01:25:06,390 --> 01:25:07,914
What? Your hatred of peanut butter?

1168
01:25:08,492 --> 01:25:10,652
No, the Boogey Man.

1169
01:25:10,727 --> 01:25:12,889
I need some closure on this topic.

1170
01:25:12,963 --> 01:25:14,487
I've heard all about this.

1171
01:25:14,564 --> 01:25:16,966
What do you want to know, Tommy?

1172
01:25:17,035 --> 01:25:19,332
Why would he only attack kids
who don't believe?

1173
01:25:19,403 --> 01:25:21,530
I mean, it doesn't make sense.

1174
01:25:21,605 --> 01:25:24,199
Is it because if you believe,
then you're protected by his powers?

1175
01:25:24,275 --> 01:25:26,209
Okay, Tommy,
enough about the Boogey Man.

1176
01:25:26,276 --> 01:25:27,335
It's nonsense.

1177
01:25:27,411 --> 01:25:30,141
I'm with Tommy on this one.

1178
01:25:30,213 --> 01:25:34,206
Yeah. Why do you keep
avoiding the subject, Laurie?

1179
01:25:34,284 --> 01:25:36,081
Is-- Is she scared?

1180
01:25:36,152 --> 01:25:37,380
- Maybe she is.
- Ooh, yeah.

1181
01:25:37,453 --> 01:25:39,614
- Maybe you're scared!
- Are you scared?

1182
01:25:39,689 --> 01:25:41,384
Okay, stop! Stop!

1183
01:25:41,457 --> 01:25:44,983
Leave me alone for five seconds, please.

1184
01:25:45,060 --> 01:25:47,858
- Five, four, three...
- You guys...

1185
01:25:47,930 --> 01:25:50,057
- Okay, please don't.
- Two, one.

1186
01:25:50,132 --> 01:25:51,656
No! No!

1187
01:25:51,733 --> 01:25:53,360
I'm going to tell your parents!

1188
01:25:57,072 --> 01:26:00,064
Hey, don't pull it like that.
You're going to stretch it all out.

1189
01:26:00,142 --> 01:26:04,134
- Come on, munchie.
- Stop. This is expensive, idiot.

1190
01:26:13,588 --> 01:26:15,453
- You want to fuck me?
- Yeah.

1191
01:26:15,523 --> 01:26:17,251
- Yeah?
- You're so fucking hot, babe.

1192
01:26:17,324 --> 01:26:20,191
You want to fuck me?
I want to hear you say it.

1193
01:26:20,260 --> 01:26:21,750
- I'm gonna fuck you.
- Yeah?

1194
01:26:21,828 --> 01:26:23,227
Say it again.

1195
01:26:27,767 --> 01:26:29,962
It's so fucking warm.

1196
01:26:56,461 --> 01:26:58,053
Oh, my--

1197
01:26:58,129 --> 01:26:59,221
What's the matter?

1198
01:28:20,275 --> 01:28:22,037
Lindsey, it's time for you to go home.

1199
01:28:22,109 --> 01:28:23,667
But the movie's not over.

1200
01:28:23,744 --> 01:28:25,371
You can finish watching the movie
at your house.

1201
01:28:25,446 --> 01:28:28,437
- How about during the commercial break?
- Negative.

1202
01:28:28,516 --> 01:28:29,812
Go get your jacket!

1203
01:28:29,883 --> 01:28:33,149
You heard her, girl.
Keep on marching.

1204
01:28:33,221 --> 01:28:35,518
Ugh! I am Queen Sheba, okay?

1205
01:28:35,590 --> 01:28:39,491
- Bow down and worship me.
- Go get your jacket.

1206
01:28:41,495 --> 01:28:43,224
Are you sure you're okay
while I take Lindsey home?

1207
01:28:43,296 --> 01:28:45,787
- I'm fine.
- Are you sure, little Tommy?

1208
01:28:45,866 --> 01:28:49,357
- You'll be by yourself!
- I'm fine, now stop asking!

1209
01:28:49,435 --> 01:28:50,425
- Are you sure?
- Yes!

1210
01:28:50,504 --> 01:28:52,802
- He's scared.
- No, I'm not.

1211
01:28:52,873 --> 01:28:54,238
- Yes, you are.
- Shut up.

1212
01:28:54,307 --> 01:28:57,104
Okay, you guys. Stop.

1213
01:28:57,176 --> 01:29:00,077
Behave, Tommy-Wommy.

1214
01:29:02,481 --> 01:29:06,645
About 17 years ago,
I respond to a 911

1215
01:29:06,719 --> 01:29:09,711
which turned out to be
the Myers woman's suicide.

1216
01:29:09,788 --> 01:29:14,884
And I see this beautiful,
innocent baby sitting in this bloody mess,

1217
01:29:14,959 --> 01:29:18,122
and I can't imagine this child growing up
with a stigma around her neck,

1218
01:29:18,696 --> 01:29:24,497
so I omit her from the report,
I drive her to another town,

1219
01:29:24,568 --> 01:29:26,833
and drop her off
at the nearest emergency room.

1220
01:29:26,905 --> 01:29:28,735
And I think that this
is going to be the end of it.

1221
01:29:28,805 --> 01:29:31,673
About three months later,
I find out from a friend of mine,

1222
01:29:31,743 --> 01:29:34,803
Mason Strode,
that he's adopted the baby.

1223
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:36,141
Oh, my God.

1224
01:29:44,621 --> 01:29:46,351
- Cold?
- Yeah.

1225
01:29:46,424 --> 01:29:47,914
Okay, come here.

1226
01:29:50,093 --> 01:29:52,220
- Did you have fun?
- Yeah.

1227
01:29:52,296 --> 01:29:54,127
You sure?

1228
01:29:54,197 --> 01:29:55,425
Yeah.

1229
01:29:58,168 --> 01:30:00,329
Annie? We're coming in.

1230
01:30:00,404 --> 01:30:02,133
You better be decent.

1231
01:30:04,708 --> 01:30:06,641
- Where are the lights?
- Here.

1232
01:30:09,712 --> 01:30:10,701
Annie!

1233
01:30:12,914 --> 01:30:14,142
Oh, my God!

1234
01:30:14,550 --> 01:30:15,641
Lindsey, run home!

1235
01:30:15,717 --> 01:30:17,618
Go call the police! Go!

1236
01:30:17,687 --> 01:30:20,951
Help! Help! Help!

1237
01:30:21,022 --> 01:30:23,923
Oh, my God, honey!
Are you okay?

1238
01:30:23,992 --> 01:30:26,654
Oh, baby, what happened?

1239
01:30:28,330 --> 01:30:29,957
- He's in--
- I'm going to call the police.

1240
01:30:30,031 --> 01:30:31,828
Okay? I promise.

1241
01:30:46,647 --> 01:30:47,944
Shit!

1242
01:30:51,452 --> 01:30:55,012
<i>- 911.
- I need an ambulance, please!</i>

1243
01:30:55,088 --> 01:30:57,556
My friend's bleeding to death.

1244
01:31:23,481 --> 01:31:25,006
Laurie!

1245
01:31:25,083 --> 01:31:27,778
Laurie!

1246
01:31:27,853 --> 01:31:29,684
Laurie!

1247
01:31:29,754 --> 01:31:34,418
My name is Laurie Strode,
and I'm at 1987 Winchester Drive.

1248
01:31:34,492 --> 01:31:37,518
<i>We have a 911 call,
1987 Winchester Drive.</i>

1249
01:31:40,331 --> 01:31:41,390
This is Brackett.

1250
01:31:41,465 --> 01:31:44,127
What's the nature of the emergency
and who called it in?

1251
01:31:44,201 --> 01:31:47,227
<i>Two-stabbing-victim call
placed by a Laurie Strode.</i>

1252
01:31:47,304 --> 01:31:49,932
He's found her!
He's found her, for God's sake!

1253
01:31:50,007 --> 01:31:52,908
- How long's it going to take to get there?
- It's about ten minutes.

1254
01:31:54,278 --> 01:31:56,212
Laurie!

1255
01:31:56,280 --> 01:31:57,713
Please, you've got to help her.

1256
01:31:57,782 --> 01:31:59,806
Laurie!

1257
01:31:59,883 --> 01:32:03,581
Baby! Baby, hold on, okay?
Annie, they're com--

1258
01:32:29,011 --> 01:32:31,639
Help!

1259
01:32:31,714 --> 01:32:33,477
Help! Please!

1260
01:32:37,719 --> 01:32:40,153

1261
01:32:40,221 --> 01:32:42,314
Help! Please!

1262
01:32:42,390 --> 01:32:45,188
Help, please! Someone!

1263
01:32:51,432 --> 01:32:53,661
Tommy!

1264
01:32:54,735 --> 01:32:57,260
Tommy, open the door!

1265
01:32:57,337 --> 01:33:01,296
Open the door!
Tommy, open the door!

1266
01:33:01,475 --> 01:33:04,808

Open the door!

1267
01:33:04,878 --> 01:33:09,645
Open the door! Tommy!
Open the door!

1268
01:33:09,716 --> 01:33:11,274
What's going on?

1269
01:33:11,351 --> 01:33:12,443
What's happening?

1270
01:33:12,519 --> 01:33:13,678
Where's Lindsey, Tommy?

1271
01:33:13,754 --> 01:33:14,811
- Where's Lindsey?
- She's right there!

1272
01:33:14,887 --> 01:33:16,912
- She's upstairs!
- I'm right here.

1273
01:33:21,393 --> 01:33:23,292
Go upstairs!

1274
01:33:23,361 --> 01:33:25,660
Tommy, go upstairs!

1275
01:33:33,438 --> 01:33:35,668
Guys, get in the bathroom!

1276
01:33:36,908 --> 01:33:38,773
- He's coming!
- Stop! Shh!

1277
01:33:38,842 --> 01:33:41,243
Tommy, be quiet, please?

1278
01:33:54,591 --> 01:33:56,389
I got this.
You check upstairs.

1279
01:33:56,461 --> 01:33:57,826
Right.

1280
01:34:15,444 --> 01:34:17,811
This is the police.
Are you all right?

1281
01:34:17,881 --> 01:34:20,815
He's out there! Please help us!

1282
01:34:20,883 --> 01:34:22,009
The door's locked.

1283
01:34:22,084 --> 01:34:23,711
Are you able to unlock the door?

1284
01:34:31,794 --> 01:34:33,386
Are you able to open the door?

1285
01:34:34,597 --> 01:34:35,894
Yeah.

1286
01:34:37,899 --> 01:34:39,696
Laurie, no.

1287
01:34:39,768 --> 01:34:41,099
Is he gone?

1288
01:34:41,169 --> 01:34:42,761
No, there's no one out here.

1289
01:34:48,209 --> 01:34:50,201
Please, just unlock the door.

1290
01:34:50,278 --> 01:34:51,609
Yeah, hold on.

1291
01:34:51,680 --> 01:34:55,741
- No!
- Open the door.

1292
01:35:02,322 --> 01:35:03,483
Oh, God!

1293
01:35:14,701 --> 01:35:15,793
Freeze!

1294
01:35:20,006 --> 01:35:21,633
Aah!

1295
01:36:29,539 --> 01:36:31,165
Stay behind me.

1296
01:36:45,988 --> 01:36:47,853
Annie?

1297
01:36:47,923 --> 01:36:49,355
Sweetie?

1298
01:36:50,159 --> 01:36:51,955
Annie.

1299
01:36:52,026 --> 01:36:54,052
Annie. Oh, sweetie.

1300
01:36:54,129 --> 01:36:57,030
Stay with me.
Stay with me.

1301
01:36:57,099 --> 01:36:59,157
They'll be here soon.
Come on, darling.

1302
01:37:00,435 --> 01:37:01,424
Jesus.

1303
01:37:01,502 --> 01:37:03,367
Over here!

1304
01:37:04,605 --> 01:37:05,594
Inside here!

1305
01:37:05,673 --> 01:37:07,368
- Boogey Man!
- Help!

1306
01:37:10,210 --> 01:37:11,269
Guys, over here!

1307
01:37:11,346 --> 01:37:12,937
- The Boogey Man!
- What is it?

1308
01:37:13,013 --> 01:37:14,776
Help! The Boogey Man!

1309
01:37:14,848 --> 01:37:15,837
- What? What?
- He's over there!

1310
01:37:15,916 --> 01:37:18,476
He took Laurie.
He took Laurie away.

1311
01:37:18,552 --> 01:37:19,644
Okay, guys.

1312
01:37:19,720 --> 01:37:22,153
Go over and stand by that ambulance
and just wait there.

1313
01:37:22,222 --> 01:37:23,689
Don't move!

1314
01:37:52,984 --> 01:37:55,316

1315
01:37:57,956 --> 01:37:59,752
Lynda?

1316
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:08,831
Lynda, wake up!

1317
01:38:08,900 --> 01:38:11,130

1324
01:38:43,599 --> 01:38:44,793
What do you want?

1325
01:38:49,839 --> 01:38:52,363
No, no, please.

Please don't hurt us, please!

1327
01:38:55,310 --> 01:38:58,108
No, please don't hurt me, please!

1328
01:39:28,942 --> 01:39:30,307
I don't understand.

1329
01:39:30,376 --> 01:39:34,710
Please, just let--
Please leave me alone!

1330
01:39:34,781 --> 01:39:37,841

01:40:23,361 --> 01:40:26,125

1359
01:43:46,186 --> 01:43:49,019

Please.

1366
01:44:17,148 --> 01:44:18,912
Help me, please.

1367
01:44:23,055 --> 01:44:25,488
It's all right. It's all right.

1368
01:44:25,556 --> 01:44:29,118
You're safe now. It's okay.

Ow, my leg.

1370
01:44:31,964 --> 01:44:33,556
It's okay.

1371
01:44:33,632 --> 01:44:35,064
It's all right.

1372
01:45:46,934 --> 01:45:50,301
Was that the Boogey Man?

1373
01:45:52,639 --> 01:45:57,576
As a matter of fact, I do believe it was.

1374

1375

Michael, don't!

Michael, stop!

1377

For God's sake, listen to me!

1378
01:46:18,965 --> 01:46:22,195
Look... it's not her fault.

1379
01:46:24,803 --> 01:46:26,361
Michael, it's my fault.

1380
01:46:26,438 --> 01:46:28,804
I failed you.

1381
01:46:28,874 --> 01:46:31,570
Please, let her go. Please.

1382
01:47:01,371 --> 01:47:02,531
