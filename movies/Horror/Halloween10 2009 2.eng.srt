<i>Do you like your present?</i>

3
00:00:38,137 --> 00:00:39,125
<i>Yeah.</i>

4
00:00:39,771 --> 00:00:40,966
What's wrong, Michael?

5
00:00:41,707 --> 00:00:44,231
It reminds me of something.

6
00:00:44,777 --> 00:00:46,642
What? What does it remind you of?

7
00:00:46,845 --> 00:00:49,314
Just a dream
that I had last night.

8
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:54,182
What kind of dream? Was it a
good dream or was it a bad dream?

9
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:56,651
It was a good dream.
A really good dream.

10
00:00:56,856 --> 00:00:59,518
You were dressed in all white,
like a ghost.

11
00:00:59,725 --> 00:01:02,591
Like a really beautiful ghost.

12
00:01:02,795 --> 00:01:06,959
You were walking down this white
hallway with this big white horse

13
00:01:07,165 --> 00:01:10,067
saying you were gonna come
and take me back home.

14
00:01:10,536 --> 00:01:13,004
Hmm.. I wish I could take you
home, honey. I miss you there.

15
00:01:13,204 --> 00:01:15,298
- I miss you too.
- Aw.

16
00:01:16,575 --> 00:01:19,340
Whenever you look at the horse,
you can think of Mommy, okay?

17
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:21,778
- Okay.
- Okay.

18
00:01:23,382 --> 00:01:25,713
- Are you ticklish?
- No.

19
00:01:25,918 --> 00:01:28,853
- I forgot. I thought you were.
- No, I'm not.

20
00:01:29,754 --> 00:01:32,222
Yes, you are. That's
the face I wanna see.

21
00:01:32,424 --> 00:01:34,222
Okay? Cheer up.
Okay.

22
00:01:34,426 --> 00:01:36,292
- All right.
- Okay. No more gloom.

23
00:01:36,495 --> 00:01:38,656
- Okay.
- Okay.

24
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:40,287
Laurie?

25
00:02:40,492 --> 00:02:42,085
Laurie, is that you?

26
00:02:42,293 --> 00:02:44,853
Laurie? Laurie?

27
00:02:45,063 --> 00:02:47,361
Stop, stop. Stop, stop, sweetie. Stop.

28
00:02:47,566 --> 00:02:50,091
Stop.
It's Sheriff Brackett.

29
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:54,965
Laurie, give me the gun.

30
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:57,539
That's it.
Just give me the gun.

31
00:02:57,742 --> 00:02:59,335
That's it. Easy.

32
00:02:59,545 --> 00:03:01,808
Easy, sweetie. Easy.

33
00:03:02,014 --> 00:03:03,811
I killed him.

34
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:07,746
The man.

35
00:03:09,254 --> 00:03:12,656
I climbed in the wall, I fell.

36
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:14,649
Okay. All right, sweetie.

37
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,919
- Sweetie. It's okay.
- I killed him.

38
00:03:17,128 --> 00:03:18,460
- I killed him.
- It's okay.

39
00:03:18,663 --> 00:03:20,324
It's all right. It's all
right. It's all right.

40
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:23,127
I want you to come with me,
okay?

41
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:26,259
Please!

42
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:35,875
What is happening?
Where am I? Where am I?

43
00:03:40,953 --> 00:03:45,480
We're gonna need Neuro,
Ortho, Trauma, X-ray!

44
00:03:45,691 --> 00:03:46,987
Am I...? Am I gonna die?

45
00:03:47,259 --> 00:03:49,192
Am I gonna die?!

46
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:50,918
Am I...? Am I gonna die?

47
00:03:51,129 --> 00:03:53,689
Heads up,
everybody. Clear. Make a path.

48
00:03:54,265 --> 00:03:56,927
We're losing
him. Altered mental status,

49
00:03:57,135 --> 00:03:59,661
unknown injury.
BP is 79 over 40.

50
00:04:05,544 --> 00:04:08,138
On my count we're
gonna move her. Ready?

51
00:04:08,347 --> 00:04:11,145
And one, two, three.

52
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:15,277
We need CBC chem panel.

53
00:04:15,487 --> 00:04:16,920
Hucks.

54
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:20,218
How many?

55
00:04:20,559 --> 00:04:21,582
Two.

56
00:04:22,127 --> 00:04:23,788
They heavy?

57
00:04:28,567 --> 00:04:31,228
What the hell
happened to this kid anyway?

58
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:36,875
I don't know. I thought it
was a car accident. I'm very confused.

59
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:38,805
At least
Neurosurgery cleared her head.

60
00:04:39,011 --> 00:04:40,478
We don't have to do anything
with that.

61
00:04:40,678 --> 00:04:42,077
Right.

62
00:04:45,216 --> 00:04:48,550
She's gonna need Plastic, but that's
the least of her worries right now.

63
00:04:55,661 --> 00:04:57,218
- Come on.
- Pull me down the stairs.

64
00:04:57,428 --> 00:05:00,125
- Lift it up your ass.
- Come on, pull it up.

65
00:05:26,692 --> 00:05:28,216
Cut.

66
00:05:29,127 --> 00:05:32,790
On three. Nice
and easy. One, two, three!

67
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,090
Let's go feet first.

68
00:05:37,302 --> 00:05:38,826
Feels like he's made of lead.

69
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:42,404
Wait, wait, wait. Pick him up.

70
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:43,870
Oh, Jesus Christ.

71
00:05:44,643 --> 00:05:46,406
He weighs a ton.

72
00:05:47,478 --> 00:05:49,105
Looks good.

73
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:52,577
It'll hold. At least for now.

74
00:05:54,386 --> 00:05:56,081
Strap him down tight.

75
00:05:56,288 --> 00:05:58,848
I don't need that behemoth
banging around back there.

76
00:05:59,057 --> 00:06:02,494
Yeah, yeah, yeah. This ain't
my first fucking corpse, rodeo.

77
00:06:02,694 --> 00:06:05,095
Just close it
up when you're done.

78
00:06:05,297 --> 00:06:07,197
When the boys get him
over to county,

79
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:09,560
just make sure that
they lock the place up tight.

80
00:06:09,768 --> 00:06:12,430
I don't want any surprises
till I get there in the morning.

81
00:06:12,637 --> 00:06:15,129
No problem. On first sight,

82
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:17,673
I'd say cause of death
is fairly obvious.

83
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:21,903
I'd say that there's nothing obvious
about anything that happened here tonight.

84
00:06:22,113 --> 00:06:23,978
Not a goddamn thing.

85
00:06:32,557 --> 00:06:34,651
The son of a bitch
was heavy, huh?

86
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,384
Six guys to lift one stiff.

87
00:06:37,596 --> 00:06:38,893
That's one for the books.

88
00:06:39,163 --> 00:06:42,031
Technically,
five guys and a girl.

89
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,067
Whatever.

90
00:06:46,004 --> 00:06:47,768
Did you get a look
at the naked chick?

91
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,230
Ooh.

92
00:06:50,442 --> 00:06:54,173
Man, she was F-I-N-E, fine.

93
00:06:57,316 --> 00:07:00,012
Yeah. She still looked fresh.

94
00:07:02,887 --> 00:07:05,482
I heard a story about
a couple of meat wagon boys

95
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,817
fucking corpses over in Essex.

96
00:07:09,661 --> 00:07:12,129
I ain't never had the urge
till tonight.

97
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:14,595
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey, whoa!
Whoa. Come on!

98
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,495
Brackett even thinks he hears
you joking about that

99
00:07:17,702 --> 00:07:20,899
and you're out of here on your ass.
- I wouldn't ever do it.

100
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:23,673
- Oh, yeah?
- I'm just saying.

101
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:26,810
She still looked good to me.
Nice little titties hanging out.

102
00:07:27,012 --> 00:07:30,345
- Come on, that's disgusting. Stop it.
- I got wood just Ziploc'ing her up.

103
00:07:30,548 --> 00:07:33,540
Stop. Shut up. Please.

104
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:35,880
I'm just saying, man.

105
00:07:40,558 --> 00:07:41,855
- Hey.
- Huh?

106
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,625
What's the difference
between jam and jelly?

107
00:07:45,831 --> 00:07:47,196
I don't know. What?

108
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:50,129
You can't jelly your cock
up a dead girl's ass.

109
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:52,735
- Ha, ha, ha.
- Ha, ha. I knew that one.

110
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:54,437
Cow! Cow!

111
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,386
Shit. Oh, shit.

112
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:47,490
Oh, fuck. Hooks. Hooks.

113
00:08:47,692 --> 00:08:50,525
Hooks. Hooks.

114
00:08:56,634 --> 00:08:58,796
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

115
00:08:59,004 --> 00:09:01,370
Fuck! Fuck. Fuck.

116
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,532
Oh, God.

117
00:09:14,318 --> 00:09:17,082
Fuck. Fuck.

118
00:09:19,691 --> 00:09:20,749
Fuck!

119
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:22,153
Oh, fuck!

120
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:28,232
Help me! Help me!

121
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:32,427
Aah!

122
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:37,769
Hooks.

123
00:09:37,975 --> 00:09:42,275
Hooks, Hooks, Hooks.
Hooks, Hooks.

124
00:09:45,817 --> 00:09:47,751
Help me. Help please.

125
00:09:53,158 --> 00:09:55,091
Help me.

126
00:09:57,229 --> 00:09:58,423
Help. Help.

127
00:10:00,231 --> 00:10:03,201
Please, help. Help me!

128
00:10:04,836 --> 00:10:07,100
Help me. Hey.

129
00:12:13,932 --> 00:12:17,629
So I told her. I said, "Girl, if you
think I'm letting you handle Thanksgiving,

130
00:12:17,836 --> 00:12:19,996
then I'm ordering Chinese."
- Ha, ha, ha.

131
00:12:20,205 --> 00:12:22,969
Octavia, it's a pleasure that
you're embracing life this way.

132
00:12:23,174 --> 00:12:24,369
I love seeing you.

133
00:12:24,576 --> 00:12:26,134
She's bringing Miriam down.

134
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:28,312
- Not the dog!
- That yapping dog that peed

135
00:12:28,513 --> 00:12:30,275
- all over my new couch.
- Ha, ha, ha.

136
00:12:30,481 --> 00:12:33,110
You are gonna have to
cook that dog for Thanksgiving.

137
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,515
Honey, I'm gonna leave.

138
00:12:37,054 --> 00:12:38,783
- Hold down the fort.
- All right, doc.

139
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,924
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Good night.

140
00:12:50,134 --> 00:12:51,192
Annie?

141
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,332
Oh, Annie.

142
00:12:58,909 --> 00:13:00,934
Oh, baby.

143
00:13:05,984 --> 00:13:08,076
Oh, Annie.

144
00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:14,984
Oh, Annie. Please don't die.
Please, please, please don't die.

145
00:13:15,192 --> 00:13:17,286
Please, Miss Strode.

146
00:13:17,495 --> 00:13:19,123
You cannot be in here.

147
00:13:19,364 --> 00:13:22,389
I just wanted to sit here with her.
Please, I won't bother her.

148
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,296
Mm-mm. You need to go
back to your own room.

149
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:26,061
You need to rest
just as much as she does.

150
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,966
Please. Please Just a few minutes.
Just a few minutes. Please.

151
00:13:29,173 --> 00:13:31,403
Come on.
Let's get you back into bed.

152
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:35,635
You're doing good, sweetie.
Doing good. All right.

153
00:13:36,914 --> 00:13:39,884
<i>Nurse Daniels,
please report to Emergency Room A.</i>

154
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:42,349
Oh. Honey, do you need my
help getting back to your room?

155
00:13:42,553 --> 00:13:43,543
I'm fine.

156
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:50,222
<i>Nurse Daniels, please
report to Emergency Room A.</i>

157
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,099
Nurse, I...

158
00:14:03,107 --> 00:14:05,905
I need something for my head.

159
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:08,802
Hello?

160
00:14:10,481 --> 00:14:12,916
I'm getting really dizzy.

161
00:14:34,472 --> 00:14:36,373
Nurse, I need something
for my head.

162
00:16:59,951 --> 00:17:01,748
Help!

163
00:17:08,058 --> 00:17:09,753
Help!

164
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:23,403
Help! Somebody! Please!

165
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:56,199
Help! Help!

166
00:18:56,401 --> 00:19:00,097
Help, somebody!

167
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,239
Help, somebody!

168
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,634
Please!

169
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:12,848
Help!

170
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,053
Somebody, please.

171
00:19:17,454 --> 00:19:19,319
Help me!

172
00:19:36,374 --> 00:19:37,965
Help!

173
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:41,210
Help me!

174
00:20:31,996 --> 00:20:34,259
Oh, goddamn it.

175
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,427
This is just fucking great.

176
00:20:55,286 --> 00:20:57,516
- Help me, please! Help me!
- Oh, my God!

177
00:20:57,721 --> 00:20:59,586
- What the Christ are you doing here?
- Please help. Help me, please.

178
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:01,655
You're gonna freeze
your ass off out here.

179
00:21:01,859 --> 00:21:03,623
Please! Please! Please!
Here, easy.

180
00:21:03,827 --> 00:21:05,886
- Look, just sit down. Here, here.
- Please!

181
00:21:06,096 --> 00:21:10,760
Here, now. Put this on before they
blame me for you catching pneumonia.

182
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:12,799
The nurse is dead.
The nurse is...

183
00:21:13,003 --> 00:21:16,029
No, no, it's going to be okay.
Listen, it's going to be all right.

184
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,231
I work here.
My name is Buddy.

185
00:21:18,442 --> 00:21:20,433
- Okay, it's going to be fine.
- No. No, it's not.

186
00:21:20,644 --> 00:21:22,134
- I've gotta get you back.
- No, it's... No, it's...

187
00:21:22,346 --> 00:21:25,680
- Just let me go get my car, okay?
- Please! Please!

188
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:27,442
- It'll just take a second.
- No, no!

189
00:21:27,652 --> 00:21:30,086
No, honey,
it'll just take a second.

190
00:21:30,288 --> 00:21:32,653
- Please don't leave me. Please.
- The car is right out there.

191
00:21:32,856 --> 00:21:34,586
Look, look, here.
Here, here.

192
00:21:34,792 --> 00:21:38,229
Just drink what's left of this
till I get back, okay?

193
00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:41,227
Okay? And I promise,
I'll be back in just a second.

194
00:21:41,432 --> 00:21:43,093
- No, please.
- Okay, just don't...

195
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,393
Nobody's gonna hurt you, honey.

196
00:21:44,602 --> 00:21:50,164
It'll be all right. Here, I'm gonna..
I'm gonna lock this door, okay?

197
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:51,364
One second,

198
00:21:52,242 --> 00:21:55,371
and then I will pull up
right here, okay?

199
00:21:55,579 --> 00:21:57,308
All right.

200
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:04,984
Buddy!

201
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:08,685
Buddy, please.

202
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:12,290
Buddy, please come back!

203
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:19,730
Buddy!

204
00:22:41,792 --> 00:22:43,351
Buddy!

205
00:22:48,232 --> 00:22:49,564
I'm sorry.

206
00:22:49,767 --> 00:22:53,099
This old car doesn't always
like to start,

207
00:22:53,304 --> 00:22:55,032
especially in the rain.

208
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,767
Everything will be fine, okay?

209
00:23:00,577 --> 00:23:02,603
No! Buddy!

210
00:24:19,656 --> 00:24:22,625
Somebody! Somebody, please!

211
00:24:42,145 --> 00:24:44,943
Help me! Help me, please!

212
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:50,420
No!

213
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:17,971
Come on.

214
00:25:20,351 --> 00:25:22,375
He's dead.

215
00:25:23,186 --> 00:25:24,381
He's fucking dead.

216
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:28,718
Oh, fuck.

217
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:35,855
Oh, God.

218
00:25:53,483 --> 00:25:55,247
I am running ragged this morning.

219
00:25:55,452 --> 00:25:56,613
Good Morning.
- Running ragged.

220
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,878
Good morning.

221
00:25:58,088 --> 00:26:00,955
- Did you hear Laurie last night?
- Yes, Dad.

222
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:05,255
I hear her every night. Please,
God, don't say anything to her.

223
00:26:05,462 --> 00:26:07,396
I won't. I won't.

224
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:08,621
Want some egg whites?

225
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:12,859
No. I think I'm gonna get me one
of them sticky buns on the way in.

226
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:15,631
That's great.
Pastry for breakfast.

227
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:18,707
Seriously, 500 calories
of sugar and shit.

228
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,740
I know it, I know it.

229
00:26:21,445 --> 00:26:22,434
- Morning.
- Morning.

230
00:26:22,646 --> 00:26:23,909
Good morning, sunshine.

231
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:26,742
I got to go.
Hey, slow your roll for one second.

232
00:26:26,951 --> 00:26:29,419
Please do not forget
to pick up the pizza.

233
00:26:29,619 --> 00:26:30,746
And whole-wheat crust.

234
00:26:31,556 --> 00:26:32,579
God, Annie.

235
00:26:32,789 --> 00:26:36,452
Why don't we just have them take
the cheese and put it on cardboard?

236
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:38,992
- Aren't you late?
- Cardboard's got a lot of fiber.

237
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:41,221
- And it's cheap.
- No meat.

238
00:26:45,936 --> 00:26:47,733
Rough night?

239
00:26:48,338 --> 00:26:49,431
Did you hear me?

240
00:26:49,807 --> 00:26:52,173
Mm. Just a little.

241
00:26:52,375 --> 00:26:56,971
God. Just when I think I can get back to
something as simple as sleep, it's like...

242
00:26:58,482 --> 00:27:00,712
Right back at me.

243
00:27:01,551 --> 00:27:02,951
Do you wanna tell me about it?

244
00:27:03,554 --> 00:27:05,214
Nah.

245
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:07,856
I don't remember much.

246
00:27:08,058 --> 00:27:09,184
It was a hospital one.

247
00:27:10,661 --> 00:27:13,653
I haven't had one of those
in a while.

248
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:17,858
Guess I know what I'll be
yakking about in therapy today.

249
00:27:18,368 --> 00:27:20,303
One day at a time, babe.

250
00:27:21,939 --> 00:27:23,838
One day at a time.

251
00:27:24,075 --> 00:27:26,599
One fucking day at a time.

252
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:30,144
You know what, if I hear that fucking
phrase one more fucking time...

253
00:27:30,347 --> 00:27:33,646
She just fucking sits there in her
fucking leather chair and judges me...

254
00:27:33,851 --> 00:27:37,684
- like she's fucking God.
- It's her job, Laurie. My God.

255
00:27:37,888 --> 00:27:41,915
What am I supposed to say?
Boo-fucking-hoo for you.

256
00:27:42,125 --> 00:27:44,616
See? You don't fucking care.

257
00:27:45,028 --> 00:27:49,897
Right, I don't fucking care.
I don't understand, Laurie.

258
00:27:51,335 --> 00:27:55,896
Oh, nice. Thanks for
leaving me some coffee, Dad.

259
00:28:05,215 --> 00:28:09,710
I don't know, I just... I wake up
and I feel like I can't even breathe.

260
00:28:09,921 --> 00:28:11,387
Mm-hm.

261
00:28:11,588 --> 00:28:13,250
They seem to be
getting worse.

262
00:28:17,161 --> 00:28:20,028
I'm... I'm concerned,

263
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:24,565
but, gosh, I can't say
that I'm surprised.

264
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:28,364
I mean, it's Halloween, and Halloween
is a big trigger point for you, isn't it?

265
00:28:31,107 --> 00:28:32,734
Barbara,

266
00:28:32,943 --> 00:28:35,173
I know Michael Myers is dead.

267
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:37,569
I shot him in the fucking head.

268
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:41,412
I know he's not gonna come back
just because of some stupid holiday.

269
00:28:41,618 --> 00:28:44,986
- Laurie, they never found his body.
- So?

270
00:28:45,189 --> 00:28:49,182
So it's very hard for you
to get closure on this.

271
00:28:49,859 --> 00:28:52,828
I mean, he's objectively dead
but he's living in your mind,

272
00:28:53,029 --> 00:28:55,657
and he's living in your
heart and your emotions.

273
00:28:55,865 --> 00:28:59,063
So that's the reality that
we have to heal you from.

274
00:28:59,369 --> 00:29:02,770
Which is why I say you're still
in recovery.

275
00:29:03,641 --> 00:29:07,576
So, basically, I just have to wait
until my brain heals?

276
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,508
Well, let's try and help your brain
heal a little bit today, okay?

277
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:16,949
- Okay.
- Okay.

278
00:29:17,622 --> 00:29:19,885
How's your relationship
with Annie going?

279
00:29:21,125 --> 00:29:23,355
- Annie?
- Yeah.

280
00:29:28,465 --> 00:29:29,797
Not good.

281
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:31,598
Hm.

282
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:35,930
I don't know, I feel kind of
shitty by saying this, but...

283
00:29:37,141 --> 00:29:39,734
She's a constant reminder.

284
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:45,471
Every time I see her face,
and I see those scars,

285
00:29:45,682 --> 00:29:47,913
I know that it's my fault.

286
00:29:48,118 --> 00:29:52,180
And I get angry. And there's
something in my body that snaps.

287
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:56,326
And I get this zero to a hundred rage,
and I just wanna go up to her,

288
00:29:56,527 --> 00:30:00,486
- and I just wanna... Fuck, I don't know.
- Finish the thought.

289
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:05,657
- Finish that thought. It's important.
- I'd rather not. You'll send me away.

290
00:30:06,569 --> 00:30:10,700
I would never send you away. We're
here to keep you out of the hospital.

291
00:30:10,907 --> 00:30:14,138
The last place you're gonna
heal is in a hospital.

292
00:30:20,284 --> 00:30:22,115
What is that?

293
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:26,387
That? That's whatever you
think it is is what that is.

294
00:30:26,824 --> 00:30:31,317
The theory is that this ambiguous
stimuli here will bring

295
00:30:31,528 --> 00:30:35,464
your subconscious thoughts
into the light. Illuminate them.

296
00:30:35,932 --> 00:30:37,298
So, what do you see?

297
00:30:41,672 --> 00:30:43,502
White horse.

298
00:30:45,576 --> 00:30:48,942
So, what does that tell you?
Am I crazy or sane?

299
00:30:49,512 --> 00:30:51,742
It tells me you're a girl
who likes white horses.

300
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,490
The natives are getting restless.

301
00:31:12,702 --> 00:31:14,567
You were supposed to
be here 45 minutes ago.

302
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,702
Hello. Yes, hello, darling.

303
00:31:17,907 --> 00:31:21,434
No. How are you? Hello? Hello?

304
00:31:22,346 --> 00:31:24,678
Damn. Hello? Argh.

305
00:31:25,048 --> 00:31:28,678
Everybody has been completely
briefed on why we are here.

306
00:31:28,885 --> 00:31:31,752
They know the drill so I don't foresee
any problems in that department.

307
00:31:31,955 --> 00:31:34,288
Everything is kosher,
as my people say.

308
00:31:34,491 --> 00:31:37,086
I know every one of these
journalists personally, they're cool.

309
00:31:37,294 --> 00:31:39,728
Trust me, they are cool.

310
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:43,126
So I feel like this should be
really a positive experience,

311
00:31:43,334 --> 00:31:44,732
you know, and be really
good for the book.

312
00:31:44,934 --> 00:31:48,802
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hi. Did you just mention
"journalists," "cool" and "positive"

313
00:31:49,006 --> 00:31:51,236
all in the same sentence
without throwing up?

314
00:31:51,442 --> 00:31:52,739
Yes, why?
Is that a problem?

315
00:31:52,942 --> 00:31:55,969
It's just quite an oxymoron,
my dear.

316
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,010
Look, can you just
level with me?

317
00:31:58,214 --> 00:32:01,012
Is there going to be
a problem today?

318
00:32:01,218 --> 00:32:03,345
You are quite an odd one,
aren't you?

319
00:32:03,921 --> 00:32:06,048
I mean, look at you.
Are you color-coordinated?

320
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:10,250
Pink clogs and this orange thing.
Are you a clam digger or something?

321
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:11,826
I don't mean that
in a lesbian sense.

322
00:32:12,028 --> 00:32:15,726
- I think you mean "carpet muncher."
- I'm not judging. I'm not...

323
00:32:15,932 --> 00:32:18,163
- Hello.
- Can we just not get personal?

324
00:32:18,368 --> 00:32:19,768
Look at this. No!

325
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:21,994
Look,
it's the wrong photograph!

326
00:32:22,205 --> 00:32:25,642
I mean, this is old Loomis.
This is new.

327
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:29,676
Yes, well, old Loomis increases
sales by 25 percent, okay? So just...

328
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,847
I'm not going in there
until you go get me

329
00:32:32,048 --> 00:32:36,076
a cup of PG tips with a splash of
milk, and I want it sizzling hot.

330
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,311
PG what?

331
00:32:38,521 --> 00:32:39,784
Tea?

332
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:41,719
We don't have time.

333
00:32:43,059 --> 00:32:45,050
Fine. Fine,
I'll go find you some.

334
00:32:45,261 --> 00:32:47,355
- Two percent.
- Two percent.

335
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:05,981
Wow, the princess of
punctuality is a little late.

336
00:33:06,182 --> 00:33:09,084
Alert the authorities. Laurie
has been replaced by a pod.

337
00:33:09,286 --> 00:33:11,846
Whoa, wait, I'm early.
I worked overtime last night.

338
00:33:12,056 --> 00:33:16,220
Oh. See, you're too together. No,
you gotta loosen up a little, babe.

339
00:33:16,426 --> 00:33:18,587
You know, bring some
anarchy to the party.

340
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:21,526
So you're saying I can start
showing up whenever I want?

341
00:33:21,731 --> 00:33:23,461
Not on my dime, sister.

342
00:33:23,666 --> 00:33:25,531
You can save the slacker shit

343
00:33:25,736 --> 00:33:28,534
for those corporate bloodsuckers
who can afford it.

344
00:33:28,739 --> 00:33:30,569
That's why we're going
down the toilet.

345
00:33:30,773 --> 00:33:34,471
Since 1946, this country has
been under the military-industrial...

346
00:33:34,677 --> 00:33:37,407
Fuck the man.
- Right on, sister.

347
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:41,983
You're really interested.
I know, I know.

348
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:47,354
I give in. You win.
The old man caves again.

349
00:33:47,892 --> 00:33:49,483
What's up with him?
I don't know.

350
00:33:49,692 --> 00:33:51,490
Are you gonna come
and rock balls

351
00:33:51,694 --> 00:33:53,595
with Harley and me at
the Phantom Jam or what?

352
00:33:53,797 --> 00:33:55,491
Hells yeah.

353
00:33:55,699 --> 00:33:59,134
But I'm not sure if I'm down with
the whole costume concept.

354
00:33:59,336 --> 00:34:02,169
What? Okay, wait.
Think of it like this.

355
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,432
It's so lame that
it's totally cool again.

356
00:34:05,375 --> 00:34:07,708
Well, I still
like my idea better.

357
00:34:08,278 --> 00:34:09,711
What up, dick-lickers?

358
00:34:09,914 --> 00:34:12,576
Could you please convince
Miss Too-Coolio-for-Schoolio

359
00:34:12,782 --> 00:34:14,579
that our costume idea is totally rad?

360
00:34:14,784 --> 00:34:18,744
Dude, suck it up, ho. We got a fucking
theme going on. Don't screw it up.

361
00:34:18,956 --> 00:34:21,048
Plus we got you
that sick maid outfit

362
00:34:21,257 --> 00:34:22,918
and dudes dig the domestic.

363
00:34:23,126 --> 00:34:25,925
Come on, you guys, it's
borderline drama-class nerd.

364
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,824
- Yeah. Own it.
- All right. What do I have to do?

365
00:34:28,032 --> 00:34:30,431
Stand on this chair and show the
old hippie dude my tits again?

366
00:34:30,634 --> 00:34:31,760
- No.
- Oh, Meat!

367
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:33,458
- Check out my lady lumps!
- No, no, no.

368
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:36,137
- I'll wear it.
- Put down your fucking shirt.

369
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,329
You give in too easy.

370
00:34:37,541 --> 00:34:39,634
All right,
you guys ready for it?

371
00:34:39,842 --> 00:34:41,867
For what?
- Are you ready?

372
00:34:42,112 --> 00:34:44,739
- Kick out the jams, motherfuckers!
- Whoo!

373
00:34:52,889 --> 00:34:56,382
<i>Michael, I'm sorry to tell you this,</i>

374
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:59,585
<i>but your mother has passed away.</i>

375
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:01,657
<i>She'll be back.</i>

376
00:35:01,864 --> 00:35:05,858
<i>No, I'm afraid she won't be
coming to see you anymore.</i>

377
00:35:06,302 --> 00:35:09,965
<i>I'll see her again,
but I won't see you.</i>

378
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:14,001
Ladies and
gentlemen, Dr. Samuel Loomis,

379
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:19,273
<i>author of The Devil Walks Among
Us, in stores October 31 st.</i>

380
00:35:19,717 --> 00:35:22,914
Thank you all and welcome.

381
00:35:23,487 --> 00:35:25,614
I think you can all see
quite clearly here

382
00:35:25,822 --> 00:35:27,585
that Michael's psychotic perception

383
00:35:27,791 --> 00:35:32,159
is in complete denial about his
own mother's suicide

384
00:35:32,362 --> 00:35:35,730
Freud would certainly have a field day
with that little one, wouldn't he?

385
00:35:38,202 --> 00:35:41,898
So it is the fate of all of us

386
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:46,599
to direct our first
sexual impulses towards our mothers

387
00:35:47,143 --> 00:35:51,512
and our first murderess hatred
against our fathers.

388
00:35:51,815 --> 00:35:56,148
Now, in Michael's case,
I became the surrogate father.

389
00:35:56,353 --> 00:36:01,552
The last father
in a long series of fathers.

390
00:36:01,992 --> 00:36:05,358
Well, um, has anybody
got any questions at all?

391
00:36:05,561 --> 00:36:07,188
Yes, sir. Yes. Please.

392
00:36:07,597 --> 00:36:11,590
Um, you never really made it clear whether
you believe it was nurture or nature

393
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:13,996
that contributed
to Michael's condition.

394
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:18,130
I would like to answer it, in part,
by quoting

395
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:20,673
the great George Bernard Shaw,

396
00:36:20,878 --> 00:36:23,938
with a little Loomis twist
at the end.

397
00:36:24,148 --> 00:36:29,050
"In the arts of life,
man invents nothing.

398
00:36:29,253 --> 00:36:33,518
But in the arts of death,
he outdoes nature herself

399
00:36:34,257 --> 00:36:37,693
and produces,
by chemistry and machinery,

400
00:36:37,894 --> 00:36:42,525
all the slaughter of plague,
pestilence, famine"

401
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:44,963
and Michael Myers.

402
00:36:46,769 --> 00:36:49,603
Well, sorry, but I like that little one.

403
00:36:51,175 --> 00:36:52,436
That's my own
little twist.

404
00:36:52,742 --> 00:36:53,800
Yes, ma'am?

405
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:58,242
Do you feel personally responsible for
the deaths of as many as 15 victims?

406
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:05,313
I have tremendous sympathy
for all the families involved.

407
00:37:05,521 --> 00:37:10,221
And do I personally feel
responsible? Ma'am, no, I do not.

408
00:37:10,427 --> 00:37:12,452
And I've said that many times.

409
00:37:12,663 --> 00:37:15,222
It's just awful and, um,

410
00:37:15,431 --> 00:37:17,865
I was very nearly a victim myself.

411
00:37:18,068 --> 00:37:22,197
I'm not a psychic Sherlock Holmes
playing Superman.

412
00:37:22,438 --> 00:37:25,567
Since the authorities haven't
been able to produce a body,

413
00:37:25,775 --> 00:37:28,210
do you think Michael
is alive or dead?

414
00:37:29,278 --> 00:37:30,677
<i>Will he kill again?</i>

415
00:37:31,014 --> 00:37:32,275
Here we go again.

416
00:37:33,684 --> 00:37:38,052
Look, let me make things
nice and sparkling clear.

417
00:37:38,255 --> 00:37:40,416
Michael Myers is fucking dead!

418
00:37:40,623 --> 00:37:42,887
Now, do you brain-dead
gossip mongers

419
00:37:43,092 --> 00:37:47,188
want me to spell it out for you?
D-E-A-D!

420
00:38:35,144 --> 00:38:36,737
Michael.

421
00:38:37,713 --> 00:38:38,942
Halloween is coming.

422
00:38:40,416 --> 00:38:41,884
You have to get ready.

423
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,253
We are counting on you
to bring us home this year.

424
00:38:45,889 --> 00:38:47,789
I won't let you down.

425
00:38:48,724 --> 00:38:50,659
I know you won't, baby.

426
00:38:51,728 --> 00:38:53,126
I love you, Mama.

427
00:38:54,764 --> 00:38:57,164
I love you too, Michael.

428
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:02,268
It's that same
guy who's been coming.

429
00:39:02,472 --> 00:39:03,460
You seen him before?

430
00:39:03,673 --> 00:39:04,731
Yeah, it's the same filthy bum.

431
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:07,570
Stealing our shit.
- I'd recognize him anywhere, Daddy.

432
00:39:07,777 --> 00:39:08,835
Motherfucker.

433
00:39:09,112 --> 00:39:13,208
Can't have drifters just coming in
here and taking whatever they want.

434
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:15,048
What y'all gonna do?

435
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,880
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

436
00:39:24,027 --> 00:39:25,585
Shut up, Ivan.
We see him.

437
00:39:25,929 --> 00:39:26,918
Let's do it.

438
00:39:36,739 --> 00:39:38,570
You're just gonna scare him.

439
00:39:38,775 --> 00:39:42,074
- Daddy, what the fuck?
- Safety.

440
00:39:45,248 --> 00:39:48,309
Hey, you stupid, slimy dick.

441
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:52,784
I told you if you came on this land
again, I'd beat the fuck out of you.

442
00:39:53,322 --> 00:39:55,882
What the fuck you think
you're doing here?

443
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:58,789
As big as he is dumb, man.

444
00:39:58,996 --> 00:40:02,590
Look at that. He's about
7-foot of fuck-tard.

445
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,333
I'm talking to you, shit-heel.

446
00:40:05,534 --> 00:40:07,559
You stupid fuck!

447
00:40:08,938 --> 00:40:11,702
I'm talking to you!

448
00:40:12,742 --> 00:40:14,438
What's wrong with
this son of a bitch?

449
00:40:14,644 --> 00:40:16,135
Give him a taste of that here.

450
00:40:19,315 --> 00:40:20,748
All right.

451
00:40:20,951 --> 00:40:22,815
Hey! No! You'll fucking kill him.

452
00:40:23,019 --> 00:40:24,646
Wanna go to jail for
killing that fucking turd?

453
00:40:24,855 --> 00:40:26,447
One more shot. Shut up!

454
00:40:26,956 --> 00:40:28,423
Woo-hoo-hoo.

455
00:40:28,625 --> 00:40:30,650
Chris, knock it off.

456
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:33,621
- Big man.
- Oh, man.

457
00:40:33,829 --> 00:40:36,264
Come on, Daddy.
Don't you come back, son of a bitch.

458
00:40:36,465 --> 00:40:38,695
Man, that was a professional
ass-whupping there.

459
00:40:39,369 --> 00:40:41,393
Oh, I'm jacked.

460
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:42,594
Whoo!

461
00:40:43,606 --> 00:40:45,802
You okay?
- Shut up, Ivan!

462
00:40:46,009 --> 00:40:49,445
I'm so sorry. What are we gonna
do, just fucking leave him out here?

463
00:40:49,646 --> 00:40:50,943
Get in the truck.

464
00:40:51,148 --> 00:40:52,637
Come on now. Chop-chop.

465
00:40:52,849 --> 00:40:54,679
- Get in the truck.
- I'm so sorry.

466
00:40:55,085 --> 00:40:57,246
I am so sorry.

467
00:40:59,755 --> 00:41:01,746
Shut up, Ivan.

468
00:41:10,934 --> 00:41:12,333
- Whoo.
- Seriously.

469
00:41:18,742 --> 00:41:20,175
Jump up.
- You didn't need to

470
00:41:20,376 --> 00:41:22,003
fucking beat him to a pulp.

471
00:41:23,179 --> 00:41:26,342
- I told the guy.
- Fuck that.

472
00:41:29,786 --> 00:41:30,775
Oh, my God!

473
00:41:32,655 --> 00:41:34,021
Fuck!

474
00:41:37,327 --> 00:41:38,385
No, Daddy!

475
00:42:07,824 --> 00:42:11,315
What are you doing?
I said I was fucking sorry!

476
00:42:37,554 --> 00:42:38,646
Pizza.

477
00:42:38,855 --> 00:42:41,880
- Dude, you didn't get whole wheat.
- I forgot.

478
00:42:42,092 --> 00:42:43,081
Mm-hm.

479
00:42:43,293 --> 00:42:45,454
Anybody hungry?

480
00:42:45,661 --> 00:42:48,688
- Starving like Marvin.
- Starving like Marvin.

481
00:42:48,898 --> 00:42:51,766
Has anybody at this table
ever wondered

482
00:42:51,967 --> 00:42:53,195
who Marvin is?

483
00:42:53,402 --> 00:42:56,269
I mean, the original Marvin
who was starving Marvin?

484
00:42:56,472 --> 00:42:59,135
- What?
- Was it...? Was it Lee Marvin?

485
00:42:59,342 --> 00:43:01,275
Who's Lee Marvin?

486
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:02,938
"Who's Lee Marvin?"

487
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:04,403
Did I stutter?

488
00:43:06,016 --> 00:43:09,452
<i>Paint Your Wagon.
The Professionals. Lee Marvin.</i>

489
00:43:09,652 --> 00:43:11,382
<i>Cat Ballou?</i>

490
00:43:12,621 --> 00:43:15,056
<i>Cat Ballou.
He was great in Cat Ballou.</i>

491
00:43:15,291 --> 00:43:19,057
I can't believe you guys haven't seen
it. He was, like, playing this drunk,

492
00:43:19,528 --> 00:43:21,963
but he's, like, the
greatest gun in the West.

493
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:23,563
At one point he's, like,

494
00:43:23,766 --> 00:43:25,860
talking about being a gunslinger.

495
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:28,663
Bam. And he misses the barn.

496
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:33,402
He misses the barn completely.

497
00:43:34,911 --> 00:43:38,347
I wanna thank the both of you for
making me feel as old as Methuselah.

498
00:43:38,547 --> 00:43:42,005
All I know is I hope that dead, rotting
flesh didn't bump on my pineapple.

499
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:44,311
A little dead, rotting flesh
never hurt anybody.

500
00:43:44,521 --> 00:43:47,251
Oh, God. Do we have to do this
every fucking time we eat together?

501
00:43:47,456 --> 00:43:49,686
We need to get you off
the animal products, Mr. B.

502
00:43:49,893 --> 00:43:53,226
Not gonna happen.
- Man was meant to eat meat.

503
00:43:53,429 --> 00:43:56,422
We, all of us, have a
little bit of caveman in us.

504
00:44:04,106 --> 00:44:05,096
God.

505
00:44:11,748 --> 00:44:13,943
How is it possible
that every father

506
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:16,585
perfects the art of humiliating
their offspring?

507
00:44:16,952 --> 00:44:18,385
What? It's cute.

508
00:44:18,855 --> 00:44:19,844
Mm-hm.

509
00:44:36,139 --> 00:44:38,733
- What?
- Come on, Annie.

510
00:44:38,974 --> 00:44:40,806
I'll go. I always go.

511
00:45:00,329 --> 00:45:02,126
Hang on.

512
00:45:02,632 --> 00:45:04,190
God.

513
00:45:07,804 --> 00:45:09,896
- Here.
- Thanks.

514
00:45:11,407 --> 00:45:13,534
Sorry I was such
a bitch earlier.

515
00:45:15,144 --> 00:45:16,976
I get it.

516
00:45:20,983 --> 00:45:22,349
Okay.

517
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,347
Where have you been?
I've been waiting.

518
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:56,617
You know
I can't come here anymore.

519
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:59,117
My time here is over.

520
00:45:59,322 --> 00:46:02,085
- You're here now.
- Michael,

521
00:46:02,291 --> 00:46:04,226
you know
I'm not really here.

522
00:46:04,693 --> 00:46:06,389
I wanna show you something.

523
00:46:07,429 --> 00:46:08,657
All right.

524
00:46:29,385 --> 00:46:30,784
I found her.

525
00:46:30,987 --> 00:46:33,045
I found Boo.

526
00:46:45,367 --> 00:46:46,766
My baby.

527
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:52,364
Can we be a family again?

528
00:46:53,909 --> 00:46:55,844
Not yet, Michael.

529
00:46:56,045 --> 00:46:57,103
Not yet.

530
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:04,844
Oh, fuck.

531
00:47:14,197 --> 00:47:16,391
Come here, buddy.

532
00:47:36,853 --> 00:47:38,150
So, Dr. Loomis, tell me.

533
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:39,947
How long do you plan on
staying in town?

534
00:47:40,155 --> 00:47:41,748
Please. Sam.

535
00:47:41,958 --> 00:47:44,289
Thank you. Well, I could
stay a few extra days.

536
00:47:44,626 --> 00:47:47,994
It depends on if there's something
or someone that motivated me.

537
00:47:48,197 --> 00:47:49,186
Excuse me, Dr. Loomis...

538
00:47:49,398 --> 00:47:50,626
We're in... I'm in the
middle of something.

539
00:47:50,833 --> 00:47:52,233
Could I speak to you
for a second? Please?

540
00:47:52,434 --> 00:47:54,699
- What?
- Please?

541
00:47:54,903 --> 00:47:58,532
Excuse me, my dear.
I won't be one second.

542
00:47:59,242 --> 00:48:00,231
What?

543
00:48:00,443 --> 00:48:02,570
Okay, I am all for
selling books. All right?

544
00:48:02,778 --> 00:48:05,873
God knows I've done some
things that I'm not proud of,

545
00:48:06,081 --> 00:48:10,313
but this is disgusting.
I did not agree to this backdrop.

546
00:48:10,519 --> 00:48:12,510
I mean, what's next?
Heading over to the cemetery

547
00:48:12,722 --> 00:48:14,451
and dancing on
the victims' graves?

548
00:48:14,657 --> 00:48:17,557
Look, I don't think you
quite understand

549
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:21,197
- what I'm trying to accomplish here.
- Well, fair enough. I don't.

550
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:23,797
Please, explain it to me.
I would really like to understand.

551
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,902
I'm selling the sizzle,
not the steak.

552
00:48:28,271 --> 00:48:29,795
- The sizzle?
- Yes.

553
00:48:30,306 --> 00:48:33,672
The sizzle. It's bad taste
is what it is.

554
00:48:33,943 --> 00:48:35,773
It's just gonna add fuel
to the lynch mob fire.

555
00:48:35,978 --> 00:48:38,106
- Bad taste? Bad taste?
- Yes.

556
00:48:38,347 --> 00:48:41,476
My God, it's business, woman! Business.

557
00:48:41,717 --> 00:48:45,050
Besides, bad taste is the petrol
that drives the American dream.

558
00:48:46,121 --> 00:48:47,282
Well, I think it's a mistake.

559
00:48:47,489 --> 00:48:49,047
- Oh, yeah, you do, do you?
- Yes.

560
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:52,422
Well, when I want your opinion,
I'll beat it out of you.

561
00:48:53,262 --> 00:48:58,666
Here. Now, take that and go sit in
the car. Go on. Get your ass in there.

562
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:00,960
Okay. Hi, where do you want me?

563
00:50:27,724 --> 00:50:29,554
<i>Die, you fucking bitch!</i>

564
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:32,387
<i>You fucking bitch!
I'm gonna fucking kill you.</i>

565
00:50:32,795 --> 00:50:35,490
<i>I'm gonna fuck you...
Rip your fucking throat.</i>

566
00:50:35,731 --> 00:50:38,326
Fucking die, you fucking bitch!

567
00:50:38,534 --> 00:50:39,762
<i>You fucking cunt!</i>

568
00:50:39,969 --> 00:50:41,527
<i>Fucking bitch!</i>

569
00:50:41,771 --> 00:50:42,965
Please, Laurie, please!

570
00:50:44,641 --> 00:50:48,474
You fucking...
Die, you fucking bitch!

571
00:50:51,514 --> 00:50:55,416
Laurie! Laurie, Laurie, Laurie!

572
00:51:31,219 --> 00:51:32,447
Argh!

573
00:51:33,422 --> 00:51:36,653
- You guys like Frankenstein?
- Yes.

574
00:51:36,893 --> 00:51:38,621
Who likes popcorn?

575
00:51:38,827 --> 00:51:41,057
<i>So I was going through the park,</i>

576
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:45,166
and there was this
really crazy Frankenstein.

577
00:51:45,969 --> 00:51:47,960
<i>And he was, like, yelling at the kids.</i>

578
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:51,264
And he was yelling at them,
like, perverted things and stuff.

579
00:51:51,474 --> 00:51:55,342
And I really thought it was funny
and I stopped and watched.

580
00:51:55,811 --> 00:51:59,679
<i>And then I saw, I saw this umm..
like this, like this farm.</i>

581
00:51:59,882 --> 00:52:02,248
Laurie?
- And this lady let me hold the pig.

582
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:04,215
What are you
feeling right now, Laurie?

583
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:06,684
The pig really liked me
and she said that the pig

584
00:52:06,889 --> 00:52:08,856
- Laurie?
- Liked me. I wanted to take it home.

585
00:52:09,057 --> 00:52:10,958
Sit down, Laurie.

586
00:52:12,628 --> 00:52:13,686
Come on, Laurie.

587
00:52:14,864 --> 00:52:16,297
Stay centered.
What's going on?

588
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:22,134
I had this really, really,
really crazy attack.

589
00:52:22,338 --> 00:52:25,773
And not while I was asleep,
while I was awake.

590
00:52:25,974 --> 00:52:29,467
Look, I just need you to
prescribe me something, please.

591
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:33,012
Laurie, according to my notes, you
should have a lot of medication.

592
00:52:33,215 --> 00:52:35,240
I don't. I'm out.

593
00:52:35,550 --> 00:52:39,043
Look, I need you to get your magic
pen and your magic piece of paper,

594
00:52:39,255 --> 00:52:41,985
and I need you to write me up
a prescription, please.

595
00:52:42,190 --> 00:52:45,626
Laurie, that's not the answer. Are
you doing your breathing exercises?

596
00:52:45,827 --> 00:52:48,092
- Breathing exercises?
- Yes, it helps.

597
00:52:48,297 --> 00:52:50,856
- Breathing exercises aren't gonna cut it.
- They help, Laurie.

598
00:52:51,067 --> 00:52:53,467
- And I can't deal with this!
- Oh, honey.

599
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:56,833
I'm not strong enough and
I'm tired of pretending that I am.

600
00:52:57,039 --> 00:52:59,507
Look, Laurie, listen to me.
Stay with me.

601
00:52:59,708 --> 00:53:02,507
You are so much stronger
than you think you are. You are.

602
00:53:02,711 --> 00:53:07,512
- Now, go on, sit down. Sit down.
- You better fucking let me go

603
00:53:07,717 --> 00:53:10,277
and give me
some fucking prescriptions!

604
00:53:10,485 --> 00:53:13,148
I'm gonna give you some
Haldol to tide you over.

605
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:15,414
- Haldol?
- Yes, Haldol.

606
00:53:15,625 --> 00:53:18,492
- It'll take some of these thoughts away.
- I don't want Haldol.

607
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:23,222
- I want my prescription!
- I'm so sorry you're going through this.

608
00:53:23,432 --> 00:53:24,661
Fuck, you know what?

609
00:53:24,867 --> 00:53:27,391
Fuck you and fuck this!

610
00:53:27,603 --> 00:53:29,934
"How are you, Laurie?

611
00:53:30,139 --> 00:53:32,369
I'm so concerned
at 100 bucks an hour."

612
00:53:32,641 --> 00:53:36,304
You know what? I would be fucking
concerned at 100 bucks an hour.

613
00:53:36,512 --> 00:53:38,536
- I'm really concerned right now.
- Bullshit.

614
00:53:38,748 --> 00:53:42,309
- No, it's not bullshit.
You know what, you're more fucked up than I am,

615
00:53:42,518 --> 00:53:43,576
you crazy bitch!

616
00:53:56,733 --> 00:54:00,396
<i>For most of us, Michael
Myers is a mysterious legend of evil.</i>

617
00:54:00,603 --> 00:54:02,001
<i>But for Dr. Samuel Loomis,</i>

618
00:54:02,204 --> 00:54:04,434
<i>the bogeyman is all too real.</i>

619
00:54:04,639 --> 00:54:07,871
<i>There have been wild rumors circulating
as to the content of your new book.</i>

620
00:54:08,077 --> 00:54:09,567
<i>- What can you tell me?
- Well,</i>

621
00:54:09,778 --> 00:54:11,713
<i>after my last encounter
with Michael,</i>

622
00:54:11,914 --> 00:54:14,382
<i>some startling facts
came to light,</i>

623
00:54:14,684 --> 00:54:17,175
<i>and I just thought that
the public really ought to know.</i>

624
00:54:17,385 --> 00:54:19,114
<i>Such as?</i>

625
00:54:19,554 --> 00:54:21,112
<i>Read the book, as they say.</i>

626
00:54:21,324 --> 00:54:24,588
<i>But weren't you horrified when the news
broke that Michael's body went missing?</i>

627
00:54:24,793 --> 00:54:26,762
<i>No, not really.</i>

628
00:54:27,096 --> 00:54:30,724
<i>How you can lose a body, you
know, transporting it from A to B.</i>

629
00:54:31,134 --> 00:54:34,103
<i>You better ask the sheriff's
department that one. Heh, heh, heh.</i>

630
00:54:34,302 --> 00:54:35,998
<i>Well, do you think
that the body will reappear?</i>

631
00:54:36,304 --> 00:54:38,795
<i>Yes, probably. You know,
somewhere it'll reappear,</i>

632
00:54:39,007 --> 00:54:42,807
<i>along with the Elephant Man's
bones at some sideshow.</i>

633
00:54:43,012 --> 00:54:45,378
<i>- But as my old Aunt Miri</i>-

634
00:54:45,581 --> 00:54:48,606
<i>"Freaks will always
find their way home."</i>

635
00:55:04,432 --> 00:55:06,367
What's up with the booze?

636
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:11,231
Oh, yeah. Meet my new
best friend.

637
00:55:11,574 --> 00:55:13,905
Oh, is this how
your new work friends roll?

638
00:55:14,677 --> 00:55:17,009
Maybe. Jealous?

639
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,905
- Whatever.
- You know what Annie?

640
00:55:21,117 --> 00:55:22,914
I don't need your shit.

641
00:55:25,353 --> 00:55:27,822
You don't need
my shit?

642
00:55:28,023 --> 00:55:31,925
You don't need my shit?
I put up with your shit, 24-7.

643
00:55:32,427 --> 00:55:35,659
You better back the fuck off!

644
00:55:35,864 --> 00:55:38,163
Or what, huh?
The fuck are you gonna do?

645
00:55:38,367 --> 00:55:42,063
You know what, you act like you're the
only one whose life got fucking trashed.

646
00:55:42,271 --> 00:55:45,501
I'm so not buying
the new Laurie act.

647
00:55:45,708 --> 00:55:47,869
I'm not putting up
with your moaning shit.

648
00:55:48,077 --> 00:55:52,980
Get the fuck out of my room!
Get the fuck out of my room!

649
00:55:54,717 --> 00:55:56,809
I'm not impressed.

650
00:56:00,389 --> 00:56:01,356
Fuck!

651
00:56:12,268 --> 00:56:14,099
"Hey, Howard.

652
00:56:14,302 --> 00:56:18,170
Can't afford the new tits.
Can you loan me some bones?"

653
00:56:20,275 --> 00:56:21,264
Fucking whore.

654
00:56:21,476 --> 00:56:23,637
Hey! Hey, Misty, come here.

655
00:56:23,846 --> 00:56:25,813
Come on, it's on.
Come on, it's finally on.

656
00:56:26,014 --> 00:56:29,211
I'm on TV. You're missing it. Move
your ass. Come here. Look at this!

657
00:56:29,418 --> 00:56:30,715
Oh, my God, baby.

658
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:32,717
Ha, ha, ha. Look at
that. I'm incredible.

659
00:56:32,922 --> 00:56:35,652
<i>The smile you'll have on
your face at the Rabbit In Red Lounge</i>

660
00:56:35,858 --> 00:56:39,385
<i>when you come and you see some of my
girls dance because they are fantastic.</i>

661
00:56:39,594 --> 00:56:41,324
Hey, Howard,
where are those drinks?

662
00:56:42,864 --> 00:56:45,458
Hey, boss. That's
right, they love you, man.

663
00:56:45,668 --> 00:56:48,534
- That's why the whole town loves you.
- Yeah, they love me.

664
00:56:48,737 --> 00:56:50,762
They love me like cancer,
that's how much they love me.

665
00:56:50,972 --> 00:56:52,702
You look like
that big guy.

666
00:56:54,476 --> 00:56:55,807
The shit falls on his head.

667
00:56:56,012 --> 00:56:58,070
"Grandfather, I'm mad,
I'm pissed off.

668
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:01,648
Hey, where's my daughter with the
cans and the blond hair and the...?"

669
00:57:01,851 --> 00:57:03,250
What are you talking about?

670
00:57:03,652 --> 00:57:05,518
Yeah. Green makes you look sexy, baby.

671
00:57:06,956 --> 00:57:08,650
Green. That suits you, man.

672
00:57:08,858 --> 00:57:12,726
It really suits you. It's like
the color of money. Ka-ching.

673
00:57:13,461 --> 00:57:15,088
Dumbass.
Ha-ha-ha.

674
00:57:15,297 --> 00:57:17,231
Hey, Howard, let
me ask you a question.

675
00:57:17,432 --> 00:57:18,559
I got a riddle for you.

676
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:22,329
What does a stripper do with her
asshole before she dances.

677
00:57:22,771 --> 00:57:24,797
I don't know.

678
00:57:25,106 --> 00:57:28,974
She gives him 10 bucks and she
tells him to take out the trash!

679
00:57:31,179 --> 00:57:34,775
- That's a good one.
- Here, Howard. Take out the trash.

680
00:57:34,983 --> 00:57:36,610
Take out the trash,
Howard.

681
00:57:36,818 --> 00:57:38,376
He's good at
taking out the trash.

682
00:57:38,586 --> 00:57:40,248
Ha-ha-ha.
I'm funny.

683
00:57:40,456 --> 00:57:42,889
Yeah, I'm the big joke.

684
00:57:44,059 --> 00:57:46,119
Hey, I'm on TV. Quiet.
Shut up. Shut up.

685
00:57:46,329 --> 00:57:49,092
Enjoy the fucking herpes, old man.

686
00:57:49,297 --> 00:57:52,391
- I got an aura.
- You got an aura, baby.

687
00:57:52,601 --> 00:57:54,090
You have an aura.
You got two auras.

688
00:57:54,302 --> 00:57:56,567
- You're so bad.
- Heh, heh. Really?

689
00:57:56,771 --> 00:57:59,172
- Auras are popping out.
- Ha! Let me see those auras.

690
00:58:06,081 --> 00:58:08,242
Two-faced bitch.

691
00:58:12,688 --> 00:58:16,351
Fucking Hoss. I'm fucking
Hop Sing doing all the chores.

692
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:18,150
You bitch.

693
00:58:20,061 --> 00:58:22,586
"Yeah, Howard.

694
00:58:22,797 --> 00:58:27,201
Can I have some money for
my dad's blood transfusion?"

695
00:58:28,536 --> 00:58:30,936
What the fuck you doing, man,

696
00:58:31,139 --> 00:58:33,574
sneaking around back here?

697
00:58:35,543 --> 00:58:36,943
Hey.

698
00:58:38,246 --> 00:58:40,715
The boss don't like you
bums hanging out back here,

699
00:58:40,916 --> 00:58:43,407
rooting around
through the Dumpsters.

700
00:58:43,918 --> 00:58:46,012
So get a move on.

701
00:58:51,226 --> 00:58:53,092
Look, man.

702
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:55,925
Don't give me no reason.

703
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:02,134
I already sent some
sorry fucking jag-off

704
00:59:02,338 --> 00:59:04,498
to the emergency room
tonight.

705
00:59:05,775 --> 00:59:06,867
So

706
00:59:07,076 --> 00:59:10,101
I suggest you
take the easy road out

707
00:59:11,679 --> 00:59:13,579
and hit the bricks, Dorothy.

708
00:59:16,485 --> 00:59:18,851
Heh, fu...

709
00:59:24,726 --> 00:59:26,456
Trust me,

710
00:59:26,661 --> 00:59:29,653
you filthy, dirty hippie,

711
00:59:31,032 --> 00:59:33,364
you don't wanna be doing that.

712
00:59:33,601 --> 00:59:35,626
Copy that, downtown?

713
00:59:40,009 --> 00:59:40,998
Fuck.

714
01:00:44,730 --> 01:00:46,197
We're done waiting.

715
01:00:46,664 --> 01:00:49,793
Only a river of blood can
bring us back together.

716
01:00:50,335 --> 01:00:52,030
It's up to you.

717
01:00:52,436 --> 01:00:55,166
It's always been
up to you, Michael.

718
01:00:55,373 --> 01:00:58,137
Hey, baby, you know what?
It's after midnight.

719
01:00:58,376 --> 01:01:00,503
So? I don't think my pussy
is gonna turn into a pumpkin.

720
01:01:01,012 --> 01:01:02,913
It's technically Halloween, baby.

721
01:01:03,382 --> 01:01:06,943
How'd you like to be fucked by
the Frankenstein monster, huh?

722
01:01:09,288 --> 01:01:11,983
- You're my bride of Frankenstein.
- Oh, ooh.

723
01:01:12,423 --> 01:01:14,324
Big, green, scary monster!

724
01:01:14,525 --> 01:01:16,721
Oh, no.
Oh, I'm so scared.

725
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:19,692
- Ha, ha, ha. Titties good.
- No.

726
01:01:19,898 --> 01:01:20,989
Ass good.

727
01:01:22,768 --> 01:01:24,201
I'm gonna give it to you good.

728
01:01:24,402 --> 01:01:26,563
I'm gonna give you
my jolly green giant.

729
01:01:26,771 --> 01:01:28,262
Jesus Christ!

730
01:01:30,541 --> 01:01:33,704
What are you doing?
Get the fuck out of here.

731
01:01:34,012 --> 01:01:36,309
Come on, get the fuck
out of here, motherfucker.

732
01:01:37,481 --> 01:01:38,710
You're gonna stare me down?

733
01:01:40,318 --> 01:01:41,809
Stare this down,
motherfucker!

734
01:01:42,019 --> 01:01:45,820
Come on now! I'll fucking blow two
holes right through your fucking mask.

735
01:01:46,023 --> 01:01:49,050
I been to Nam. I'll take you
out, you hear me? I'll fucking...

736
01:02:11,615 --> 01:02:12,981
What are you doing?

737
01:02:39,777 --> 01:02:41,405
Open the door! No!

738
01:02:42,114 --> 01:02:43,775
No! Open the door!

739
01:03:46,344 --> 01:03:49,472
Son of a bitch!

740
01:03:49,713 --> 01:03:51,909
You fucking did it!

741
01:03:57,422 --> 01:04:00,016
Fuck,
what am I gonna do?

742
01:04:06,030 --> 01:04:07,623
<i>- Hello?
- Hey, princess.</i>

743
01:04:07,833 --> 01:04:09,164
Hey, Dad. What's up?

744
01:04:09,367 --> 01:04:11,891
Listen, is, uh, is Laurie around?

745
01:04:12,103 --> 01:04:13,661
<i>I'd like to talk to her.</i>

746
01:04:13,871 --> 01:04:16,204
No, she left before I got up.
Why, what's up?

747
01:04:16,407 --> 01:04:18,273
Well, could you do me a favor?

748
01:04:18,476 --> 01:04:21,344
Could you find her
and then call me when you do?

749
01:04:21,545 --> 01:04:22,706
Why? What's going on?

750
01:04:22,914 --> 01:04:25,382
Uh, sweetie, I gotta tell you
about that later.

751
01:04:25,583 --> 01:04:28,246
<i>Could you just do me
that favor, please?</i>

752
01:04:28,452 --> 01:04:30,579
<i>- Everything okay?
- Everything is fine.</i>

753
01:04:30,789 --> 01:04:32,813
I just need to talk to her, sweetie.
Okay?

754
01:05:36,288 --> 01:05:38,347
He's still out there.

755
01:05:38,657 --> 01:05:42,353
Rich and famous.
All because of our pain.

756
01:05:44,195 --> 01:05:46,025
<i>I hope he's having fun.</i>

757
01:05:46,231 --> 01:05:49,427
Are you a real redhead?
Thank you. Have a good one.

758
01:05:49,634 --> 01:05:50,623
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

759
01:05:50,835 --> 01:05:52,132
It's going very
well, indeed. Well done.

760
01:05:52,336 --> 01:05:55,329
Yes, look at the crowd.
It's great. Great.

761
01:05:55,539 --> 01:05:57,804
Right, well done.

762
01:05:58,009 --> 01:06:00,637
Ah. Thank you.
Can you make it out to, uh...?

763
01:06:00,844 --> 01:06:03,905
- I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous. Chett.
- Calm down, calm down.

764
01:06:04,114 --> 01:06:05,376
- Big deep breath.
- Thanks.

765
01:06:05,583 --> 01:06:09,144
Chett Johns.
No, no, actually, you know what?

766
01:06:09,353 --> 01:06:12,721
- Chett, the bringer of death.
- Okay.

767
01:06:12,923 --> 01:06:14,186
That's Chett with two T's.

768
01:06:14,391 --> 01:06:17,384
- Chett, the bringer of...
- The bringer of

769
01:06:17,596 --> 01:06:20,724
death. Oh, man,
that is so awesome.

770
01:06:20,931 --> 01:06:21,920
- There you go.
- Thank you. Look,

771
01:06:22,132 --> 01:06:23,394
I just wanted
to let you know

772
01:06:23,601 --> 01:06:25,695
that Michael is so much
deeper than those other guys.

773
01:06:25,903 --> 01:06:28,134
Like Dahmer
and that bitch Bundy

774
01:06:28,340 --> 01:06:31,969
because he eats at the core
of the victim's soul, you know?

775
01:06:32,177 --> 01:06:35,043
- How people ostracize those...
- All right. Well, thanks so much.

776
01:06:35,246 --> 01:06:37,009
- You're the man. You're the man.
- You're the man!

777
01:06:37,215 --> 01:06:38,704
- All right. Thank you.
- You're the man, dude.

778
01:06:38,916 --> 01:06:40,976
- You're awesome. Thank you.
- Thank you.

779
01:06:42,753 --> 01:06:45,882
Jesus. Well, we
always have one, don't we?

780
01:06:48,092 --> 01:06:49,617
Hi. How are you?

781
01:06:49,860 --> 01:06:52,226
Ah. Oh.

782
01:06:52,597 --> 01:06:54,393
Do you want me to sign this?
What?

783
01:06:54,599 --> 01:06:56,032
You don't recognize her?

784
01:06:56,266 --> 01:06:59,702
- Um... Why? Should I?
- I'm not surprised.

785
01:06:59,903 --> 01:07:02,168
Ahem.
Take a really good look at her.

786
01:07:02,507 --> 01:07:05,567
- Oh, she's beautiful.
- She was beautiful.

787
01:07:06,210 --> 01:07:08,269
- This is my daughter.
- Mm-hm.

788
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:09,969
Lynda.

789
01:07:12,016 --> 01:07:15,474
- Your monster killed her.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

790
01:07:16,054 --> 01:07:18,648
- He butchered her.
- You have my deepest sympathy.

791
01:07:18,856 --> 01:07:21,324
Do I have your deepest sympathy,
you fucking pig?

792
01:07:21,525 --> 01:07:22,925
- I'm truly sorry.
- You killer.

793
01:07:23,128 --> 01:07:24,856
- No, I didn't kill anyone.
- You killer!

794
01:07:25,063 --> 01:07:27,190
All right, everyone, just
calm down. It's all right.

795
01:07:27,398 --> 01:07:29,264
You butchered my baby.
Back up!

796
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,097
You butchered my baby!

797
01:07:31,302 --> 01:07:33,599
- Can we get somebody...?
- I'm gonna get you, Loomis.

798
01:07:33,804 --> 01:07:36,204
I swear... Get your hands off
me. Get your goddamn hands off me!

799
01:07:36,407 --> 01:07:38,932
It's all right. Everyone,
just calm down. Calm down.

800
01:07:39,143 --> 01:07:41,237
- All right, I'm fine.
- Everything's under control.

801
01:07:41,445 --> 01:07:43,003
- You son of a bitch!
- He's got a gun!

802
01:07:43,213 --> 01:07:44,840
- I'm gonna kill you, Loomis!
- Jesus.

803
01:07:45,050 --> 01:07:46,880
I'm gonna kill you, goddamn it!

804
01:07:54,492 --> 01:07:57,085
I mean, the police said
that it wasn't even loaded, so...

805
01:07:57,295 --> 01:08:00,059
Oh, I feel so much better.

806
01:08:00,398 --> 01:08:02,365
All part of the job, I suppose.

807
01:08:02,567 --> 01:08:05,626
Spoon-feeding drivel
to the masses.

808
01:08:06,237 --> 01:08:08,204
Comes with its own bloody price,
doesn't it?

809
01:08:08,405 --> 01:08:09,873
If you say so.

810
01:08:12,876 --> 01:08:14,742
Just what is that tone,
Miss McDonald?

811
01:08:14,945 --> 01:08:17,106
Do you think I'm crossing
the line or something?

812
01:08:17,314 --> 01:08:20,716
I mean, do please feel free
to voice your opinion.

813
01:08:22,252 --> 01:08:23,845
Well, off the record, yes.

814
01:08:24,055 --> 01:08:26,716
Yes, actually, I think this
book crosses quite a few lines.

815
01:08:28,059 --> 01:08:30,823
These are people's lives
you're toying with.

816
01:08:31,029 --> 01:08:33,759
There's gonna be
serious repercussions.

817
01:08:40,171 --> 01:08:41,694
Fuck.

818
01:08:42,207 --> 01:08:43,970
Fuck!

819
01:08:44,175 --> 01:08:46,143
Fuck! Fuck!

820
01:08:46,344 --> 01:08:48,243
Fuck you, motherfucker!

821
01:08:49,146 --> 01:08:50,774
Fuck!

822
01:08:52,716 --> 01:08:54,810
Fuck!

823
01:09:04,028 --> 01:09:05,119
Fucker!

824
01:09:22,180 --> 01:09:23,670
Laurie?

825
01:09:25,182 --> 01:09:27,777
Hey. Hey!

826
01:09:31,256 --> 01:09:32,917
What is...?
Hey, where are you going?

827
01:09:33,123 --> 01:09:34,819
I'm getting the fuck out of here.

828
01:09:35,025 --> 01:09:37,859
Wait. Wait, hey! Listen, my dad
called. He was trying to find you.

829
01:09:38,061 --> 01:09:39,289
Yeah, I bet he was.

830
01:09:39,497 --> 01:09:41,158
Tell me you didn't know,
please!

831
01:09:41,365 --> 01:09:42,993
- Tell me you didn't know.
- Know what?

832
01:09:43,201 --> 01:09:46,693
Fuck it. I mean, daddy's little
princess knows all, right?

833
01:09:46,904 --> 01:09:48,235
What are you
talking about?

834
01:09:48,439 --> 01:09:50,634
Hey, stop. Calm down.
Look at me.

835
01:09:50,841 --> 01:09:52,002
What is going on?

836
01:09:52,210 --> 01:09:55,077
Let me just call my dad, okay?
We can talk to him.

837
01:09:55,279 --> 01:09:57,338
You know what? I have
a message for your dad.

838
01:09:57,548 --> 01:10:01,246
Tell him that Angel says
"fuck you"!

839
01:10:01,586 --> 01:10:03,610
Who is Angel? Laurie!

840
01:10:06,925 --> 01:10:09,256
Hey, fucking asshole!

841
01:10:09,460 --> 01:10:10,791
Fuck you!

842
01:10:10,994 --> 01:10:12,427
Hey, sweetie, did you find her?

843
01:10:12,630 --> 01:10:16,828
Yes. She ran in and she ran
out screaming some shit about:

844
01:10:17,034 --> 01:10:19,229
"Tell your dad that Angel
says 'fuck you."'

845
01:10:19,436 --> 01:10:21,097
<i>Who the fuck is Angel?</i>

846
01:10:22,172 --> 01:10:24,140
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

847
01:10:27,878 --> 01:10:30,779
I want you to head over to my house
and keep an eye on Annie for me. Okay?

848
01:10:30,981 --> 01:10:33,472
Oh, boss, last year she tried
to kick me in the nuts.

849
01:10:33,685 --> 01:10:35,083
You know
she's not gonna like this.

850
01:10:35,319 --> 01:10:36,479
I don't care what she likes.

851
01:10:36,688 --> 01:10:39,087
Now head over to my place,
and if she kicks you out,

852
01:10:39,289 --> 01:10:41,280
you just sit outside with
a shotgun on your lap,

853
01:10:41,492 --> 01:10:44,791
- like you did last year, all right?
- Yes.

854
01:11:00,078 --> 01:11:03,012
Look, um, can I crash here
tonight, please?

855
01:11:03,213 --> 01:11:04,841
Yeah, okay.

856
01:11:05,617 --> 01:11:06,640
What's up?

857
01:11:07,551 --> 01:11:10,578
Look, I just found
something out that's kind of

858
01:11:10,787 --> 01:11:13,154
freaking me the fuck out.

859
01:11:13,658 --> 01:11:15,488
Okay. What is it?

860
01:11:16,426 --> 01:11:18,520
See, I went into this bookstore,

861
01:11:18,729 --> 01:11:20,698
and I got this book and

862
01:11:20,899 --> 01:11:22,729
inside there's just
a bunch of pictures...

863
01:11:22,934 --> 01:11:24,730
Check me out, man.

864
01:11:24,935 --> 01:11:27,199
Fucking sick, huh? Whoo.

865
01:11:27,404 --> 01:11:31,841
I'm a chick dressing up as a
dude who wants to be a chick.

866
01:11:32,243 --> 01:11:34,734
- Shut up.
- What? Who died?

867
01:11:37,247 --> 01:11:39,148
Shit, baby,
did somebody really die?

868
01:11:40,652 --> 01:11:42,813
I'm not me.

869
01:11:43,787 --> 01:11:48,054
I'm not me. Do you understand
what the fuck I'm saying?

870
01:11:48,525 --> 01:11:50,926
- Not really.
- But...

871
01:11:52,029 --> 01:11:53,657
Who are you then?

872
01:11:55,300 --> 01:11:57,564
I'm Angel Myers.

873
01:11:58,802 --> 01:12:01,270
Michael Myers' sister.

874
01:12:01,506 --> 01:12:04,737
Heh. All right, dude, even I
wouldn't fucking touch that joke.

875
01:12:04,943 --> 01:12:07,207
You can't kid around about that
shit. You had me going there.

876
01:12:07,412 --> 01:12:10,404
- You're such a good little actress...
- I am not fucking joking!

877
01:12:10,814 --> 01:12:13,408
All right, if you fucking
think I'm lying, look at this.

878
01:12:13,650 --> 01:12:14,912
All right? Look.

879
01:12:15,118 --> 01:12:17,109
There's me, Angel Myers.

880
01:12:17,322 --> 01:12:20,484
And here's my fucked-up life.

881
01:12:22,327 --> 01:12:23,793
Fuck.

882
01:12:24,761 --> 01:12:26,024
Maybe it's a mistake.
I mean.

883
01:12:29,900 --> 01:12:32,028
Holy shit, dude.

884
01:12:32,270 --> 01:12:33,668
This is fucking insane.

885
01:12:33,871 --> 01:12:36,668
Our next guest gained
infamy as a psychologist

886
01:12:36,873 --> 01:12:38,807
for America's leading serial killer.

887
01:12:39,010 --> 01:12:41,239
"Leading serial killer"? Well,
he's probably the most notorious.

888
01:12:41,445 --> 01:12:43,243
"Leading"?
- He's number one in his field.

889
01:12:43,448 --> 01:12:46,177
<i>Anyway, his new book is called
The Devil Walks Among Us</i>

890
01:12:46,384 --> 01:12:48,875
is available somewhere. Please
welcome Dr. Samuel Loomis.

891
01:12:51,154 --> 01:12:53,020
- Dr. Loomis.
- Hi, David. How are you?

892
01:12:53,224 --> 01:12:54,850
- Have a seat.
- Hi, everyone. Nice to, uh...

893
01:12:55,059 --> 01:12:57,550
Thank you. Thank you. Very nice.

894
01:12:57,795 --> 01:12:59,921
- Mr. Weird, how are you?
- Al's good.

895
01:13:00,131 --> 01:13:01,597
Great.

896
01:13:02,867 --> 01:13:05,563
Now, you've been criticized,
and in some circles, I gotta say,

897
01:13:05,770 --> 01:13:09,103
outright accused of profiteering
off the misery of others.

898
01:13:09,306 --> 01:13:12,002
I mean, how do you even
respond to that criticism?

899
01:13:12,210 --> 01:13:14,677
Well, you know, I think
that's completely unfounded.

900
01:13:14,878 --> 01:13:16,904
I always get permission
when I do the parody.

901
01:13:17,114 --> 01:13:18,810
No, Al, I was talking to Loomis.

902
01:13:19,016 --> 01:13:20,381
Oh, I'm sorry.
Go ahead.

903
01:13:20,585 --> 01:13:23,145
No, no, no, please. It was
fascinating, your answer.

904
01:13:23,354 --> 01:13:25,583
- Your turn. I'm done.
- If you've got something...

905
01:13:27,524 --> 01:13:30,358
Ahem. Actually, I take great
issue with that statement.

906
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:35,463
Besides, I might say that I've
endured quite a lot of misery of my own

907
01:13:35,666 --> 01:13:38,100
in order to tell this story.

908
01:13:38,301 --> 01:13:40,565
Yeah, everyone feels
real bad for you except...

909
01:13:40,771 --> 01:13:43,899
I have never, ever been
so humiliated in all my life!

910
01:13:44,108 --> 01:13:45,769
You were fantastic. Trust me.

911
01:13:45,976 --> 01:13:48,002
- Nonsense! Good night. Thank you.
- Thank you.

912
01:14:06,229 --> 01:14:07,662
- Trick or treat.
- Here you go.

913
01:14:07,864 --> 01:14:09,957
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

914
01:14:21,746 --> 01:14:24,475
Are you a giant?

915
01:14:25,983 --> 01:14:27,917
Can we be friends?

916
01:14:31,088 --> 01:14:34,182
Mark, come on.
Don't talk to strangers.

917
01:14:34,391 --> 01:14:35,518
Bye.

918
01:14:39,764 --> 01:14:42,858
<i>I wanna party. I've spent
my whole fucking life being good</i>

919
01:14:43,067 --> 01:14:44,658
<i>and look where it's gotten me.</i>

920
01:14:44,868 --> 01:14:46,996
Fucking nowhere.

921
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:50,603
Fuck it, you guys.

922
01:14:51,175 --> 01:14:52,971
Are you guys with me or not?

923
01:14:54,145 --> 01:14:56,841
I just... I think that we
should stay back, you know.

924
01:14:57,047 --> 01:14:58,845
I mean, what you need
is a mellow night.

925
01:14:59,050 --> 01:15:02,042
- No, I don't.
- Yeah, definitely. We can just

926
01:15:02,252 --> 01:15:03,652
watch TV or something.

927
01:15:03,854 --> 01:15:05,788
Yeah, like,
order some food

928
01:15:05,989 --> 01:15:08,048
and figure
all this shit out.

929
01:15:08,259 --> 01:15:10,658
I,  want...

930
01:15:11,895 --> 01:15:13,453
to go party!

931
01:15:14,431 --> 01:15:18,630
I wanna fucking get drunk.
I don't fucking care anymore.

932
01:15:19,103 --> 01:15:23,061
I want to fucking party!

933
01:15:23,707 --> 01:15:26,233
- I wanna party.
- Well, you know me. I'm totally in.

934
01:15:26,444 --> 01:15:27,911
Come on, she wants to party.

935
01:15:28,112 --> 01:15:29,511
- Please?
- Oh, please?

936
01:15:29,713 --> 01:15:32,911
Come on. Come on, boo-boo, please?

937
01:15:33,117 --> 01:15:35,744
All right, all right, all right. Fine.

938
01:15:36,587 --> 01:15:39,521
- Has to be a chill night, though.
- Okay, a chill night.

939
01:16:54,532 --> 01:16:57,967
What the fuck? Andy, are you seriously
planning on standing out here all night?

940
01:16:58,168 --> 01:16:59,466
- This is ridiculous.
- Hey, Annie,

941
01:16:59,670 --> 01:17:00,898
I just do what the boss tells me.

942
01:17:01,104 --> 01:17:02,265
Well, I'm the boss
of the boss,

943
01:17:02,472 --> 01:17:05,930
and I say move your shitbox
over there, Kojak. Okay?

944
01:17:06,143 --> 01:17:09,043
And don't make a federal case out
of it. Turn off the damn gumballs.

945
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:11,010
I'll do what I gotta do.

946
01:17:11,215 --> 01:17:13,979
What the fuck are you
gonna do, jackhole?

947
01:17:14,217 --> 01:17:17,779
You'll find out.
- Oh. Ooh, I'll find out?

948
01:17:17,988 --> 01:17:20,582
Ooh. I'm shaking in my boots.

949
01:17:24,295 --> 01:17:27,822
Okay, why don't we get back
to the music.

950
01:17:28,032 --> 01:17:29,795
I get another drink.

951
01:17:31,368 --> 01:17:32,734
Good idea, huh?

952
01:17:32,936 --> 01:17:36,737
Let's go. Captain Clegg
and the Night Creatures.

953
01:17:47,018 --> 01:17:48,246
Yeah!

954
01:18:08,305 --> 01:18:10,069
- Do you like my outfit?
- I do, I do.

955
01:18:10,274 --> 01:18:12,070
What are you supposed to be?
A sexy vampire?

956
01:18:12,275 --> 01:18:16,234
I'm a chick who's dressing
up as a dude who wants to be a chick.

957
01:18:16,447 --> 01:18:18,744
But you are, you are a chick,
though, right?

958
01:18:18,948 --> 01:18:19,938
Watch your step.

959
01:18:20,150 --> 01:18:23,018
Why don't you put your hands
down my pants and find out, Wolfman?

960
01:18:23,220 --> 01:18:26,417
At this point I don't really care.
No, but seriously, you have a vagina?

961
01:18:28,359 --> 01:18:29,347
You're so cute.

962
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:31,323
You're gonna like
my van, though, I promise.

963
01:18:31,529 --> 01:18:33,087
- You got a fucking van?
- Yeah. I got a van.

964
01:18:33,296 --> 01:18:35,527
It's got some drinks in there.
They're roofie-free, I swear.

965
01:18:36,233 --> 01:18:38,827
A "blowjob"? Is that
what you guys call them still?

966
01:18:39,036 --> 01:18:40,832
I call them "sucking a dick."

967
01:18:41,037 --> 01:18:45,030
There she is. She's a beauty.
- She is, isn't she?

968
01:18:45,242 --> 01:18:48,006
I had a lot of fun in
this van. And a lot of pussy.

969
01:18:50,715 --> 01:18:52,238
The Shaggin' Wagon.

970
01:18:52,449 --> 01:18:54,577
It's a work of art.
I like her...

971
01:18:59,856 --> 01:19:03,690
What's the difference between
a jack-o'-lantern and a blond?

972
01:19:03,894 --> 01:19:05,087
What?

973
01:19:05,296 --> 01:19:06,887
There is no difference.

974
01:19:07,097 --> 01:19:11,056
They both have a blank expression,
and they're hollow inside.

975
01:19:15,506 --> 01:19:18,872
I like them, you know what I mean?
You shut the lights off, they glow.

976
01:19:19,076 --> 01:19:21,067
The ladies seem to like it.

977
01:19:21,679 --> 01:19:23,510
Yeah? The ladies
love it?

978
01:19:24,582 --> 01:19:26,105
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

979
01:19:26,317 --> 01:19:28,682
- You get laid a lot?
- I get a good amount.

980
01:19:28,886 --> 01:19:30,581
Hey, hold this, Blondie.

981
01:19:31,689 --> 01:19:34,590
Now Blondie and jack-o'-lantern
both have three holes.

982
01:19:38,162 --> 01:19:40,186
Hey, Gianova, do the trick. Heh-heh.

983
01:19:40,398 --> 01:19:43,560
Watch this. Wow.

984
01:19:46,302 --> 01:19:47,292
I love it.

985
01:19:47,505 --> 01:19:50,804
You look very pretty tonight,
by the way. Very pretty.

986
01:19:51,007 --> 01:19:53,238
I like your tattoos.
Are they real?

987
01:19:54,377 --> 01:19:56,505
- Oh, yeah. They're real.
- They're real? That's cool.

988
01:19:56,713 --> 01:19:58,978
- I was thinking about getting...
- These are real too.

989
01:19:59,182 --> 01:20:02,118
They are real. May I? That's...
They feel real.

990
01:20:02,319 --> 01:20:06,779
- That's... That's nice. That's nice.
- That's it?

991
01:20:10,027 --> 01:20:12,359
You big baby!

992
01:20:13,329 --> 01:20:14,591
Go home!

993
01:20:15,432 --> 01:20:18,425
- Talking's not working, okay?
- I'll shut up.

994
01:20:19,670 --> 01:20:21,569
I'm gonna shut up.

995
01:20:28,546 --> 01:20:32,538
Okay, look. Time out, time
out. I'll be right back.

996
01:20:32,750 --> 01:20:33,978
I'll be right back.
Give me one second.

997
01:20:34,185 --> 01:20:35,880
- Where the fuck are you going, dude?
- I gotta take a piss.

998
01:20:36,086 --> 01:20:37,314
I've had to pee
since I got here.

999
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:38,578
I'll be right back.
Don't go anywhere.

1000
01:20:38,788 --> 01:20:40,722
So who says I wasn't
into the water sports?

1001
01:20:40,925 --> 01:20:41,948
A little golden shower.

1002
01:20:42,158 --> 01:20:45,890
That's gross. You're a trip. I'll
be right back. I'll be right back.

1003
01:20:47,131 --> 01:20:48,119
Hurry the fuck up.

1004
01:20:49,733 --> 01:20:51,701
Fucking hurry up, dude.

1005
01:21:29,105 --> 01:21:30,333
Oh, my God.

1006
01:21:30,608 --> 01:21:33,076
No! No! No!

1007
01:21:33,743 --> 01:21:35,574
Oh, my God. No!

1008
01:22:09,145 --> 01:22:12,207
<i>Welcome Dr. Samuel Loomis.</i>

1009
01:22:13,082 --> 01:22:14,448
<i>Thank you, thank you.</i>

1010
01:22:17,087 --> 01:22:19,885
<i>Dr. Donald Faber, who's a

1011
01:22:20,090 --> 01:22:21,386

01:22:21,591 --> 01:22:24,493

01:22:33,369 --> 01:22:34,962
<i>Snap!</i>

1018
01:22:35,338 --> 01:22:37,398
<i>You got snapped
on by Weird Al.</i>

1019
01:22:38,375 --> 01:22:43,108
<i>If I'd survived a shark attack, you'd
be gushing over every gory detail.</i>

1020
01:22:43,314 --> 01:22:44,679
<i>Begging me to show
the teeth marks.</i>

1021
01:22:44,881 --> 01:22:45,871
God, no. Horrendous.

1022
01:22:46,082 --> 01:22:49,814
<i>Are you telling me there's no difference
between Michael Myers and a shark?</i>

1023
01:22:50,020 --> 01:22:53,148
<i>Of course there is.
Good God, don't be ridiculous.</i>

1024
01:22:53,356 --> 01:22:54,345
<i>I'm a little confused.</i>

1025
01:22:54,557 --> 01:22:56,822
<i>Are we talking about the
Austin Powers Mike Myers</i>

1026
01:22:57,027 --> 01:22:59,791
<i>- or is this...?
- It's over.</i>

1027
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:09,229
Mya!

1028
01:23:14,645 --> 01:23:15,942
Mya!

1029
01:23:18,615 --> 01:23:20,015
Mya!

1030
01:23:26,323 --> 01:23:27,789
Looking
for me? Ha-ha-ha.

1031
01:23:27,992 --> 01:23:30,654
Do you know where Mya is?

1032
01:23:53,917 --> 01:23:55,680
What do you want from me?

1033
01:23:57,488 --> 01:23:59,854
It's almost time to come home, Angel.

1034
01:24:01,257 --> 01:24:03,122
Is she ready?

1035
01:24:03,327 --> 01:24:04,918
Soon.

1036
01:24:17,341 --> 01:24:18,329
Laurie, Laurie.

1037
01:24:18,542 --> 01:24:20,305
Hey, hey! It's me, it's Mya.

1038
01:24:21,578 --> 01:24:23,045
Come on.
Oh, fuck.

1039
01:24:27,350 --> 01:24:30,809
Step. Steppity-steppity-step.

1040
01:24:32,855 --> 01:24:34,948
Hey, I so wanna go back in.

1041
01:24:35,158 --> 01:24:36,786
- And I wanna...
- No, no, no.

1042
01:24:36,993 --> 01:24:38,324
- No. We're going home.
- Hey.

1043
01:24:38,529 --> 01:24:39,962
Where's Harley?

1044
01:24:40,163 --> 01:24:41,256
I don't know.

1045
01:24:41,465 --> 01:24:43,159
- See, we need to go back in and...
- No.

1046
01:24:43,367 --> 01:24:46,131
She went to go hang out with
some dude like she always does.

1047
01:24:46,336 --> 01:24:47,529
She'll find her way home.

1048
01:25:00,317 --> 01:25:01,375
Hello?

1049
01:25:01,585 --> 01:25:03,018
<i>Hey, sweetie.</i>

1050
01:25:03,220 --> 01:25:06,382
Seriously, Dad.
Please stop calling.

1051
01:25:06,590 --> 01:25:07,578
<i>- Okay?
- Oh. Okay.</i>

1052
01:25:19,970 --> 01:25:22,438
I know you love me.

1053
01:25:22,639 --> 01:25:24,402
Oh, God. I love you too.

1054
01:27:34,304 --> 01:27:36,828
I'm glad you decided to come home.

1055
01:27:37,807 --> 01:27:41,868
Running away never solves
anything. Trust me, I've tried.

1056
01:27:42,078 --> 01:27:45,810
I'm sure they have
their reasons for not telling me.

1057
01:27:46,015 --> 01:27:47,916
Figure it out in the morning.

1058
01:27:51,688 --> 01:27:53,279
Hey, world!

1059
01:27:53,489 --> 01:27:55,014
Guess what.

1060
01:27:55,259 --> 01:27:57,954
I'm Michael Myers' sister!

1061
01:27:58,161 --> 01:28:01,061
I'm so fucked!

1062
01:28:03,033 --> 01:28:05,432
What am I gonna do,
dude?

1063
01:28:05,935 --> 01:28:08,166
Just take it one day at a time.

1064
01:28:08,838 --> 01:28:12,036
One day at a time.

1065
01:28:12,242 --> 01:28:15,837
- Annie was right.
- Maybe she's a genius.

1066
01:28:16,445 --> 01:28:18,676
Home sweet home.

1067
01:28:23,587 --> 01:28:26,055
The place is, like, spinning.

1068
01:28:28,492 --> 01:28:31,756
- Want some tea?
- Yeah. What you got?

1069
01:28:36,198 --> 01:28:39,362
<i>- Blended black/green tea?
- Uh-uh.</i>

1070
01:28:41,305 --> 01:28:44,206
- Berry blossom...
- Yeah, berry.

1071
01:28:44,608 --> 01:28:47,770
- Does it have caffeine in it?
- Yeah.

1072
01:28:48,045 --> 01:28:51,980
No. Dude,
I can't fucking read that?

1073
01:28:53,182 --> 01:28:55,082
Oh, yeah, it does.

1074
01:28:55,752 --> 01:28:59,518
It's okay. I'll sleep like a baby
after what we went through tonight.

1075
01:29:05,261 --> 01:29:10,164
Mmm. These cookies are so
good. You should have a cookie.

1076
01:29:10,367 --> 01:29:13,393
It'll help soak up all that
alcohol rotting in your gut.

1077
01:29:13,603 --> 01:29:16,697
Ugh. Don't think a cookie
is gonna save me.

1078
01:29:24,046 --> 01:29:26,310
Oh, my head.

1079
01:29:33,789 --> 01:29:35,849
What the fuck?

1080
01:29:37,894 --> 01:29:39,122
Annie?

1081
01:29:46,502 --> 01:29:47,730
Annie?

1082
01:29:50,474 --> 01:29:51,462
Annie?

1083
01:29:53,310 --> 01:29:54,298
Annie?

1084
01:29:56,279 --> 01:29:58,144
No, please.

1085
01:30:03,153 --> 01:30:04,779
Now go have some fun.

1086
01:30:05,689 --> 01:30:06,747
Okay.

1087
01:30:07,123 --> 01:30:08,853
Annie?

1088
01:30:09,826 --> 01:30:11,885
- Annie! Aah! Aah! Aah!
- Oh, my God.

1089
01:30:12,095 --> 01:30:14,289
- No, baby!
- Oh, my God!

1090
01:30:16,867 --> 01:30:18,060
Mya, Mya, Mya!

1091
01:30:18,268 --> 01:30:19,496
I need you to calm down. Okay.

1092
01:30:19,703 --> 01:30:23,332
I need you to call 911.
Please? I need you to call 911.

1093
01:30:23,539 --> 01:30:25,006
Go! Go!

1094
01:30:26,777 --> 01:30:28,711
Oh, my God! Annie!

1095
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:32,074
Oh, my God, baby.

1096
01:30:32,314 --> 01:30:33,338
Fuck.

1097
01:30:40,957 --> 01:30:42,822
Baby.

1098
01:30:43,627 --> 01:30:45,287
Oh, my God.

1099
01:30:45,494 --> 01:30:47,520
There's a girl in the, um...

1100
01:30:47,730 --> 01:30:48,755
She's upstairs, she's...

1101
01:30:48,965 --> 01:30:52,365
I don't know... I don't know if she's okay.
She may be dead, but there's blood everywhere.

1102
01:30:52,569 --> 01:30:55,402
Stay with me.
Please stay with me. Please.

1103
01:30:55,604 --> 01:30:57,231
Please, I need you, okay?

1104
01:30:57,440 --> 01:30:59,466
Oh, my God.

1105
01:30:59,676 --> 01:31:01,837
Oh, my God,
I need you so much.

1106
01:31:02,045 --> 01:31:03,341
Baby, I'm so sorry.

1107
01:31:03,613 --> 01:31:05,171
Mya, hurry!

1108
01:31:05,381 --> 01:31:07,815
I don't know. I'm on Cherrywood
Road, I'm not at home.

1109
01:31:08,018 --> 01:31:10,042
I'm at... Maybe it's
avenue, uh... Hold on.

1110
01:31:10,252 --> 01:31:12,846
Stay on the line.
It's Cherrywood, I know that.

1111
01:31:13,289 --> 01:31:17,020
It's... We're at 1-5...
We're at 15 Cherry...

1112
01:31:21,530 --> 01:31:22,520
Mya?

1113
01:31:33,176 --> 01:31:34,643
Mya, what's happening?!

1114
01:31:54,730 --> 01:31:56,994
It is him. Please go.

1115
01:31:58,033 --> 01:31:59,159
I'm not leaving you.

1116
01:31:59,368 --> 01:32:00,734
Baby, I'm gonna put you down.

1117
01:32:00,936 --> 01:32:02,301
No, no.
- I'm gonna put you down.

1118
01:32:02,572 --> 01:32:03,595
No.

1119
01:32:05,574 --> 01:32:07,132
Okay.

1120
01:32:08,345 --> 01:32:10,438
Okay. Hold on,
baby, hold on.

1121
01:32:11,381 --> 01:32:14,213
You know, Annie's gonna smell
this on my clothes and kill me.

1122
01:32:14,783 --> 01:32:16,182
Sheriff Brackett.

1123
01:32:16,386 --> 01:32:17,876
I just got a 911 phone call.

1124
01:32:18,220 --> 01:32:21,679
- So did you dispatch?
- Yes, sir, I did.

1125
01:32:21,891 --> 01:32:24,292
- So why are you telling me about it?
- Because, sir,

1126
01:32:24,493 --> 01:32:26,894
the phone call
came from your house.

1127
01:32:27,963 --> 01:32:28,953
No.

1128
01:32:29,166 --> 01:32:30,257
Please, baby, please.

1129
01:32:30,466 --> 01:32:33,128
- I'm gonna stay right here.
- It's okay.

1130
01:32:33,336 --> 01:32:34,927
No, baby, no.
I'm not leaving you.

1131
01:32:35,137 --> 01:32:38,470
It's okay. Go.
- No, I'm not gonna leave you.

1132
01:32:38,675 --> 01:32:40,666
Baby? Baby? Baby?

1133
01:32:42,078 --> 01:32:43,067
Annie?

1134
01:32:43,279 --> 01:32:45,042
Annie? Stay with me.

1135
01:32:45,247 --> 01:32:48,706
Stay with me. Stay with me,
baby. Stay with me, okay?

1136
01:32:48,918 --> 01:32:51,887
You gotta stay with me.
You gotta.

1137
01:32:52,087 --> 01:32:53,918
Annie, stay with me.

1138
01:32:57,894 --> 01:32:59,725
Annie?

1139
01:33:00,564 --> 01:33:03,192
Annie? Annie?

1140
01:33:14,810 --> 01:33:16,368
Annie?

1141
01:33:29,525 --> 01:33:32,586
Don't leave me, baby.

1142
01:33:48,511 --> 01:33:49,500
Annie.

1143
01:34:46,002 --> 01:34:48,265
Please, sheriff, you don't wanna go
in there. L... Let me handle this.

1144
01:34:48,470 --> 01:34:50,336
Where is she?

1145
01:34:50,539 --> 01:34:52,667
You don't wanna go in there,
sheriff.

1146
01:34:56,412 --> 01:34:57,903
No.

1147
01:34:59,948 --> 01:35:01,677
Oh, God.

1148
01:35:05,622 --> 01:35:07,920
Oh, no. Annie.

1149
01:35:09,059 --> 01:35:11,253
Annie! God, no.

1150
01:35:11,461 --> 01:35:13,429
God, please.

1151
01:35:13,662 --> 01:35:16,496
Oh, God. No!

1152
01:35:17,266 --> 01:35:18,927
No!

1153
01:36:57,634 --> 01:36:59,192
Stop!

1154
01:36:59,402 --> 01:37:01,198
Stop, please!

1155
01:37:01,404 --> 01:37:03,462
Please stop!

1156
01:37:03,672 --> 01:37:05,833
Stop! Please!

1157
01:37:06,042 --> 01:37:07,372
Stop!

1158
01:37:10,279 --> 01:37:13,943
Please!
Please stop!

1159
01:37:14,384 --> 01:37:15,783
Stop, please!

1160
01:37:15,984 --> 01:37:17,577
Stop!

1161
01:37:20,088 --> 01:37:21,818
Stop!

1162
01:37:34,770 --> 01:37:36,295
Stop.

1163
01:37:36,706 --> 01:37:39,903
Please stop. Stop, please.

1164
01:37:42,244 --> 01:37:44,007
Stop.

1165
01:37:46,181 --> 01:37:47,739
Hey.

1166
01:37:48,283 --> 01:37:49,807
Hey.

1167
01:37:50,420 --> 01:37:52,512
- Are you okay?
- He's coming. Please.

1168
01:37:52,721 --> 01:37:54,952
- He's coming. He's coming.
- No one's coming.

1169
01:37:55,824 --> 01:37:57,417
- It's okay.
- He's... He's gonna kill me.

1170
01:37:57,627 --> 01:37:58,992
- Please!
- It's okay.

1171
01:37:59,194 --> 01:38:00,627
I gotta take you
to a hospital, okay?

1172
01:38:00,829 --> 01:38:03,162
We're gonna go to a hospital,
and everything's okay.

1173
01:38:03,365 --> 01:38:05,993
It's okay. It's okay.

1174
01:38:06,569 --> 01:38:08,229
Hurry.
- It's okay.

1175
01:38:08,438 --> 01:38:11,770
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

1176
01:38:11,975 --> 01:38:14,569
You're all right. You're
all right. It's okay.

1177
01:39:53,475 --> 01:39:54,966
Chief.

1178
01:39:55,511 --> 01:39:57,376
We got another body
up on Eagle Road.

1179
01:39:57,779 --> 01:39:59,610
We got a witness.

1180
01:39:59,815 --> 01:40:03,809
She saw a large man carrying
a girl away from a crash.

1181
01:40:04,020 --> 01:40:07,386
The state police believe the perp
is barricaded inside of a shack

1182
01:40:07,590 --> 01:40:09,056
just north of the crash site.

1183
01:40:11,327 --> 01:40:12,315
Okay.

1184
01:40:12,662 --> 01:40:13,650
Want me to handle it?

1185
01:40:18,868 --> 01:40:21,268
- I think maybe you should drive.
- Yes, sir.

1186
01:40:23,271 --> 01:40:25,569
People, roll out.
Going to Eagle Road.

1187
01:40:26,341 --> 01:40:27,604
Who are you?

1188
01:40:32,649 --> 01:40:34,047
You know who I am, Angel.

1189
01:40:35,952 --> 01:40:37,317
Now,

1190
01:40:37,953 --> 01:40:39,784
repeat after me:

1191
01:40:40,622 --> 01:40:41,988
I love you, Mommy.

1192
01:40:44,327 --> 01:40:46,693
I love you, Mommy.

1193
01:40:49,765 --> 01:40:52,029
I love you, Mommy.

1194
01:40:55,438 --> 01:40:57,702
I love you, Mommy.

1195
01:40:58,341 --> 01:40:59,807
I love you, Mommy.

1196
01:41:00,275 --> 01:41:02,506
I love you, Mommy.

1197
01:41:02,811 --> 01:41:04,211
I love you, Mommy.

1198
01:41:04,413 --> 01:41:07,474
Mommy, I love you! Please!
Please don't!

1199
01:41:07,684 --> 01:41:10,413
Let me go! Let me go!

1200
01:41:32,074 --> 01:41:34,100
You are surrounded.

1201
01:41:34,342 --> 01:41:36,708
Come out with your hands up.

1202
01:41:36,912 --> 01:41:41,315
- Help! Help, please!
- I repeat.

1203
01:41:41,516 --> 01:41:43,451
You are surrounded.

1204
01:41:43,653 --> 01:41:46,850
- Come out with your hands up.
- Don't! Please!

1205
01:41:47,090 --> 01:41:51,019
<i>Treasury purchases today
to keep that 10-year yield below 3 percent.</i>

1206
01:41:51,226 --> 01:41:55,823
<i>That's a big issue. When stock traders start
talking about treasury yields, pay attention.</i>

1207
01:41:56,099 --> 01:41:58,658
You're an asshole.

1208
01:41:58,868 --> 01:42:00,130
<i>This is breaking news.</i>

1209
01:42:00,336 --> 01:42:02,462
<i>This is Chopper
2. I wanna take you below.</i>

1210
01:42:02,671 --> 01:42:06,005
<i>This situation is just incredible.
I can't believe what I'm reporting,</i>

1211
01:42:06,208 --> 01:42:11,043
<i>but a man who police believe to be
deceased serial killer Michael Myers</i>

1212
01:42:11,247 --> 01:42:14,944
<i>has taken a hostage,
now identified as Laurie Strode.</i>

1213
01:42:15,150 --> 01:42:17,914
<i>Miss Strode allegedly shot
and killed Myers herself</i>

1214
01:42:18,121 --> 01:42:20,180
<i>after being abducted
on Halloween night.</i>

1215
01:42:20,389 --> 01:42:23,824
<i>And as if this story couldn't get more
twisted, it was revealed earlier today...</i>

1216
01:42:24,025 --> 01:42:25,856
God, no.

1217
01:42:27,195 --> 01:42:29,186
Come out with your hands up.

1218
01:42:30,766 --> 01:42:33,030
You're surrounded.

1219
01:42:33,368 --> 01:42:34,926
Tell me you got a shot, Caleb.

1220
01:42:35,137 --> 01:42:37,935
- No, I can't get a clean shot.
- Damn it.

1221
01:42:38,140 --> 01:42:41,304
In the shack. You're surrounded.

1222
01:42:41,577 --> 01:42:43,373
There is no escape.

1223
01:42:43,578 --> 01:42:46,309
Come out with your hands up.

1224
01:42:47,783 --> 01:42:50,115
- Waste of fucking time.
- Chief.

1225
01:42:50,319 --> 01:42:51,786
No sniper has a clean shot.

1226
01:42:51,988 --> 01:42:55,354
Hey, hey, hey! Get this vehicle
out of here. Sir, get back in the car.

1227
01:42:55,557 --> 01:42:57,492
Hold this.
- Sheriff!

1228
01:42:58,795 --> 01:43:00,421
Sheriff.

1229
01:43:03,800 --> 01:43:04,858
Get up. Get up.

1230
01:43:06,269 --> 01:43:09,796
There's an innocent girl in there
I might have kept safe

1231
01:43:10,006 --> 01:43:14,443
but for your greedy
fucking book.

1232
01:43:14,644 --> 01:43:18,306
I wanna shoot you.
I wanna shoot you so bad.

1233
01:43:18,514 --> 01:43:21,608
I wanna shoot him.
I wanna shoot him!

1234
01:43:21,818 --> 01:43:23,911
- I wanna fucking shoot him!
- Sheriff, please.

1235
01:43:24,153 --> 01:43:26,917
You son of a bitch!
You don't deserve to live.

1236
01:43:27,489 --> 01:43:29,515
Please, I just

1237
01:43:29,725 --> 01:43:32,454
came here because
I wanted to help.

1238
01:43:33,195 --> 01:43:36,631
There is nothing
that you have to say

1239
01:43:36,832 --> 01:43:37,993
that I wanna hear.

1240
01:43:38,201 --> 01:43:39,862
Sheriff, please.

1241
01:43:40,069 --> 01:43:41,592
You must trust me.

1242
01:43:41,871 --> 01:43:44,100
Look, this is pointless.

1243
01:43:44,306 --> 01:43:47,332
Michael's never gonna respond
to hostage negotiations.

1244
01:43:48,211 --> 01:43:49,802
Get him the fuck out of here.

1245
01:43:50,011 --> 01:43:51,604
Listen, I can draw him out.

1246
01:43:51,814 --> 01:43:53,679
I can draw him out.
I need to do this.

1247
01:43:53,882 --> 01:43:56,113
- Please, let me do this.
- Get him the fuck out of here!

1248
01:43:56,319 --> 01:43:59,287
All right, all right, all right!
I can walk from here, okay.

1249
01:44:07,496 --> 01:44:08,757
Get out of there!

1250
01:44:09,832 --> 01:44:12,493
Sheriff! I owe you.

1251
01:44:12,702 --> 01:44:16,069
- I owe you this.
- Goddamn it!

1252
01:44:16,671 --> 01:44:19,731
- Stand down!
- Stand down!

1253
01:44:29,886 --> 01:44:31,353
Michael.

1254
01:44:35,457 --> 01:44:37,050
She...

1255
01:44:37,260 --> 01:44:39,728
needs to come with me.

1256
01:44:41,898 --> 01:44:44,162
- Come on.
- L... I can't.

1257
01:44:44,367 --> 01:44:46,766
He's holding me down.

1258
01:44:47,369 --> 01:44:48,802
What?

1259
01:44:49,171 --> 01:44:52,833
Listen to me, Laurie. There's
no one holding you down.

1260
01:44:53,074 --> 01:44:54,667
Let me go!

1261
01:44:55,243 --> 01:44:57,804
Listen to me, Laurie,
listen! Stop!

1262
01:44:58,146 --> 01:44:59,636
Let me go!

1263
01:44:59,916 --> 01:45:02,042
- Listen to me!
- Let go of me!

1264
01:45:02,618 --> 01:45:03,641
Stop it!

1265
01:45:03,886 --> 01:45:07,548
- Stop! It's all in your mind.
- No! No!

1266
01:45:07,756 --> 01:45:10,055
- It's all in your mind!
- Let me go!

1267
01:45:10,359 --> 01:45:11,985
- We are ready.
- Stop!

1268
01:45:12,662 --> 01:45:14,288
It is time, Michael.
- Stop!

1269
01:45:14,796 --> 01:45:16,094
- Take us home.
- Stop!

1270
01:45:17,132 --> 01:45:18,760
Stop!

1271
01:45:38,787 --> 01:45:40,846
Michael, for God in hell...

1272
01:45:41,423 --> 01:45:42,412
Die!

1273
01:45:48,163 --> 01:45:49,721
Now!

1274
01:47:27,630 --> 01:47:31,190
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!
