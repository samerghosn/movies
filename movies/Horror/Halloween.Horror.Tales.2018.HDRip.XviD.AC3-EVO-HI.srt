00:00:00,451 --> 00:00:03,117
(ominous music)

2
00:00:08,114 --> 00:00:11,031
(thunder rumbling)

3
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:15,702
(wind howling)

4
00:00:16,708 --> 00:00:19,208
(eerie music)

5
00:00:34,844 --> 00:00:37,011
(gasping)

6
00:00:38,292 --> 00:00:41,209
(thunder rumbling)

7
00:01:07,421 --> 00:01:10,337
(thunder rumbling)

8
00:01:22,222 --> 00:01:24,722
(eerie music)

9
00:01:36,347 --> 00:01:39,502
(thunder rumbling)

10
00:01:39,502 --> 00:01:42,502
(suspenseful music)

11
00:02:35,062 --> 00:02:38,062
(suspenseful music)

12
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,780
- [Radio Announcer] It has been confirmed

13
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,800
that it was an apparent homicide.

14
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,340
Sources also say the
residence was burglarized

15
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:03,090
with most notable items
stolen being a clown costume

16
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,219
and makeup kit.

17
00:03:04,219 --> 00:03:06,159
A neighbor is quoted as
saying the victim worked

18
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,120
as a clown at children's parties.

19
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,199
And finally, there is no
information at this time

20
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:12,129
as to whether there is
any connection between

21
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:15,210
this case and the escape
last week of a patient

22
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:17,340
at Orchid Wood Psychiatric Ward.

23
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,195
We now return you to your
regularly scheduled programing.

24
00:03:20,195 --> 00:03:22,862
(ominous music)

25
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:37,293
- I've lived in Barnum all my life.

26
00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:40,593
It's been my whole world, you might say.

27
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,889
Barnum can be a really nice place

28
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:46,973
but it also has a darker side.

29
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,332
Some strange things have
happened here over the years.

30
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:56,639
One such tale involves a
rather sinister character

31
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:01,639
masquerading as that most adored
of children's entertainers.

32
00:04:02,629 --> 00:04:03,802
A circus clown.

33
00:04:05,289 --> 00:04:07,819
Historically, clowns
have been a great source

34
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:09,479
of fun and amusement.

35
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:12,490
These zany court jesters have entertained

36
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:14,923
both royalty and commoners alike.

37
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,692
But clowns can have a dark side too.

38
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:23,963
In fact, some clowns
can be downright deadly.

39
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:28,660
Such is the case in a
sinister little story

40
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,413
called "Die Laughing."

41
00:04:32,281 --> 00:04:35,031
(menacing music)

42
00:04:58,175 --> 00:05:00,180
(phone ringing)

43
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,012
- Hello.

44
00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:04,603
Oh hi, babe, I was just
looking at your picture.

45
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:09,110
No, I don't know if I got the job.

46
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:12,629
Yeah, the interview went pretty well

47
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:14,279
but they didn't make me an offer.

48
00:05:15,589 --> 00:05:17,439
They just said they'd get back to me.

49
00:05:18,779 --> 00:05:20,533
It's all so frustrating, lately.

50
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:24,379
Don't worry about me,
though, I'll be all right.

51
00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:26,773
Things have to turn around
eventually, don't they?

52
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:30,699
Miss Rusa is just a mean old
bat is all it comes down to.

53
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:33,793
So how did your trip go?

54
00:05:35,659 --> 00:05:37,562
Are you going to be getting home today?

55
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,382
I can't wait to see you.

56
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:43,737
Well come by if it's not too late.

57
00:05:43,737 --> 00:05:46,404
(ominous music)

58
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:51,002
Okay.

59
00:05:52,069 --> 00:05:52,903
Love you.

60
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,692
Bye.

61
00:06:00,136 --> 00:06:02,386
(knocking)

62
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:07,129
Miss Rusa, what a pleasant surprise.

63
00:06:07,129 --> 00:06:08,819
- You can skip the niceties, sweetie.

64
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:10,920
Do you have the rent for me yet?

65
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,971
- No, not yet but I'll
have it for you real soon.

66
00:06:13,971 --> 00:06:15,959
I just need a little more time.

67
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,480
I'm between jobs right now.

68
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,339
- You know, there are other people

69
00:06:19,339 --> 00:06:20,810
I could rent this place to.

70
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:23,769
This is a good location and
I got people interested.

71
00:06:23,769 --> 00:06:24,920
I want my money,

72
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,470
otherwise you better start
looking for a new place.

73
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,839
Understood?

74
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:29,673
- Understood.

75
00:06:29,673 --> 00:06:31,769
- I better be hearing
from you soon, missy.

76
00:06:31,769 --> 00:06:32,603
- You will.

77
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,480
- I want these yards cleaned up good!

78
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,600
They're both a mess, understand?

79
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,792
- You got it, Miss Rusa.

80
00:06:51,792 --> 00:06:52,625
- Good.

81
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:55,019
For what I'm paying you
fellas, you better have it!

82
00:06:55,019 --> 00:06:56,829
It's highway robbery, if you ask me.

83
00:06:56,829 --> 00:06:58,740
- Don't worry, Miss Rusa,
you'll get your money's worth.

84
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:59,663
- I better.

85
00:07:04,089 --> 00:07:05,360
- What a grouch.

86
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,550
- You said it, Bill.

87
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,629
Well, I guess we better get to work.

88
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:09,463
- Yup.

89
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,858
(thunder rumbling)

90
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:21,233
- Hey, you!

91
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:23,144
What're you doing back there?

92
00:07:23,144 --> 00:07:25,812
(ominous music)

93
00:07:26,694 --> 00:07:27,768
You def?

94
00:07:27,768 --> 00:07:29,949
I said, what're you doing back there?

95
00:07:32,403 --> 00:07:35,153
(sinister music)

96
00:07:38,533 --> 00:07:40,367
Hey, get out of there!

97
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:48,923
- [Man] Hello?

98
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:51,120
Hello, anyone home?

99
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,470
- Yes.

100
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:53,377
- [Man] Just letting you know,

101
00:07:53,377 --> 00:07:55,576
we're gonna be out here
working on the yard.

102
00:09:04,605 --> 00:09:07,772
(car engine rumbling)

103
00:09:16,452 --> 00:09:19,684
(sinister music)

104
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,934
(giggling)

105
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:25,013
- Joe?

106
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,493
Hey, Joe, you still out here?

107
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:34,110
You better not have knocked off early.

108
00:09:39,529 --> 00:09:42,623
Miss Rusa will chew us out
if it's not finished today.

109
00:09:43,789 --> 00:09:45,052
And we need this job.

110
00:09:46,951 --> 00:09:49,618
(ominous music)

111
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,192
Joe!

112
00:10:05,409 --> 00:10:07,659
(groaning)

113
00:10:12,038 --> 00:10:13,736
(squelching)

114
00:10:13,736 --> 00:10:15,903
(gagging)

115
00:10:43,489 --> 00:10:46,405
(foreboding music)

116
00:11:30,729 --> 00:11:32,389
(screaming)

117
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:35,056
(ominous music)

118
00:11:43,665 --> 00:11:46,165
(eerie music)

119
00:11:50,013 --> 00:11:52,263
(giggling)

120
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:06,708
(suspenseful music)

121
00:12:13,177 --> 00:12:15,510
(chuckling)

122
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:24,780
(laughing)

123
00:12:38,786 --> 00:12:40,905
(groaning)

124
00:12:40,905 --> 00:12:43,905
(suspenseful music)

125
00:12:47,904 --> 00:12:48,738
- Johnny!

126
00:12:52,503 --> 00:12:53,336
- Run!

127
00:13:00,586 --> 00:13:03,586
(suspenseful music)

128
00:13:05,924 --> 00:13:07,048
- Miss Rusa!

129
00:13:07,048 --> 00:13:07,881
Miss Rusa!

130
00:13:12,948 --> 00:13:15,698
(menacing music)

131
00:13:23,383 --> 00:13:24,216
- No!

132
00:13:28,184 --> 00:13:30,216
(squelching)

133
00:13:30,216 --> 00:13:32,466
(giggling)

134
00:13:37,731 --> 00:13:39,981
(laughing)

135
00:13:41,469 --> 00:13:43,969
(eerie music)

136
00:13:47,931 --> 00:13:49,552
(groaning)

137
00:13:49,552 --> 00:13:51,802
(laughing)

138
00:14:01,544 --> 00:14:04,628
(suspenseful music)

139
00:14:36,514 --> 00:14:38,231
(gasping)

140
00:14:38,231 --> 00:14:41,231
(suspenseful music)

141
00:14:57,755 --> 00:15:00,755
(suspenseful music)

142
00:15:09,662 --> 00:15:12,328
(ominous music)

143
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:32,070
- Hey, Lisa, it's Shawn.

144
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:34,210
I have bad news.

145
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:36,373
I'm stuck on the side of the road.

146
00:15:37,309 --> 00:15:38,950
My car broke down.

147
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:40,753
I believe I'm on Route Two.

148
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,950
Could you do me a favor, though?

149
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:45,809
Could you call the
Williamsons and tell them

150
00:15:45,809 --> 00:15:47,330
I'll just be a little bit late?

151
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:49,299
I'm waiting for the tow truck.

152
00:15:49,299 --> 00:15:52,549
But make sure to tell them
that Buzbo will be there.

153
00:15:52,549 --> 00:15:53,383
All right.

154
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,202
Okay.

155
00:15:55,202 --> 00:15:56,549
All right, thank you.

156
00:16:09,292 --> 00:16:11,958
(ominous music)

157
00:16:35,907 --> 00:16:38,014
(groaning)

158
00:16:38,014 --> 00:16:41,014
(suspenseful music)

159
00:16:44,309 --> 00:16:45,957
(groaning)

160
00:16:45,957 --> 00:16:49,061
(squelching)

161
00:16:49,061 --> 00:16:51,219
(yelling)

162
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:53,635
(whimpering)

163
00:16:58,307 --> 00:17:00,974
(ominous music)

164
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:08,808
(birds chirping)

165
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:29,440
(eerie music)

166
00:17:32,494 --> 00:17:33,327
- Oh!

167
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:37,272
(crying)

168
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:50,492
- [Man On TV] Let me guess,
wild turkey on the rocks?

169
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,859
- Well, no, I'll just
have a Shirley Temple.

170
00:17:53,859 --> 00:17:58,356
- [Man On TV] You know what
they say, if you don't drink--

171
00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:02,660
- People love movies.

172
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:05,190
They provides a voyeuristic escape

173
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:07,853
that just can't be found elsewhere.

174
00:18:09,009 --> 00:18:10,913
People love their movie stars too.

175
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:14,173
Especially those from the past.

176
00:18:15,099 --> 00:18:17,630
But it can all become too easy

177
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:21,170
to get wrapped up in cinematic fantasies.

178
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:23,829
That's the case in a twisted little tale

179
00:18:23,829 --> 00:18:25,492
called "The Horror Hostess."

180
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:30,306
(somber jazz music)

181
00:19:36,111 --> 00:19:37,720
(phone ringing)

182
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,619
(music muting)

183
00:19:39,619 --> 00:19:40,452
- Hello.

184
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:42,542
Oh hey!

185
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,369
Yeah, I'm getting ready now.

186
00:19:45,369 --> 00:19:47,650
I'll see you in about an hour.

187
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:49,559
Okay, thanks, bye.

188
00:19:51,365 --> 00:19:54,281
(faint jazz music)

189
00:19:57,634 --> 00:19:59,750
- Just a few more spots.

190
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:00,903
- Sure thing, hun.

191
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,869
- I can't tell you how much

192
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:05,440
I appreciate this opportunity, Jeana.

193
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,900
It means so much to me.

194
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,154
- Oh, it's my pleasure.

195
00:20:09,154 --> 00:20:13,053
I only wish I could pay you a
proper makeup artist salary.

196
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:16,240
You do good work, Katie.

197
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,400
- Thanks.

198
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,869
I really mean it.

199
00:20:18,869 --> 00:20:20,920
Just to get a foot in the door.

200
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,619
I love the horror genre.

201
00:20:22,619 --> 00:20:24,875
- Well that makes two of us.

202
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:27,000
(faint jazz music)

203
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,123
- So cool, even just to
be a small part of it.

204
00:20:31,325 --> 00:20:33,230
There you go, all done.

205
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:34,063
- Great.

206
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:36,859
- Oh, I gotta get to class.

207
00:20:36,859 --> 00:20:38,650
I gotta be there in 20 minutes.

208
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,119
Good luck with the show today

209
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:42,319
and I hope you have a
really exciting interview.

210
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:43,519
- Oh, thank you so much.

211
00:20:47,531 --> 00:20:50,431
(door closing)

212
00:20:50,431 --> 00:20:53,789
(crickets chirping)

213
00:20:53,789 --> 00:20:56,539
(menacing music)

214
00:21:18,487 --> 00:21:21,153
(ominous music)

215
00:21:40,452 --> 00:21:43,869
(suspenseful beat music)

216
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:38,470
(eerie music)

217
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,646
(gasping)

218
00:22:49,545 --> 00:22:52,961
(suspenseful beat music)

219
00:23:16,112 --> 00:23:18,278
(panting)

220
00:23:19,673 --> 00:23:22,816
(foreboding music)

221
00:23:22,816 --> 00:23:27,816
(electrical fizzling)
(alarm buzzing)

222
00:23:37,233 --> 00:23:39,901
(ominous music)

223
00:23:46,773 --> 00:23:49,941
(electrical fizzling)

224
00:23:51,172 --> 00:23:54,588
(suspenseful beat music)

225
00:24:20,976 --> 00:24:23,643
(door creaking)

226
00:24:39,339 --> 00:24:41,507
(gasping)

227
00:24:43,874 --> 00:24:46,624
(menacing music)

228
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,047
(panting)

229
00:25:20,795 --> 00:25:22,961
(panting)

230
00:25:32,829 --> 00:25:35,579
(sinister music)

231
00:25:37,313 --> 00:25:39,645
(screaming)

232
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,281
(swishing)

233
00:25:45,281 --> 00:25:46,482
- And there you have it.

234
00:25:46,482 --> 00:25:48,609
That was a scene from "Technopath,"

235
00:25:48,609 --> 00:25:50,990
the new stalker movie
starring tonight's guest

236
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:52,210
at the Horror Pad,

237
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:54,619
scream queen extraordinaire,

238
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:56,393
Rebecca Blaze!

239
00:25:58,809 --> 00:26:01,019
So how are you doing tonight, Rebecca?

240
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:01,853
- Excellent.

241
00:26:01,853 --> 00:26:03,400
Thanks for having me on the show, Jeana.

242
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,390
- Oh, that clip was so exciting.

243
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:09,099
Tell us a little more about "Technopath."

244
00:26:09,099 --> 00:26:11,480
- Oh, it's a cool little slasher movie

245
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:15,853
about a psychotic maniac
stalking young coeds.

246
00:26:15,853 --> 00:26:18,759
Great special effects, great cast.

247
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:21,900
The fans are going to love it.

248
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,450
- Well you certainly have become

249
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:26,819
a real fan favorite in the genre.

250
00:26:26,819 --> 00:26:29,569
Horror has been good to you, hasn't it?

251
00:26:29,569 --> 00:26:31,452
- Oh yes, it has.

252
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:35,380
The fans are amazing.

253
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:38,099
I don't know where I
would be without them.

254
00:26:38,099 --> 00:26:40,073
I do it all for the fans.

255
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:44,190
- Well, right now, we have another treat

256
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:46,410
for all you fright fans out there,

257
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:50,069
a clip from the indie horror
flick, "Blood Carousel,"

258
00:26:50,069 --> 00:26:53,839
starring my extra special
guest, Rebecca Blaze!

259
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:54,992
Enjoy!

260
00:26:56,289 --> 00:26:57,692
- And we're out.

261
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:03,480
- Thanks again for doing the show.

262
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,640
- Of course.

263
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,940
- We have just a couple more
questions after the clip

264
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,059
and that will be it.

265
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:08,930
- Cool.

266
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:09,762
- Although,

267
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:14,079
if you could hang around
for awhile after the taping,

268
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:16,450
I'd love to pick your brain some more.

269
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:17,750
- Sure, why not?

270
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:18,583
- Oh, great.

271
00:27:19,682 --> 00:27:22,182
(eerie music)

272
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:30,692
Care for a refill, hun?

273
00:27:30,692 --> 00:27:31,525
- Sure.

274
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:43,917
- To the horror genre.

275
00:27:43,917 --> 00:27:46,585
(ominous music)

276
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:56,052
I love classic horror
from back in the day.

277
00:27:57,549 --> 00:28:00,803
Those fright film stars were great.

278
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,482
Such elegant men and women.

279
00:28:05,914 --> 00:28:09,440
They exuded and amazing onscreen radiance

280
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,150
which gave the genre
that intangible quality

281
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:15,573
that can't be found anywhere else.

282
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,609
Of course, today's cinema is great too.

283
00:28:19,609 --> 00:28:23,692
I mean, I can't wait to see
"Technopath" in its entirety.

284
00:28:23,692 --> 00:28:25,173
(chuckling)

285
00:28:25,173 --> 00:28:27,817
- Well between you and me,

286
00:28:27,817 --> 00:28:30,502
it's actually pretty stupid.

287
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,089
(laughing)

288
00:28:33,089 --> 00:28:38,047
I just run around and
scream and show some skin.

289
00:28:38,047 --> 00:28:39,480
(laughing)

290
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,351
It's just your standard T and A flick.

291
00:28:42,351 --> 00:28:45,853
But it should be enough
to impress the simpletons.

292
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:48,353
- Simpletons?

293
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:50,990
- Yeah, you know.

294
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:52,363
My fans.

295
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:57,280
- But you said you owed it all to them.

296
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,359
(laughing)

297
00:28:58,359 --> 00:28:59,222
- I do.

298
00:29:00,609 --> 00:29:04,079
They're the ones that
keep buying the crap.

299
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:06,789
(laughing)

300
00:29:06,789 --> 00:29:09,009
- Care for another drink, hun?

301
00:29:09,009 --> 00:29:11,027
(giggling)

302
00:29:11,027 --> 00:29:13,693
(ominous music)

303
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:18,523
- Hey.

304
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:20,349
I was drinking that.

305
00:29:20,349 --> 00:29:23,133
- I think you've had
quite enough, young lady.

306
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:29,190
You know, if there's
one thing I can't stand,

307
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:31,130
it's a phony.

308
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:32,400
- What?

309
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,660
- A phony.

310
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:36,109
Someone who pretends to be one thing,

311
00:29:36,109 --> 00:29:39,690
but in reality is the exact opposite.

312
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:42,509
- Who are you calling a phony?

313
00:29:42,509 --> 00:29:44,480
- Why you, dear.

314
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,269
You have absolutely no
respect for the horror genre

315
00:29:48,269 --> 00:29:50,730
or its fans.

316
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:53,173
You should be ashamed of yourself.

317
00:29:56,339 --> 00:29:58,759
- Listen, bitch,

318
00:29:58,759 --> 00:30:03,353
I worked my ass off to get where I am.

319
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:06,670
I don't have to take any crap from any

320
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:08,960
low rent Elvira wannabe.

321
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,359
- Now, now, dear, temper, temper.

322
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:15,160
And no name-calling, young lady.

323
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,211
- That's it.

324
00:30:16,211 --> 00:30:17,730
I'm out of here.

325
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:22,940
- Oh, no, no, no, dear.

326
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:24,819
I can't let you leave.

327
00:30:24,819 --> 00:30:26,549
Not now.

328
00:30:26,549 --> 00:30:28,250
- What did you say?

329
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:32,819
- I said, I can't let you leave now.

330
00:30:32,819 --> 00:30:34,032
- Screw you, bitch!

331
00:30:36,397 --> 00:30:39,400
(ominous music)

332
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,586
What?

333
00:30:40,586 --> 00:30:41,747
- Well, hello gain.

334
00:30:41,747 --> 00:30:44,509
You know, I really love the horror genre

335
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:46,732
far too much to let you go.

336
00:30:47,635 --> 00:30:49,579
- What're you talking about?

337
00:30:49,579 --> 00:30:53,809
- Oh, you really wouldn't
understand, you silly little tart.

338
00:30:53,809 --> 00:30:56,859
It really is the purest art form,

339
00:30:56,859 --> 00:31:01,859
exploring the depths of fear,
terror and the human soul.

340
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:04,053
- You're crazy.

341
00:31:06,057 --> 00:31:08,099
(eerie music)

342
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:10,863
Bitch, you spiked my drink.

343
00:31:12,529 --> 00:31:15,359
- Now why would I do that?

344
00:31:16,282 --> 00:31:18,950
(ominous music)

345
00:31:23,435 --> 00:31:26,519
(heartbeat thumping)

346
00:31:29,767 --> 00:31:31,933
(gasping)

347
00:31:33,472 --> 00:31:36,454
(screaming)

348
00:31:36,454 --> 00:31:39,506
Now that's a real horror scream.

349
00:31:39,506 --> 00:31:41,588
Definitely your best yet.

350
00:31:42,695 --> 00:31:45,273
(ominous music)

351
00:31:45,273 --> 00:31:46,778
(yelping)

352
00:31:46,778 --> 00:31:49,194
(squelching)

353
00:31:50,401 --> 00:31:52,567
(gagging)

354
00:31:56,788 --> 00:31:59,288
(eerie music)

355
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:03,900
(growling)

356
00:32:06,053 --> 00:32:09,135
(heartbeat thumping)

357
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:17,733
(eerie music)

358
00:32:37,333 --> 00:32:39,742
(faint jazz music)

359
00:32:39,742 --> 00:32:42,569
- There you go, as gorgeous as always.

360
00:32:42,569 --> 00:32:44,022
- Oh, thank you, Katie.

361
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,240
- I gotta cruise.

362
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,740
- Oh, late for another class?

363
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:50,262
- I will be if I don't hurry.

364
00:32:51,925 --> 00:32:55,079
Hey, how'd that interview
go with that actress?

365
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:56,569
Rebecca Blaze.

366
00:32:56,569 --> 00:32:59,619
- Actually, she was quite a letdown.

367
00:32:59,619 --> 00:33:01,509
That woman just didn't have the passion

368
00:33:01,509 --> 00:33:02,759
that she should've had.

369
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:03,750
- That sucks.

370
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,210
- Yeah, it does.

371
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:07,109
But on the bright side,

372
00:33:07,109 --> 00:33:09,680
I came up with a whole new show intro.

373
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,349
It's a real scream.

374
00:33:11,349 --> 00:33:12,309
- Cool.

375
00:33:12,309 --> 00:33:13,730
Can't wait to see it.

376
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:15,499
I'll see you later.

377
00:33:15,499 --> 00:33:18,415
(faint jazz music)

378
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,660
(eerie music)

379
00:33:41,137 --> 00:33:43,471
(screaming)

380
00:33:46,669 --> 00:33:49,169
(eerie music)

381
00:33:53,549 --> 00:33:55,682
- Nature has a way of being evil.

382
00:33:56,599 --> 00:33:59,569
Take the Venus flytrap for example,

383
00:33:59,569 --> 00:34:01,823
where it devours its prey.

384
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,809
Man hasn't been kind to nature, though,

385
00:34:05,809 --> 00:34:08,599
with chemicals and what have you.

386
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:13,599
This time, nature strikes
back in a nasty way

387
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:16,306
in a story called, "The Bad Flower."

388
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:20,152
(somber music)

389
00:34:23,295 --> 00:34:26,045
(birds chirping)

390
00:34:49,052 --> 00:34:51,302
- There, that should do it.

391
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,650
Oh no.

392
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:54,682
What have I done?

393
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:58,690
I can't believe I mixed
Venus flytrap seeds

394
00:34:58,690 --> 00:34:59,739
with sunflower seeds.

395
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,983
Oh well, it won't harm anything.

396
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,068
(ominous music)

397
00:35:26,822 --> 00:35:29,989
(distant dog barking)

398
00:35:31,141 --> 00:35:33,891
(birds chirping)

399
00:35:36,378 --> 00:35:38,295
- Damn big ugly things.

400
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:41,690
Why anyone would want to
plant such a freaky thing

401
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:42,603
is beyond me.

402
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:49,684
Maybe they'd like a little
taste of my weed killer.

403
00:35:49,684 --> 00:35:52,351
(ominous music)

404
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,172
- What do you think you're doing?!

405
00:35:55,172 --> 00:35:56,762
You're killing my plants!

406
00:35:56,762 --> 00:35:57,876
Stop it!

407
00:35:57,876 --> 00:35:58,708
Stop it!

408
00:35:58,708 --> 00:36:00,420
- Get your hands off of me!

409
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:03,079
Those plants are blocking
the sunlight to my plants,

410
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:05,039
so they deserve to die!

411
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:06,960
Why do you grow such ugly things anyway?

412
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,519
- Those are my plants!

413
00:36:08,519 --> 00:36:10,280
You can't do this!

414
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:13,090
- As far as I'm concerned,
they are on my property

415
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:14,980
blocking the sun to my plants,

416
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:17,186
so back off!

417
00:36:17,186 --> 00:36:18,436
- I said, stop!

418
00:36:20,766 --> 00:36:22,688
- I warned you.

419
00:36:22,688 --> 00:36:24,347
(gasping)

420
00:36:24,347 --> 00:36:25,643
(whimpering)

421
00:36:25,643 --> 00:36:27,201
- How could you?

422
00:36:27,201 --> 00:36:28,367
How could you?

423
00:36:30,628 --> 00:36:34,041
- Maybe next time you'll
learn not to mess with me.

424
00:36:34,041 --> 00:36:36,942
And get rid of those
damn things before I do.

425
00:36:36,942 --> 00:36:39,025
(crying)

426
00:36:40,155 --> 00:36:42,467
(dramatic music)

427
00:36:42,467 --> 00:36:45,119
- I'm so sorry she hurt you.

428
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,733
I tried to stop her.

429
00:36:48,527 --> 00:36:49,360
She's so mean.

430
00:36:50,797 --> 00:36:53,242
I hope she gets what she deserves.

431
00:36:57,012 --> 00:36:59,762
(birds chirping)

432
00:37:13,668 --> 00:37:16,335
(ominous music)

433
00:37:24,896 --> 00:37:27,396
(eerie music)

434
00:37:49,253 --> 00:37:51,920
(ominous music)

435
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:05,358
(thunder rumbling)

436
00:38:08,849 --> 00:38:11,349
(eerie music)

437
00:38:19,911 --> 00:38:22,661
(menacing music)

438
00:38:24,262 --> 00:38:26,429
(gagging)

439
00:38:37,143 --> 00:38:39,875
(screaming)

440
00:38:39,875 --> 00:38:42,661
(ominous music)

441
00:38:42,661 --> 00:38:46,284
(leaves rustling)

442
00:38:46,284 --> 00:38:47,699
Oh no.

443
00:38:47,699 --> 00:38:50,210
My big sunflower's gone.

444
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:51,632
What happened to it?

445
00:38:58,590 --> 00:38:59,730
Thorn.

446
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:02,010
I should've guessed.

447
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:04,639
This time she's gone too far.

448
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:06,583
It's time I paid her a visit.

449
00:39:11,501 --> 00:39:14,273
- Carolyn?

450
00:39:14,273 --> 00:39:15,106
Carolyn?

451
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,291
Maybe she's in the garden.

452
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:21,125
Carolyn?

453
00:39:23,369 --> 00:39:24,452
Hey, Carolyn.

454
00:39:28,885 --> 00:39:31,552
(ominous music)

455
00:39:44,443 --> 00:39:46,943
(eerie music)

456
00:39:56,773 --> 00:39:59,523
(birds chirping)

457
00:40:06,614 --> 00:40:08,313
(screaming)

458
00:40:08,313 --> 00:40:11,393
(menacing music)

459
00:40:11,393 --> 00:40:14,393
(suspenseful music)

460
00:41:04,373 --> 00:41:07,039
(ominous music)

461
00:41:40,291 --> 00:41:43,291
(suspenseful music)

462
00:41:45,697 --> 00:41:47,947
(groaning)

463
00:41:50,099 --> 00:41:53,059
- Yes, I'm working on the
account right now, sir.

464
00:41:53,059 --> 00:41:55,300
I'll have it on your desk
first thing in the morning.

465
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,829
What's that?

466
00:41:56,829 --> 00:41:58,610
Oh yes, the changes have been made.

467
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:00,333
Just the way you ask for them.

468
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:02,632
Okay, sir, take care.

469
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:05,612
Jerk.

470
00:42:10,746 --> 00:42:13,576
(ominous music)

471
00:42:13,576 --> 00:42:16,242
(door clicking)

472
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:24,652
Hello?

473
00:42:41,489 --> 00:42:42,322
Hmm.

474
00:42:51,456 --> 00:42:53,045
Nah.

475
00:42:53,045 --> 00:42:55,378
I think it's time for a nap.

476
00:43:00,233 --> 00:43:02,900
(ominous music)

477
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:14,063
(leaves rustling)

478
00:43:21,541 --> 00:43:24,041
(eerie music)

479
00:43:39,036 --> 00:43:41,976
(gasping)

480
00:43:41,976 --> 00:43:43,501
(groaning)

481
00:43:43,501 --> 00:43:44,657
Plants!

482
00:43:44,657 --> 00:43:45,490
Plants!

483
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:48,007
(coughing)

484
00:43:48,007 --> 00:43:48,840
Help me!

485
00:43:50,083 --> 00:43:52,076
I can't breathe.

486
00:43:52,076 --> 00:43:53,943
(coughing)

487
00:43:53,943 --> 00:43:56,248
(menacing music)

488
00:43:56,248 --> 00:43:57,876
Choking!

489
00:43:57,876 --> 00:44:00,043
(gagging)

490
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:03,567
(ominous music)

491
00:44:06,032 --> 00:44:07,411
(thudding)

492
00:44:07,411 --> 00:44:08,248
(glass shattering)

493
00:44:08,248 --> 00:44:10,581
(screaming)

494
00:44:21,639 --> 00:44:24,139
(eerie music)

495
00:44:25,637 --> 00:44:27,719
- What the hell was that?

496
00:44:39,242 --> 00:44:40,876
A walking plant?

497
00:44:40,876 --> 00:44:43,376
(eerie music)

498
00:44:44,931 --> 00:44:46,632
Who's gonna believe me?

499
00:44:48,219 --> 00:44:50,563
No more stopping at the bar after work.

500
00:45:02,581 --> 00:45:05,248
(ominous music)

501
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:09,286
(suspenseful music)

502
00:45:12,199 --> 00:45:14,367
(gagging)

503
00:45:25,170 --> 00:45:26,003
No!

504
00:45:26,003 --> 00:45:26,836
No!

505
00:45:28,123 --> 00:45:29,572
(groaning)

506
00:45:29,572 --> 00:45:30,827
No.

507
00:45:30,827 --> 00:45:32,289
No!

508
00:45:32,289 --> 00:45:34,539
(groaning)

509
00:45:38,342 --> 00:45:40,592
(coughing)

510
00:45:44,583 --> 00:45:47,333
(birds chirping)

511
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:54,920
- Can't believe there have now been

512
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,679
four murders in this town.

513
00:45:56,679 --> 00:45:58,469
- And to think, the
first one was right here

514
00:45:58,469 --> 00:46:00,099
in my own backyard.

515
00:46:00,099 --> 00:46:01,840
It scares me.

516
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:03,869
- I know but you know as well as I do

517
00:46:03,869 --> 00:46:05,230
that Mrs. Thorn deserved it.

518
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:07,480
- Oh Cindy, even Mrs. Thorn

519
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:09,909
doesn't deserve to die like that.

520
00:46:09,909 --> 00:46:13,539
- After what that which did
to you, you're just too nice.

521
00:46:13,539 --> 00:46:15,489
- But those terrible murders.

522
00:46:15,489 --> 00:46:18,119
That poor guy playing basketball.

523
00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:19,929
I hope they catch the killer soon.

524
00:46:19,929 --> 00:46:21,659
I'm afraid to even come out here

525
00:46:21,659 --> 00:46:24,630
and sit in my own garden for very long.

526
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:25,800
- Speaking of your garden,

527
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:28,440
did you ever find that plant
that Mrs. Thorn ripped out?

528
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:30,588
- Oh, you mean my nice, big sunflower?

529
00:46:30,588 --> 00:46:32,530
No, I never saw it again.

530
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:34,980
- I remember when you
first started growing that.

531
00:46:36,969 --> 00:46:37,949
- What is it?

532
00:46:37,949 --> 00:46:39,085
Cindy, what's the matter?

533
00:46:39,085 --> 00:46:41,739
- That sunflower,

534
00:46:41,739 --> 00:46:43,420
I thought you said it was gone.

535
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:45,329
- It is gone, Cindy.

536
00:46:45,329 --> 00:46:46,820
- Turn around.

537
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:48,639
- Cindy, stop playing games.

538
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:49,603
- Turn around.

539
00:46:50,769 --> 00:46:52,655
- I don't believe it.

540
00:46:52,655 --> 00:46:55,322
(ominous music)

541
00:46:57,150 --> 00:46:58,483
I just don't believe it.

542
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:01,623
It's been gone.

543
00:47:03,139 --> 00:47:05,969
Now it looks like it
was never even dug up.

544
00:47:05,969 --> 00:47:08,320
- Maybe someone's trying
to play a joke on you.

545
00:47:09,969 --> 00:47:12,079
- But the only one who
would do something like that

546
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:15,003
is Mrs. Thorn and she's dead.

547
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:18,282
- I don't understand it.

548
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:27,769
- I have to go in for a
minute, do you want anything?

549
00:47:27,769 --> 00:47:29,480
- No thanks, I'm fine.

550
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,179
- Okay, I'll be right back.

551
00:47:32,353 --> 00:47:35,103
(birds chirping)

552
00:47:37,927 --> 00:47:40,594
(ominous music)

553
00:47:54,172 --> 00:47:57,172
(suspenseful music)

554
00:48:03,409 --> 00:48:06,242
(leaves rustling)

555
00:48:11,601 --> 00:48:13,851
(groaning)

556
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:19,351
(suspenseful music)

557
00:48:29,682 --> 00:48:32,349
(ominous music)

558
00:48:35,061 --> 00:48:37,311
(coughing)

559
00:48:39,045 --> 00:48:40,536
- Carolyn!

560
00:48:40,536 --> 00:48:41,664
Help!

561
00:48:41,664 --> 00:48:42,498
Carolyn!

562
00:48:45,663 --> 00:48:46,496
- Cindy?

563
00:48:47,572 --> 00:48:48,905
- Carolyn, help!

564
00:48:50,233 --> 00:48:51,431
Help!

565
00:48:51,431 --> 00:48:52,264
Carolyn!

566
00:48:53,771 --> 00:48:55,336
Carolyn, help!

567
00:48:55,336 --> 00:48:56,650
- Stop!
(screeching)

568
00:48:56,650 --> 00:48:58,637
Stop, you're killing her!

569
00:48:58,637 --> 00:49:01,304
(ominous music)

570
00:49:06,829 --> 00:49:08,960
(coughing)

571
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,489
Cindy, are you okay?

572
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:11,371
Are you all right?

573
00:49:11,371 --> 00:49:13,195
- I'll be okay.

574
00:49:13,195 --> 00:49:14,028
(gasping)

575
00:49:14,028 --> 00:49:14,862
- Oh no!

576
00:49:16,181 --> 00:49:18,010
(screeching)

577
00:49:18,010 --> 00:49:18,880
Your lighter!

578
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,300
Cindy, where's your lighter?

579
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:23,282
- It's in my purse, on the table!

580
00:49:25,376 --> 00:49:27,626
(coughing)

581
00:49:28,849 --> 00:49:30,599
- You want someone, take me!

582
00:49:30,599 --> 00:49:32,150
I'm right her, come and get me!

583
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:32,983
Take me!

584
00:49:35,268 --> 00:49:36,885
(growling)

585
00:49:36,885 --> 00:49:39,302
(screeching)

586
00:49:40,958 --> 00:49:43,708
(fire crackling)

587
00:49:44,706 --> 00:49:47,373
(plants crying)

588
00:49:52,019 --> 00:49:54,269
(growling)

589
00:49:58,135 --> 00:50:00,885
(fire crackling)

590
00:50:09,114 --> 00:50:11,864
(birds chirping)

591
00:50:16,275 --> 00:50:18,858
(somber music)

592
00:50:19,916 --> 00:50:21,710
- Our final story

593
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:24,532
brings us a series of brutal murders.

594
00:50:25,469 --> 00:50:28,909
A lethal hunter ravaging a small town

595
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,429
and a group of people

596
00:50:31,429 --> 00:50:34,550
headed for a blood-drenched encounter,

597
00:50:34,550 --> 00:50:37,010
all in a strange little tale

598
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:38,907
called, "The Hunt."

599
00:50:38,907 --> 00:50:41,489
(somber music)

600
00:50:42,724 --> 00:50:45,594
(suspenseful music)

601
00:50:45,594 --> 00:50:47,762
(gasping)

602
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:51,384
(crying)

603
00:50:54,371 --> 00:50:55,617
- [Man] Somebody!

604
00:50:55,617 --> 00:50:57,150
(snarling)

605
00:50:57,150 --> 00:50:58,150
- Elizabeth!

606
00:50:59,239 --> 00:51:01,989
(birds chirping)

607
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:16,940
(somber beat music)

608
00:51:47,429 --> 00:51:48,262
- Okay.

609
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:50,650
So now, Mr. Linden,

610
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:53,193
you claim not to have
seen anything at all.

611
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:55,159
- That's what I said.

612
00:51:57,039 --> 00:52:00,820
- And you're not sure that
you heard anything either.

613
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:02,373
- Nope, not sure.

614
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:05,862
- Mr. Linden, can I be frank with you?

615
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:08,079
Several other people,

616
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:10,690
farther away from where
the murders took place,

617
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:13,519
are positive they heard a
woman screaming for help

618
00:52:14,909 --> 00:52:16,530
and if that's the case,

619
00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:17,960
then it's hard to believe that a woman

620
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:19,583
screaming right outside your doorstep

621
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:21,492
didn't get your attention.

622
00:52:21,492 --> 00:52:24,317
- I told you, I ain't sure what I heard.

623
00:52:24,317 --> 00:52:27,594
Coulda been coyotes for all I knew.

624
00:52:27,594 --> 00:52:28,844
- Coyotes, huh?

625
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:32,969
There have been several
very brutal murders,

626
00:52:32,969 --> 00:52:36,079
all in close proximity to your place.

627
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:38,289
- The police already questioned me.

628
00:52:38,289 --> 00:52:40,789
They was here all day yesterday.

629
00:52:40,789 --> 00:52:42,836
- Well now I'm questioning you.

630
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:46,193
- I can't tell you nothing else.

631
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:51,630
- Okay.

632
00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:53,079
Then I guess we're done here.

633
00:53:06,590 --> 00:53:08,090
Something I can help you with?

634
00:53:09,195 --> 00:53:11,869
(ominous music)

635
00:53:11,869 --> 00:53:14,077
Can I help you with something?

636
00:53:31,387 --> 00:53:34,221
(engine rumbling)

637
00:53:43,523 --> 00:53:45,222
- Dang kids.

638
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:47,472
Always messing up property.

639
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:55,050
(siren alarming)

640
00:53:59,378 --> 00:54:02,568
(ominous music)

641
00:54:02,568 --> 00:54:05,568
(people chattering)

642
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:46,817
- The unholy beast must be laid to rest!

643
00:54:46,817 --> 00:54:48,860
(people gasping)

644
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:50,010
- Get them out of here.

645
00:54:50,869 --> 00:54:52,219
- Okay, folks, show's over.

646
00:54:52,219 --> 00:54:54,409
Let's move it back, please.

647
00:54:54,409 --> 00:54:57,077
(ominous music)

648
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:05,349
- Jimmy Rogers, Beacon Post.

649
00:55:05,349 --> 00:55:07,369
Is there any hard
evidence in the case yet?

650
00:55:07,369 --> 00:55:09,139
- I have no statement
to make at this time.

651
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:12,269
- Why has this investigation
been taken over by the FBI?

652
00:55:12,269 --> 00:55:14,210
And what about all the
reports about conflicts

653
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:15,679
with local law enforcement?

654
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:17,280
- I said I have no statement.

655
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,579
- And what about all the
talk about a monster?

656
00:55:20,713 --> 00:55:22,880
About a monster roaming the town?

657
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,360
How much longer do the people have to wait

658
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:26,193
before they get some answers?!

659
00:55:27,317 --> 00:55:29,983
(ominous music)

660
00:55:32,485 --> 00:55:35,235
(pleasant music)

661
00:55:37,724 --> 00:55:39,974
(rattling)

662
00:55:46,661 --> 00:55:48,911
(rattling)

663
00:55:51,188 --> 00:55:53,856
(spray hissing)

664
00:56:02,195 --> 00:56:03,867
- [Mr. Linden] You, get out of here!

665
00:56:03,867 --> 00:56:05,449
- Screw you, Cyrus!

666
00:56:17,844 --> 00:56:20,094
(knocking)

667
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:43,500
- So I take it there is
something I could help you with.

668
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:44,333
- Maybe.

669
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:47,670
- I must say, you got
here pretty fast on foot.

670
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:50,599
- I'm familiar with the area.

671
00:56:50,599 --> 00:56:52,250
I grew up around here.

672
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:55,639
- So what can I do for you, Mister?

673
00:56:55,639 --> 00:56:56,739
- Johnson.

674
00:56:56,739 --> 00:56:57,762
Darren Johnson.

675
00:56:58,889 --> 00:57:01,460
- What can I do for you, Mr. Johnson?

676
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:02,599
- You're the FBI agent

677
00:57:02,599 --> 00:57:05,030
investigating the murders
in town, aren't you?

678
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:06,202
- That's right.

679
00:57:06,202 --> 00:57:07,036
Leanna.

680
00:57:07,036 --> 00:57:07,869
Leanna Stark.

681
00:57:08,989 --> 00:57:10,090
What can I do for you?

682
00:57:11,007 --> 00:57:13,800
- Do you have any leads
to the killer's identity

683
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,342
or where they might be?

684
00:57:16,719 --> 00:57:19,510
- That's confidential, Mr. Johnson.

685
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:21,860
My investigation's ongoing.

686
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:23,652
Do you have any information for me?

687
00:57:24,909 --> 00:57:25,769
- No.

688
00:57:25,769 --> 00:57:28,670
It's just I don't think
it's a normal killer

689
00:57:28,670 --> 00:57:29,869
that we're dealing with.

690
00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:32,623
- What exactly does that mean?

691
00:57:33,519 --> 00:57:36,659
- Well, it may not be something
that you're expecting.

692
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:41,719
- Mr. Johnson, do you
watch the local news a lot?

693
00:57:41,719 --> 00:57:43,920
- Yeah, as much as the
next person, I guess.

694
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:48,927
- My guess is a little
more than the next person.

695
00:57:48,927 --> 00:57:51,853
"It" may not be "something" I'm expecting?

696
00:57:53,010 --> 00:57:55,590
Your local reporters and
the townsfolk around here

697
00:57:55,590 --> 00:57:57,889
have some wild imagination

698
00:57:57,889 --> 00:58:00,869
and if you're here to feed
me more of that vampire crap,

699
00:58:00,869 --> 00:58:02,320
you can save it.

700
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:05,320
- You might be better off keeping
an open mind about things.

701
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:07,710
- I might be better off
getting a good night sleep

702
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:10,900
before I file a long and
tedious report with the bureau

703
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:12,320
and then I'll be better off finding out

704
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:14,349
who is committing these sick murders.

705
00:58:14,349 --> 00:58:15,670
And then I might be better off

706
00:58:15,670 --> 00:58:17,713
getting out of this dead end town!

707
00:58:18,619 --> 00:58:20,539
Now I'm gonna ask you again,

708
00:58:20,539 --> 00:58:22,588
do you have anything to share?

709
00:58:22,588 --> 00:58:23,510
- No.

710
00:58:23,510 --> 00:58:24,483
Nothing to share.

711
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,353
- Stupid hicks.

712
00:58:35,643 --> 00:58:38,309
(spray hissing)

713
00:58:45,284 --> 00:58:47,840
(ominous music)

714
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:48,983
- Hey, who's there?

715
00:58:50,521 --> 00:58:53,271
(birds chirping)

716
00:58:55,409 --> 00:58:57,143
I said, who's there?

717
00:58:58,170 --> 00:59:00,838
(ominous music)

718
00:59:06,947 --> 00:59:07,780
(gasping)

719
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:09,295
(growling)

720
00:59:09,295 --> 00:59:12,045
(girl screaming)

721
00:59:14,199 --> 00:59:16,429
- [Darren] Don't play games
with me, I'm warning you!

722
00:59:16,429 --> 00:59:17,619
You better tell me, or else!

723
00:59:17,619 --> 00:59:18,780
- [Cyrus] You're crazy!

724
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:19,612
Get out of here!

725
00:59:19,612 --> 00:59:22,289
- You better start talking
or you'll be sorry!

726
00:59:22,289 --> 00:59:24,789
You know where she is and
you're going to tell me!

727
00:59:25,992 --> 00:59:28,280
- I don't know what you're talking about.

728
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:29,163
- You lie!

729
00:59:30,070 --> 00:59:31,929
- Get out of here before
I call the police.

730
00:59:31,929 --> 00:59:33,440
- You're hiding that woman.

731
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:34,639
That thing.

732
00:59:34,639 --> 00:59:35,940
- I said get out of here.

733
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:37,800
- I know how to deal with it.

734
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:38,650
- She'd kill you.

735
00:59:38,650 --> 00:59:39,603
She'd kill us both.

736
00:59:40,530 --> 00:59:42,840
- What's the problem here, gentlemen?

737
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:44,972
Mr. Johnson, drop the piece of wood.

738
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:49,119
Now I'm gonna wanna word with you.

739
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:51,650
Mr. Linden, stay where you are

740
00:59:51,650 --> 00:59:53,949
because I'm gonna wanna
word with you as well.

741
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:57,733
Have a seat.

742
01:00:03,826 --> 01:00:06,289
Did you knock Mr. Linden to the ground?

743
01:00:06,289 --> 01:00:07,219
- I might have.

744
01:00:07,219 --> 01:00:09,510
We were having a discussion.

745
01:00:09,510 --> 01:00:10,980
- A discussion?

746
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:13,030
Looked more like a heated argument to me.

747
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:17,969
If I catch you assaulting Mr. Linden,

748
01:00:17,969 --> 01:00:19,960
or anyone else for that matter,

749
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:22,150
I will cuff you on the spot.

750
01:00:22,150 --> 01:00:23,829
Is that clear?

751
01:00:23,829 --> 01:00:24,663
- Yes.

752
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:26,949
- Good.

753
01:00:26,949 --> 01:00:28,336
Now what's with the wooden stake?

754
01:00:28,336 --> 01:00:30,920
- You must know the answer to that by now.

755
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:33,139
- Oh yes, I forgot.

756
01:00:33,139 --> 01:00:35,880
You think the killer's a vampire

757
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:37,400
and let me guess,

758
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:40,409
you're here to kill it
with a wooden stake.

759
01:00:40,409 --> 01:00:41,920
- I don't care if you believe me or not.

760
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:43,559
I know the truth.

761
01:00:43,559 --> 01:00:45,010
- I seriously suggest

762
01:00:45,010 --> 01:00:47,909
that you don't go waving
those things around at people.

763
01:00:47,909 --> 01:00:49,682
It might be bad for your health.

764
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:52,003
Now, Mr. Linden,

765
01:00:53,070 --> 01:00:55,070
have you got something to share with me?

766
01:00:57,469 --> 01:00:59,329
- It's Camille.

767
01:00:59,329 --> 01:01:00,293
She's the one.

768
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:03,059
- Camille?

769
01:01:03,059 --> 01:01:04,719
The one who's committing all these murders

770
01:01:04,719 --> 01:01:07,059
is a woman named Camille?

771
01:01:07,059 --> 01:01:09,523
- No, not a woman.

772
01:01:10,829 --> 01:01:12,019
- You too?

773
01:01:12,019 --> 01:01:13,769
You're gonna feed me this crap too?

774
01:01:14,739 --> 01:01:15,713
- It ain't crap.

775
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:19,110
- All right, Mr. Linden,

776
01:01:19,110 --> 01:01:20,460
why don't you enlighten me?

777
01:01:22,670 --> 01:01:26,239
- One morning, close to sunrise,

778
01:01:26,239 --> 01:01:28,382
I heard a rapping at my back door.

779
01:01:29,242 --> 01:01:31,492
(knocking)

780
01:01:32,429 --> 01:01:34,034
There she was.

781
01:01:34,034 --> 01:01:38,077
This woman with a blanket thrown over her.

782
01:01:38,077 --> 01:01:40,583
Her face just peeking out from under it.

783
01:01:41,655 --> 01:01:43,590
(somber music)

784
01:01:43,590 --> 01:01:45,619
She looked nervous.

785
01:01:45,619 --> 01:01:47,909
Like someone was after her.

786
01:01:47,909 --> 01:01:49,380
Kept looking up at the sky

787
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:51,967
as if something was
gonna fall down on her.

788
01:01:54,889 --> 01:01:56,500
She said she needed help.

789
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:58,289
I asked her what's wrong

790
01:01:58,289 --> 01:01:59,699
but she wouldn't say.

791
01:01:59,699 --> 01:02:01,409
So I said, "Come in."

792
01:02:01,409 --> 01:02:06,210
But she hesitated and asked
me if she was invited.

793
01:02:06,210 --> 01:02:08,076
I didn't think nothing of it.

794
01:02:08,076 --> 01:02:11,503
Just said, yes, she's
invited and brought her in.

795
01:02:14,869 --> 01:02:18,389
She said she was traveling
by foot around the country

796
01:02:19,550 --> 01:02:21,972
and needed a place to stay for a few days.

797
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:25,393
Anyway,

798
01:02:27,130 --> 01:02:29,019
nothing happened that day.

799
01:02:29,019 --> 01:02:31,440
She stayed in the spare room

800
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:34,802
with the shades drawn and the door locked.

801
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:37,583
I thought she was just tired.

802
01:02:39,239 --> 01:02:44,202
The next night, I heard a scream
not too far from the house.

803
01:02:44,202 --> 01:02:46,891
(eerie music)

804
01:02:46,891 --> 01:02:48,190
And I went outside

805
01:02:48,190 --> 01:02:50,246
and through the graveyard.

806
01:02:56,336 --> 01:02:58,836
(eerie music)

807
01:03:02,981 --> 01:03:04,987
(squelching)

808
01:03:04,987 --> 01:03:07,500
And that's when I saw her,

809
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:10,170
feeding on that first hiker.

810
01:03:10,170 --> 01:03:12,503
(crunching)

811
01:03:15,050 --> 01:03:16,760
There was blood everywhere.

812
01:03:20,981 --> 01:03:23,148
(hissing)

813
01:03:27,043 --> 01:03:30,289
And that's when she saw me watching.

814
01:03:30,289 --> 01:03:33,909
She said she'd do the same
to me if I said anything.

815
01:03:33,909 --> 01:03:36,269
I said nothing to nobody.

816
01:03:36,269 --> 01:03:39,983
Since then, she's been hiding
out in my old tool shed.

817
01:03:41,019 --> 01:03:42,719
I guess she likes it better there.

818
01:03:45,085 --> 01:03:47,380
I kept hoping she'd leave,

819
01:03:47,380 --> 01:03:48,992
go to some other town.

820
01:03:53,239 --> 01:03:54,840
- He should he help responsible!

821
01:03:56,639 --> 01:03:57,480
- Why don't you take me out

822
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:59,420
to this shed of yours, Mr. Linden?

823
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:00,650
- No.

824
01:04:00,650 --> 01:04:02,150
- I'll make him take us out there!

825
01:04:02,150 --> 01:04:03,237
- Stay out of this!

826
01:04:03,237 --> 01:04:04,282
- I can't!

827
01:04:04,282 --> 01:04:05,525
She'll kill me!

828
01:04:05,525 --> 01:04:06,358
She'll kill me!

829
01:04:06,358 --> 01:04:07,949
- Don't even think about following me!

830
01:04:09,257 --> 01:04:12,257
(suspenseful music)

831
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:30,670
- Get out of here!

832
01:04:30,670 --> 01:04:32,012
Leave it alone!

833
01:04:32,012 --> 01:04:34,452
- Drop the gun, Mr. Liden, now!

834
01:04:34,452 --> 01:04:36,445
(gunshot booming)

835
01:04:36,445 --> 01:04:38,612
(booming)

836
01:04:53,496 --> 01:04:55,739
(ominous music)

837
01:04:55,739 --> 01:04:57,989
(thudding)

838
01:05:03,269 --> 01:05:06,186
(foreboding music)

839
01:05:27,855 --> 01:05:30,938
(ominous beat music)

840
01:05:58,523 --> 01:06:01,523
(crickets chirping)

841
01:06:10,268 --> 01:06:12,518
(growling)

842
01:06:29,132 --> 01:06:32,132
(suspenseful music)

843
01:06:34,579 --> 01:06:36,126
- Hello?

844
01:06:36,126 --> 01:06:38,793
(ominous music)

845
01:07:01,795 --> 01:07:03,961
(hissing)

846
01:07:05,041 --> 01:07:07,326
(yelling)

847
01:07:07,326 --> 01:07:10,326
(suspenseful music)

848
01:07:11,659 --> 01:07:14,110
(crying)

849
01:07:14,110 --> 01:07:16,527
(squelching)

850
01:07:17,802 --> 01:07:19,969
(gasping)

851
01:07:29,858 --> 01:07:30,713
(hissing)

852
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:32,880
(yelling)

853
01:07:35,632 --> 01:07:36,632
- Elizabeth!

854
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:43,710
(dramatic music)

855
01:07:51,141 --> 01:07:52,307
Elizabeth, no!

856
01:07:55,449 --> 01:07:57,050
Elizabeth!

857
01:07:57,050 --> 01:07:58,340
Elizabeth!

858
01:07:58,340 --> 01:07:59,590
Come on, come on!

859
01:07:59,590 --> 01:08:00,643
Elizabeth, come on.

860
01:08:01,847 --> 01:08:03,268
Somebody.

861
01:08:03,268 --> 01:08:05,934
(ominous music)

862
01:08:24,123 --> 01:08:27,041
(foreboding music)

863
01:08:32,301 --> 01:08:33,847
- Drop the wood.

864
01:08:33,847 --> 01:08:35,715
- She killed my wife!

865
01:08:35,715 --> 01:08:37,220
(gunshots booming)

866
01:08:37,220 --> 01:08:39,421
(menacing music)

867
01:08:39,421 --> 01:08:41,204
(hissing)

868
01:08:41,204 --> 01:08:42,375
(booming)

869
01:08:42,375 --> 01:08:44,283
(hissing)

870
01:08:44,283 --> 01:08:47,283
(suspenseful music)

871
01:08:53,688 --> 01:08:56,202
(booming)

872
01:08:56,202 --> 01:08:58,368
(hissing)

873
01:09:06,233 --> 01:09:07,815
- Well look at you.

874
01:09:09,185 --> 01:09:12,069
And I thought vampires were nonsense.

875
01:09:12,069 --> 01:09:13,393
Just a bunch of crap.

876
01:09:14,489 --> 01:09:15,592
Here you are.

877
01:09:16,460 --> 01:09:17,323
In the flesh.

878
01:09:19,229 --> 01:09:22,229
You've certainly done a number
on these people, haven't you?

879
01:09:23,313 --> 01:09:25,840
And now you're gonna do something for me.

880
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:27,252
You're gonna help me out.

881
01:09:30,216 --> 01:09:31,289
(gunshot booming)
(hissing)

882
01:09:31,289 --> 01:09:32,703
Wrong answer, bitch!

883
01:09:33,890 --> 01:09:36,159
See, I've got lots of ammo

884
01:09:36,159 --> 01:09:38,649
and though I may not be able to kill you,

885
01:09:38,649 --> 01:09:41,832
I can torture you all night long.

886
01:09:43,229 --> 01:09:45,542
Are you ready to listen
to what I have to say?

887
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:49,592
I'll take your silence as a yes.

888
01:09:51,979 --> 01:09:53,380
I want out of this rat race.

889
01:09:56,750 --> 01:09:58,733
People think my life is exciting,

890
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:01,222
like on TV.

891
01:10:02,819 --> 01:10:04,162
Think again, sister.

892
01:10:05,979 --> 01:10:08,162
My life is going through the motions.

893
01:10:09,489 --> 01:10:11,510
Long hours,

894
01:10:11,510 --> 01:10:13,579
no recognition,

895
01:10:13,579 --> 01:10:15,710
lonely nights,

896
01:10:15,710 --> 01:10:18,239
ex-husbands that don't
wanna pay child support

897
01:10:18,239 --> 01:10:19,502
when they're supposed to.

898
01:10:20,859 --> 01:10:22,162
That's my life.

899
01:10:24,170 --> 01:10:27,479
But not anymore because here you are

900
01:10:28,498 --> 01:10:30,498
and you're gonna get rid of that for me.

901
01:10:31,369 --> 01:10:33,539
You're gonna take away the pain

902
01:10:33,539 --> 01:10:36,279
and I'm gonna have total freedom,

903
01:10:36,279 --> 01:10:37,680
just like

904
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:38,514
you!

905
01:10:41,409 --> 01:10:42,243
Now,

906
01:10:45,119 --> 01:10:46,340
are you gonna play ball

907
01:10:47,238 --> 01:10:50,103
or do I have to fire off another shot?

908
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:54,162
Easy now.

909
01:10:56,199 --> 01:10:58,149
I hope you've got a good bedside manner

910
01:10:59,409 --> 01:11:02,342
because if I feel more
than a few pin pricks,

911
01:11:04,369 --> 01:11:06,119
I'm gonna start blasting away.

912
01:11:14,557 --> 01:11:15,394
(squelching)

913
01:11:15,394 --> 01:11:17,386
(gasping)

914
01:11:17,386 --> 01:11:19,886
(eerie music)

915
01:11:21,162 --> 01:11:23,328
(gagging)

916
01:11:43,167 --> 01:11:46,399
(ominous music)

917
01:11:46,399 --> 01:11:48,567
(gagging)

918
01:12:02,109 --> 01:12:04,275
(gasping)

919
01:12:07,110 --> 01:12:09,528
(whimpering)

920
01:12:10,649 --> 01:12:13,315
(ominous music)

921
01:12:18,827 --> 01:12:21,577
(sinister music)

922
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:33,752
(birds chirping)

923
01:12:36,729 --> 01:12:37,853
- So you see,

924
01:12:38,819 --> 01:12:40,243
that one was my story.

925
01:12:42,233 --> 01:12:44,983
(pleasant music)

926
01:13:02,579 --> 01:13:04,050
Like I said,

927
01:13:04,050 --> 01:13:06,932
some strange things have happened
here over the years.

928
01:13:08,494 --> 01:13:11,244
(pleasant music)

929
01:13:31,189 --> 01:13:34,273
