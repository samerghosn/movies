181
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,147
That was amazing!

182

Whoa.

190
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:22,601
SASHA: That's a lot of scuba gear.

191
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,311
This is all the equipment that
your stepdad and Ben have been storing

192
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:27,576
for the archaeologist team
that's coming next week.

193
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,086
Is this the entrance to the City?

194
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,794
Guys, if my Dad finds us,
he's going to kill us.

195
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,834
Chill. I talked to Ben.

196
00:17:34,886 --> 00:17:37,673
Your dad is on the other side
mapping out the new tunnel they found.

197
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,505
They will never know we were here.

198
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,845
Doesn't look like much of a city to me.

199
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,599
It's Mayan.

200
00:17:44,145 --> 00:17:46,807
It was built underground
out of their burial sites,

201
00:17:47,607 --> 00:17:49,940
to hide from the Conquistadors
when they invaded.

202
00:17:51,444 --> 00:17:54,481
Rising sea levels
put most of it underwater.

203
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:56,271
Thank you, Professor.

204
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,781
Did Ben ever take you
diving into the city?

205
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,614
Yeah, once.

206
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:02,449
MIA: What's it like?

207
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,614
It's pretty insane down there.

208
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,374
I mean, we only went as far
as the first cave.

209
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:11,038
It was built as an entrance to...

210
00:18:11,089 --> 00:18:13,172
- Is it Xibalba?
- Xibalba. Yeah.

211
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:16,709
- Place of fear.
- Yeah.

212
00:18:16,761 --> 00:18:19,298
- Like I was saying, the Mayan underworld.
- Mm-hmm.

213
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,467
Burial caves.

214
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,224
Yeah, it's pretty scary,
but it's really cool.

215
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:29,263
They have all these old statues
and altars and stuff.

216
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,561
So what are we waiting for?

217
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,653
Come on. Just the first cave.

218
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:38,564
- But my dad...
- Ls miles away!

219
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:42,443
- Yeah, they have a different way in.
- Here, look.

220
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,156
Everything we need.

221
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:46,655
I mean, there's no fins, 80...

222
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:49,659
<i>Come on! It's the first cave.
We're not swimming the whole city.</i>

223
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,082
Guys, cave diving is dangerous.

224
00:18:52,088 --> 00:18:55,047
- (MOCKINGLY) "Cave diving is dangerous!"
- No. Mia is right, Nicole.

225
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,790
I don't really know about this.

226
00:18:56,801 --> 00:19:00,589
Look, we've come all this way and
we don't even see the temple? Really?

227
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,597
- It's unlike anything you ever seen.
- Yeah.

228
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:06,180
We should just go in, go once
around the first cave, and then out.

229
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:07,676
NICOLE: Yeah. Come on.

230
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,183
When was the last time
you went diving?

231
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:12,897
Years ago.

232
00:19:12,942 --> 00:19:14,933
- I used to go all the time with Dad...
- Perfect.

233
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,022
But I've never been in caves before.

234
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,065
It's like riding a bike, right? I mean...

235
00:19:21,117 --> 00:19:22,653
- Ah, come on, Mia!
- Mia!

236

Okay, yeah, let's go. Let's do it!</i>

nice and small.
