1
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,999
I hate television...gives me headaches.

2
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:11,998
You know I heard there were so many magnetic waves
travelling through the air because of TV and telephones

3
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:15,997
then we're losing like 10 times as many
braincells as we're supposed to

4
00:01:16,498 --> 00:01:23,048
like...all molecules in our heads are all unstable, all the
companies know about it but they're not doing anything about it

5
00:01:23,098 --> 00:01:25,797
it's a big conspiracy.

6
00:01:26,298 --> 00:01:28,497
You can pick something, I don't care.

7
00:01:32,697 --> 00:01:37,595
Do you have any idea how many electro-rays
are travelling through our head every second?

8
00:01:37,695 --> 00:01:42,495
I got a better one...have you heard about this
videotape that kills you when you watch it?

9
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:44,745
What kind of tape?

10
00:01:44,795 --> 00:01:46,546
A tape...a regular tape

11
00:01:46,596 --> 00:01:48,596
People run it...I don't know

12
00:01:48,646 --> 00:01:51,995
You start to play it...and it's like
somebody's nightmare

13
00:01:52,495 --> 00:01:53,995
then suddenly

14
00:01:54,194 --> 00:01:55,993
this woman comes on

15
00:01:56,193 --> 00:01:57,993
smiling at you, right?

16
00:01:58,193 --> 00:02:01,593
seeing you through the screen

17
00:02:01,993 --> 00:02:03,993
And as soon as it's over

18
00:02:04,494 --> 00:02:06,693
your phone rings

19
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:09,392
Someone knows you've watched it.

20
00:02:09,793 --> 00:02:11,991
And what they say is:

21
00:02:12,192 --> 00:02:15,492
'You will die in 7 days.'

22
00:02:15,993 --> 00:02:20,092
And exactly 7 days later...
Who told you that?

23
00:02:20,292 --> 00:02:22,590
...somebody from Revere...
Who told you?

24
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,492
What's your problem?

25
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:27,790
I've watched it

26
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:29,991
It's a story, Katie!

27
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,990
No, me and Josh. We saw
it last weekend.

28
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,590
I thought you were with
your parents!

29
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,491
I wanted to tell you...
You were with Josh all weekend?

30
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:38,391
Some of his friends got this place
up in the mountains

31
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,188
They were trying to record
a football game

32
00:02:40,288 --> 00:02:42,238
I guess the reception was so bad

33
00:02:42,288 --> 00:02:43,789
What are you talking about...?
Listen to me!

34
00:02:43,839 --> 00:02:46,489
We played the tape, the
game wasn't there.

35
00:02:46,589 --> 00:02:47,839
It was...

36
00:02:50,488 --> 00:02:52,988
What? What was it?

37
00:02:53,987 --> 00:02:55,986
It was something else...

38
00:02:58,189 --> 00:03:00,987
We thought it was some
kind of sick joke

39
00:03:01,587 --> 00:03:04,486
but then the phone rang

40
00:03:06,485 --> 00:03:08,486
It was a week ago

41
00:03:09,486 --> 00:03:11,487
a week ago tonight.

42
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:16,485
You're just trying to scare me.

43
00:03:32,284 --> 00:03:34,583
You freak!

44
00:03:34,985 --> 00:03:37,682
You totally fell for it.
No.

45
00:03:38,483 --> 00:03:42,284
So did you guys, you know, do anything?

46
00:03:43,983 --> 00:03:45,983
Like what?

47
00:03:46,982 --> 00:03:50,982
Oh my god. You totally did,
you're a whore...No.

48
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,179
There really is a tape...?

49
00:04:33,978 --> 00:04:35,977
This is so lame.

50
00:04:36,176 --> 00:04:38,178
Embry residence...?

51
00:04:55,974 --> 00:04:57,774
Hello?

52
00:04:59,974 --> 00:05:01,674
Hi, Mom.

53
00:05:03,474 --> 00:05:04,973
Yeah, that was Becca.

54
00:05:05,275 --> 00:05:07,123
My mom says Hi. She's glad that
you're here.

55
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:09,573
Ask her where she keeps her Vicodin.

56
00:05:10,774 --> 00:05:12,374
Yeah, we're about to go to sleep.

57
00:05:13,272 --> 00:05:14,974
Okay. Yeah, I will.

58
00:05:15,974 --> 00:05:17,973
Ok, ok, yeah yeah I will!

59
00:05:19,973 --> 00:05:21,972
No, I won't.

60
00:05:22,972 --> 00:05:24,672
Bye Mom!

61
00:05:49,968 --> 00:05:52,469
Becca, quit being a bitch! Where
is the remote?

62
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:19,765
Becca, quit!!!

63
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,260
Becca, can you hear me?

64
00:08:20,453 --> 00:08:21,953
Don't tell me what to do!

65
00:08:25,953 --> 00:08:27,852
I am being objective!

66
00:08:27,952 --> 00:08:29,753
Listen Harvey, you punctilious prick!

67
00:08:29,953 --> 00:08:32,450
You touch my column,
and I'm coming down there

68
00:08:32,501 --> 00:08:35,452
poking your eye out with that little
red pencil you like so much!

69
00:08:36,451 --> 00:08:37,949
Harvey?!

70
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:39,651
shooot!

71
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:42,452
Hey!

72
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:45,450
Hi.

73
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:49,450
Sorry I'm late.
No worries.

74
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:52,451
I want my own car.

75
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:58,150
Have you got a moment, miss Keller?
Um, sure!

76
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,947
Call me Rachel.
Please, sit down.

77
00:09:01,949 --> 00:09:03,948
He certainly is very independent, isn't he?

78
00:09:04,048 --> 00:09:05,647
Oh yeah. He sure is.

79
00:09:05,748 --> 00:09:07,748
I never have to tell him to do anything.

80
00:09:07,949 --> 00:09:11,448
Well, if that's a problem you'd be the first
teacher in history to say so.

81
00:09:12,947 --> 00:09:14,948
Miss Keller...
Rachel.

82
00:09:16,447 --> 00:09:21,646
I know that Aidan miss and just lost his cousin...Yes, and I'm
doing what I can to find him some good daycare, it's just...

83
00:09:21,696 --> 00:09:24,548
No, that's not what I meant. By all means,
take your time.

84
00:09:24,646 --> 00:09:27,846
I know they were very close.
Aidan and his cousin.

85
00:09:27,895 --> 00:09:29,944
Yeah. They spent a few nights
a week together.

86
00:09:30,045 --> 00:09:31,945
Did he talk to you about her death?

87
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:35,945
Well, like you said, he's not
the talkative type.

88
00:09:36,346 --> 00:09:38,944
That doesn't mean he has
nothing to say.

89
00:09:40,943 --> 00:09:42,943
He knows I'm there.

90
00:09:43,043 --> 00:09:44,894
Yes, I'm sure he does.

91
00:09:44,944 --> 00:09:50,544
But he may be expressing himself
in....other ways.

92
00:09:50,644 --> 00:09:52,642
I'd like to show you something.

93
00:10:03,141 --> 00:10:04,942
That's his cousin.

94
00:10:05,643 --> 00:10:06,941
That's Katie.

95
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:11,441
Miss Keller...I'm bothered by
these drawings.

96
00:10:14,941 --> 00:10:20,940
Listen...I appreciate your concern. But
my son lost his best friend 3 nights ago.

97
00:10:20,989 --> 00:10:22,239
He's just trying to deal with it.

98
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,890
Yes, I understand, but these pictures

99
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,088
are Aidan's way of working it out.

100
00:10:26,138 --> 00:10:28,640
of expressing himself, like you said.

101
00:10:30,938 --> 00:10:32,938
He'll be okay.

102
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:36,538
You say she died 3 nights ago.

103
00:10:37,339 --> 00:10:38,938
Yeah, that's right.

104
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,638
Aidan drew these last week.

105
00:11:06,735 --> 00:11:07,935
What?

106
00:11:10,335 --> 00:11:11,934
Nothing.

107
00:11:21,434 --> 00:11:22,732
Should we read something?

108
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:24,134
I'm kinda tired.

109
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,433
Okay.

110
00:11:27,133 --> 00:11:29,033
Sweet dreams.

111
00:11:32,032 --> 00:11:34,532
We don't have enough time.

112
00:11:35,931 --> 00:11:38,933
Honey, I know we've been
working a lot

113
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:42,930
and I'm sorry, but I promise you
I'm gonna make it up to you.

114
00:11:43,031 --> 00:11:44,831
I'm not talking about that.

115
00:11:44,931 --> 00:11:47,330
I'm talking about time
before we die.

116
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:51,430
You have lots of time.

117
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:53,931
So you know when I'm
going to die?

118
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,229
No. No one does.

119
00:11:56,928 --> 00:11:59,431
But I know you don't have
to worry about it.

120
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,430
Katie knew.

121
00:12:02,479 --> 00:12:03,929
She told me.

122
00:12:04,329 --> 00:12:06,428
Katie told you she was
gonna die?

123
00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:08,927
She said she didn't had
enough time.

124
00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:13,628
Good night, Rachel.

125
00:12:32,726 --> 00:12:33,925
shooot!

126
00:12:36,427 --> 00:12:38,426
Aidan?!

127
00:12:40,425 --> 00:12:45,424
God damn it! Honey?!
Have you seen my black dress?

128
00:12:45,924 --> 00:12:46,924
Aidan?

129
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:51,923
Have you seen my black....dress?

130
00:12:55,923 --> 00:12:57,924
It's a little wrinkled.

131
00:13:02,922 --> 00:13:04,922
It's fine.

132
00:14:22,914 --> 00:14:24,914
Oh Ruthie.

133
00:14:25,914 --> 00:14:27,913
I'm so sorry.

134
00:14:37,112 --> 00:14:39,313
Are you alright, Dave?

135
00:14:41,912 --> 00:14:43,312
Yeah, I'm fine.

136
00:14:44,613 --> 00:14:45,912
How are you?

137
00:14:54,909 --> 00:14:56,910
He sleeps all day

138
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,909
doesn't move

139
00:15:00,909 --> 00:15:02,910
it's too much for him.

140
00:15:05,908 --> 00:15:08,111
It doesn't make any sense, Rachel.

141
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,910
I spent 4 hours on the Internet and I

142
00:15:11,957 --> 00:15:17,909
couldn't find one single case of a 16-year old
girl's heart just stopping.

143
00:15:18,558 --> 00:15:20,058
I spoke to 3 different doctors

144
00:15:20,108 --> 00:15:24,907
and not one of them could tell me
exactly what happened to my daughter.

145
00:15:29,707 --> 00:15:33,906
She was close....with you

146
00:15:34,007 --> 00:15:35,106
and Aidan

147
00:15:35,707 --> 00:15:37,406
She confided in you.

148
00:15:37,506 --> 00:15:40,706
Yeah, but she never said anything.

149
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:43,006
Nothing that would have explained
what happened.

150
00:15:43,056 --> 00:15:45,056
You could find out.

151
00:15:46,406 --> 00:15:49,905
It's what you do, isn't it?
Ask questions?

152
00:15:51,905 --> 00:15:53,904
Rachel, please

153
00:15:58,904 --> 00:16:00,704
I saw her face.

154
00:16:12,202 --> 00:16:15,103
...I mean she was a little intense,
but she wasn't crazy.

155
00:16:15,202 --> 00:16:18,401
And who put you into this straitjacket
if you just freaked out?

156
00:16:18,702 --> 00:16:21,102
Something scared the shooot out of her.

157
00:16:22,299 --> 00:16:23,301
Hi.

158
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:28,201
So who's in the mental hospital?

159
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,400
Becca. Katie's friend.

160
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,900
Oh, right. She was the one who was...

161
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,400
...there. When it happened.

162
00:16:36,801 --> 00:16:38,900
So what do you think they
were doing up there?

163
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:42,599
Oh, thanks.

164
00:16:43,898 --> 00:16:45,798
I remember I was that age

165
00:16:45,897 --> 00:16:50,098
me and my girlfriend used to
sneak up to my room, get high

166
00:16:50,248 --> 00:16:51,898
do you think maybe she was into...

167
00:16:51,949 --> 00:16:53,697
...It's not about that.

168
00:16:54,898 --> 00:16:56,097
It's about the tape.

169
00:16:56,297 --> 00:16:58,398
Alan, don't even...

170
00:16:58,898 --> 00:16:59,998
What tape?

171
00:17:00,496 --> 00:17:03,696
The one that kills you when you watch it.
Oh, please

172
00:17:04,196 --> 00:17:05,697
What was on the tape?

173
00:17:07,295 --> 00:17:08,697
I haven't seen it, obviously.

174
00:17:08,747 --> 00:17:11,246
But Katie told you she
saw this tape.

175
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:13,595
Not Katie, I heard it
from her boyf...

176
00:17:15,195 --> 00:17:16,796
You heard it from who?

177
00:17:17,895 --> 00:17:19,895
She was dating this guy Josh

178
00:17:20,095 --> 00:17:21,895
He goes to Revere.

179
00:17:21,944 --> 00:17:23,544
It was kind of a secret.

180
00:17:23,595 --> 00:17:24,595
Kind of?

181
00:17:24,894 --> 00:17:28,293
Where is he? Josh...is he here?
Josh is dead.

182
00:17:28,343 --> 00:17:29,395
What?

183
00:17:30,695 --> 00:17:31,995
What happened?

184
00:17:32,393 --> 00:17:34,694
Supposedly he killed himself.

185
00:17:35,894 --> 00:17:38,093
The same night that Katie died.

186
00:18:59,585 --> 00:19:01,085
Aidan

187
00:19:01,385 --> 00:19:03,684
What are you doing in here?

188
00:19:05,385 --> 00:19:06,333
Come on.

189
00:19:06,383 --> 00:19:08,182
We shouldn't be in her room.

190
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:11,382
It's not her room anymore.

Josh Turandot

193
00:20:44,874 --> 00:20:47,672
Back Bay teen dies in
high-rise fall

194
00:20:49,172 --> 00:20:50,373
10 p.m.

195
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:59,071
One car accident kills two;
cause not determined

196
00:21:08,871 --> 00:21:10,069
10 p.m.

197
00:21:14,371 --> 00:21:16,520
Time of death, that's all
I wanna know.

198
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:19,869
Name is Katie Embry,
pull the report and read the time.

199
00:21:19,969 --> 00:21:22,068
No, that's ok, I'll hold.

200
00:21:22,769 --> 00:21:25,269
Punctilious prick?

201
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:27,869
Nice literation, huh?

202
00:21:28,268 --> 00:21:29,667
You're fired.
No, I'm not.

203
00:21:29,717 --> 00:21:32,218
Yes, you are.
No, I'm not.

204
00:21:32,468 --> 00:21:34,466
I'm cooking too good a story.

205
00:21:36,668 --> 00:21:37,767
What is it?

206
00:21:37,817 --> 00:21:39,167
Yeah, I'm still here.

207
00:21:44,867 --> 00:21:47,367
Ok, so what's the time of death?

208
00:21:52,866 --> 00:21:54,865
10 p.m.

SHELTER MOUNTAIN INN

210
00:22:33,961 --> 00:22:34,962
Hi, I'm sorry...

211
00:22:35,011 --> 00:22:38,859
...Pick a card! Any card.
Go ahead!

212
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,062
Put it back.

213
00:22:42,162 --> 00:22:43,861
Don't let me see it.

214
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,660
That your card?

215
00:22:50,958 --> 00:22:52,060
No

216
00:22:52,859 --> 00:22:53,960
Damn

217
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,859
I was wondering if you'd remember someone
from a week ago

218
00:22:58,058 --> 00:22:59,658
Is there a problem?

219
00:22:59,858 --> 00:23:04,058
It's my niece. She sort of
ran out on her parents.

220
00:23:05,458 --> 00:23:06,359
No

221
00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:10,456
I have some photos here.
That's her, and her friends

222
00:23:10,657 --> 00:23:12,657
I think they stayed here
a night or so.

223
00:23:12,757 --> 00:23:17,157
Yeah. They were in cabin 12.
They didn't pay.

224
00:23:17,356 --> 00:23:19,355
They had a number of complaints.

225
00:23:19,405 --> 00:23:21,456
Bout the TV mainly.

226
00:23:22,057 --> 00:23:24,356
Reception is never good here.

227
00:23:24,356 --> 00:23:27,256
That's why we bought tape-players
for videos

228
00:23:28,856 --> 00:23:30,855
Quite a selection.

229
00:23:31,954 --> 00:23:35,356
Mostly they're hand-me-downs
left by the guests.

230
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:36,455
Anyway

231
00:23:36,554 --> 00:23:38,455
they didn't pay

232
00:23:38,655 --> 00:23:41,555
and kids like that
sometimes don't

233
00:23:41,852 --> 00:23:42,853
Miss?

234
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:44,054
You know...

235
00:23:44,104 --> 00:23:48,854
...I'm kind of tired. I'm thinking I might
take a nap before I drive back.

236
00:23:49,353 --> 00:23:51,353
I'll take cabin 12.

237
00:24:03,852 --> 00:24:04,851
Hey!

238
00:24:06,451 --> 00:24:08,452
This is your card, right?

239
00:24:10,851 --> 00:24:12,052
That's it!

240
00:27:02,832 --> 00:27:04,832
Seven Days

241
00:27:33,828 --> 00:27:35,830
I'm going to school!

242
00:28:13,326 --> 00:28:15,325
What do you think?

243
00:28:15,376 --> 00:28:17,324
Pretty cool effect

244
00:28:18,724 --> 00:28:21,024
What does this have to
do with the tape?

245
00:28:22,323 --> 00:28:24,125
Take my picture.

246
00:28:30,023 --> 00:28:32,223
Are you gonna look at
me at least?

247
00:28:37,823 --> 00:28:39,673
This the same camera?

248
00:28:39,723 --> 00:28:40,722
No

249
00:28:40,772 --> 00:28:42,321
Scan the rest.

250
00:28:46,121 --> 00:28:48,771
So? What do you think?

251
00:28:52,421 --> 00:28:55,019
I thought you said this
was about a tape.

252
00:29:01,819 --> 00:29:03,819
I'm thinking maybe you
shouldn't see it.

253
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:07,020
No, I should know more
about it first.

254
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,219
Well isn't that why I'm here?

255
00:29:09,269 --> 00:29:10,920
So you can benefit
from my wisdom?

256
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:12,920
4 kids are dead, Noah.

257
00:29:13,317 --> 00:29:15,918
Not from watching
a videotape.

258
00:29:20,517 --> 00:29:22,018
Show it to me.

259
00:30:36,809 --> 00:30:38,809
No credits

260
00:30:39,309 --> 00:30:41,709
That was very student film.

261
00:30:43,308 --> 00:30:46,809
Um, sure it's a lot
scarier at night

262
00:30:53,808 --> 00:30:55,807
You're gonna get that?

263
00:31:14,605 --> 00:31:16,305
So, you've been working a lot?

264
00:31:16,355 --> 00:31:18,306
I'm not tired, Noah!

265
00:31:19,105 --> 00:31:20,006
Ok

266
00:31:20,057 --> 00:31:21,905
That tape didn't scare you?

267
00:31:22,305 --> 00:31:23,955
No, not really. Sorry.

268
00:31:24,006 --> 00:31:25,804
4 people are dead!

269
00:31:25,856 --> 00:31:27,303
Like I said...

270
00:31:27,353 --> 00:31:28,754
4 people who watched it

271
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:30,754
Come on, we watched it

272
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:32,805
It...takes...a week.

273
00:31:34,303 --> 00:31:35,303
Right

274
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:38,302
You know I'm just gonna go downtown,
I gotta pick up some cameras from this guy

275
00:31:38,352 --> 00:31:40,351
and then I gotta prep this thing,
I may not do it next weekend...

276
00:31:40,401 --> 00:31:41,401
Noah

277
00:31:41,703 --> 00:31:43,903
would you say that I'm gullible?

278
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:44,703
No

279
00:31:44,803 --> 00:31:46,102
Easily rattled?

280
00:31:46,152 --> 00:31:47,101
Definitely not

281
00:31:47,151 --> 00:31:49,502
a little highly-strung maybe

282
00:31:50,501 --> 00:31:51,802
you ain't much of a dresser

283
00:31:51,852 --> 00:31:54,801
Who made it?
Where did it come from?

284
00:31:57,401 --> 00:31:58,552
Alright

285
00:31:58,601 --> 00:32:00,801
make me a copy,
I'll see what I can do.

286
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,500
Thanks

287
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:02,588
You sure this is a copy?

288
00:34:02,687 --> 00:34:03,987
Yeah, why?

289
00:34:05,788 --> 00:34:08,087
The numbers are all screwed up.

290
00:34:10,287 --> 00:34:13,486
Same problem got copied, I guess.

291
00:34:14,486 --> 00:34:15,785
That's impossible.

292
00:34:16,286 --> 00:34:19,485
The numbers of the control track, they're
put on the tape whenever it's recorded

293
00:34:19,536 --> 00:34:22,986
which means theoretically there
shouldn't be any images

294
00:34:23,286 --> 00:34:27,484
Hey, Noah, can you pretend for 1 minute
that I don't read Video Geek Magazine?

295
00:34:27,785 --> 00:34:29,585
Okay, when you record a tape

296
00:34:29,786 --> 00:34:32,385
the makeup of the tracks is like a
signature for whatever did the recording

297
00:34:32,435 --> 00:34:34,984
like a camcorder, VCR, whatever

298
00:34:35,034 --> 00:34:37,284
so the control tracker tells
where it came from.

299
00:34:37,785 --> 00:34:41,583
But to not have one, I mean that's
like being born without fingerprints.

300
00:34:41,784 --> 00:34:43,983
Then how did this get recorded?

301
00:34:44,783 --> 00:34:46,282
I don't know.

302
00:34:46,783 --> 00:34:48,782
But I'm gonna find out

303
00:34:50,483 --> 00:34:51,982
Alright, take a look

304
00:34:52,282 --> 00:34:55,132
you should be able to see the camera
here in the reflection.

305
00:34:55,182 --> 00:34:57,531
The angle is straight on,
but you don't

306
00:34:57,581 --> 00:34:59,480
Mmm...what's that?

307
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:01,732
Looks like she's walking away
whoever she is

308
00:35:01,782 --> 00:35:03,782
No, I mean up there at the top.

309
00:35:04,779 --> 00:35:07,182
Uh, that's just the tracking,
I can fix that.

310
00:35:09,281 --> 00:35:12,231
Wait! Go back.
There's something there.

311
00:35:12,281 --> 00:35:13,080
Yeah, you're right.

312
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:14,931
There's more picture.

313
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:17,079
Hold on. I'm gonna stretch the
alignment

314
00:35:17,179 --> 00:35:18,779
Yeah, it's working.
Ok, keep going.

315
00:35:18,829 --> 00:35:20,780
Nonono, let me do it!
Come on!

316
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:23,279
What are you doing?
Let me do it! shooot!

317
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:29,978
Hey Noah! I picked up the cameras.
They're in really good shape.

318
00:35:30,028 --> 00:35:32,877
Did you see the reports I did
about that Guatemala stuff?

319
00:35:32,927 --> 00:35:34,380
It came out kind of...

320
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,977
overexposed

321
00:35:37,577 --> 00:35:38,628
You're working?

322
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:42,426
This is a friend...Rachel Keller.
She writes for the P.I.

323
00:35:42,477 --> 00:35:45,277
Rachel, this is Beth, my assistant.

324
00:35:45,628 --> 00:35:47,976
Wanna prefer Partner in Crime?

325
00:35:48,278 --> 00:35:50,926
She's a journalism student at
Kirkland actually.

326
00:35:50,975 --> 00:35:54,476
Oh. I'll stay out of your way.
I'm not even here.

327
00:35:55,976 --> 00:36:00,375
Rachel is researching the story, of
this video-hoaxes, sort of interesting.

328
00:36:00,425 --> 00:36:02,724
You know video, why don't you come
and look at this thing with the tracking?

329
00:36:02,775 --> 00:36:05,274
You know I'm late. I really should go.

330
00:36:05,324 --> 00:36:08,774
Yeah, but why are you taking the...
I gotta go! It's good to meet you.

331
00:36:14,272 --> 00:36:17,073
You're taking the tape?
I don't want her to see it.

332
00:36:17,274 --> 00:36:19,873
Whoa! You don't want her to see, what
about me seeing it?

333
00:36:19,924 --> 00:36:21,673
You had no problem showing it to me.

334
00:36:21,723 --> 00:36:23,623
I did have a problem!

335
00:36:24,072 --> 00:36:25,071
You're angry.

336
00:36:25,122 --> 00:36:26,372
I'm not angry

337
00:36:26,422 --> 00:36:28,771
Oh no? What are you then?
In a hurry.

338
00:36:30,773 --> 00:36:35,070
I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna get all
worked up over some high school rumour.

339
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:39,719
What are you thinking?

340
00:36:39,769 --> 00:36:43,971
I'm thinking this is the part where
I say you're a flake, never finishes anything,

341
00:36:44,021 --> 00:36:47,070
and you say I'm an obsessive bitch,
needs to lighten up,

342
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:52,070
then I storm out, all pissed-off, kicking
myself for ever thinking that you could just...

343
00:36:52,769 --> 00:36:54,770
grow up!

344
00:36:59,169 --> 00:37:03,669
So why don't we just cut to that part right
now and save ourselves a lot of grief!

345
00:37:06,867 --> 00:37:10,267
Alright! Bye.

346
00:37:37,965 --> 00:37:42,065
Watch out Missy! Bad luck.
We don't need that.

347
00:38:12,662 --> 00:38:16,259
Becca? Becca.

348
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,762
You are almost there.

349
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:30,158
Do you remember anything
about that night?

350
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:33,058
That night with Katie.

351
00:38:35,558 --> 00:38:37,558
Do you remember

352
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:40,158
how she died?

353
00:38:43,057 --> 00:38:44,958
Becca?

354
00:38:55,456 --> 00:38:58,256
She told you about a video tape,
didn't she?

355
00:39:03,354 --> 00:39:05,655
She was afraid, wasn't she?

356
00:39:06,254 --> 00:39:10,155
Something was happening to her.
Becca...

357
00:39:11,554 --> 00:39:13,454
how did she die?

358
00:39:14,453 --> 00:39:15,953
Please

359
00:39:16,556 --> 00:39:18,254
I need to know.

360
00:39:21,554 --> 00:39:23,153
And you will.

361
00:39:27,253 --> 00:39:29,052
She'll show you.

362
00:39:29,502 --> 00:39:32,752
Who? Who will show me?

363
00:39:34,052 --> 00:39:35,752
Not now.

364
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:45,650
4 days

365
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:55,850
Yeah, well your home-VCR:s will give you a
tracking wind-up, but they won't let you stretch it

366
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:58,598
so no point really, unless we're
talking restoration.

367
00:39:58,648 --> 00:40:01,250
Archives will come in here with these
primual-tapes sometimes,

368
00:40:01,299 --> 00:40:04,649
tracks totally shot, servos can't
line them up, big box,

369
00:40:04,699 --> 00:40:08,849
here's the most totally.....will read
to the very edge of your tape.

370
00:40:08,899 --> 00:40:11,048
Just don't force her, or she'll
get pissy with you.

371
00:40:11,098 --> 00:40:14,449
Your tracking, your monitor, your printer.

372
00:40:15,648 --> 00:40:18,647
So, what are we watching?
Home-movies or something?

373
00:40:19,847 --> 00:40:21,847
I really rather watch it alone.

374
00:40:23,946 --> 00:40:25,048
Really

375
00:40:25,746 --> 00:40:27,246
Whatever

376
00:40:42,444 --> 00:40:43,646
Come on

377
00:40:48,644 --> 00:40:49,744
Come on

378
00:41:04,141 --> 00:41:05,943
Lighthouse

379
00:41:08,742 --> 00:41:09,741
shooot!

380
00:41:11,342 --> 00:41:13,741
Hello? Somebody!

381
00:41:56,437 --> 00:41:58,636
Something you needed help with?

382
00:41:59,935 --> 00:42:02,537
Hey, you got a...a...

383
00:42:12,936 --> 00:42:14,535
Well, these seem to be the lot of it.

384
00:42:14,736 --> 00:42:15,735
Thank you

00:45:29,613 --> 00:45:31,715
What happened to you, Anna?

397
00:45:43,812 --> 00:45:45,812
Take a double Lights, thanks.

399
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:54,512
You're gonna die.

400
00:45:55,311 --> 00:46:00,262
My cousin was 2 packs a day.
Used a patch. Never looked back.

401
00:46:00,312 --> 00:46:02,310
Well, I'll keep that in mind.

402
00:46:03,009 --> 00:46:04,360
Have a nice day.

403
00:46:04,411 --> 00:46:05,712
You too

404
00:46:54,005 --> 00:46:54,804
Hi

405
00:46:54,854 --> 00:46:56,655
Sorry I'm late.

406
00:46:56,705 --> 00:46:58,203
No, no problem

407
00:46:58,253 --> 00:46:59,853
Everything ok?

408
00:46:59,904 --> 00:47:02,954
Oh, yeah, he was an angel.

409
00:47:03,005 --> 00:47:05,954
Right, I went in to tell him
that it was bedtime,

410
00:47:06,003 --> 00:47:10,203
and he was already under the covers,
and then he read me a bedtime-story.

411
00:47:11,803 --> 00:47:14,502
Um, he learned the word 'conundrum'.

412
00:47:14,553 --> 00:47:15,103
Really?

413
00:47:15,154 --> 00:47:18,602
Yeah, and then he drew my picture.

414
00:47:19,902 --> 00:47:21,802
Well, here you go.

415
00:47:22,503 --> 00:47:23,801
Thanks.
Sure.

416
00:47:56,298 --> 00:47:59,848
Hey Ruthie, it's me. I'm sorry to call
so late, but I need a favour.

417
00:47:59,898 --> 00:48:01,348
I have to go upstate, too.

418
00:48:01,398 --> 00:48:03,547
To this story. I need you to
watch Aidan for me...

419
00:48:03,597 --> 00:48:06,297
Oh, Rachel, I don't know.
How long will you be gone?

420
00:48:06,348 --> 00:48:08,297
It's just for 2 days.
I promise.

421
00:48:08,347 --> 00:48:10,196
It isn't the best time.

422
00:48:10,896 --> 00:48:13,197
Rachel? Rachel are you there?

423
00:48:13,246 --> 00:48:15,694
Hold On! Sorry.

424
00:48:18,197 --> 00:48:21,696
Rachel? Is this about Katie?

425
00:48:46,492 --> 00:48:48,292
Ruthie?

426
00:49:10,390 --> 00:49:12,190
Aidan?

427
00:50:22,782 --> 00:50:24,282
NOOO!!!

428
00:50:32,781 --> 00:50:34,780
Why, baby? Why? Why?

429
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:36,980
I couldn't sleep.

430
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:44,981
Who is she, Rachel?

431
00:51:02,077 --> 00:51:04,079
Leave him alone!!!

432
00:51:04,578 --> 00:51:05,879
Rachel?

433
00:51:10,078 --> 00:51:10,927
Noah

434
00:51:10,977 --> 00:51:12,678
Listen to me, Rachel.

435
00:51:13,978 --> 00:51:16,278
I need to talk to you, can I...

436
00:51:19,776 --> 00:51:21,675
...I believe you.

437
00:51:22,676 --> 00:51:24,678
Rachel, you there?

438
00:51:27,076 --> 00:51:29,275
He watched the tape.

439
00:51:30,775 --> 00:51:32,674
Who? Who watched it?

440
00:51:36,275 --> 00:51:37,974
Our son

441
00:52:03,172 --> 00:52:05,171
You took some picture.

442
00:52:08,972 --> 00:52:10,971
I've seen you.

443
00:52:11,772 --> 00:52:14,270
While I'm in the yard at school.

444
00:52:14,971 --> 00:52:16,870
You were there.

445
00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:20,971
You wish I was around more?

446
00:52:21,021 --> 00:52:22,070
No

447
00:52:23,770 --> 00:52:25,769
You wanna be around more?

448
00:52:27,268 --> 00:52:28,619
Rachel and I we're...

449
00:52:28,669 --> 00:52:29,669
Wrong

450
00:52:30,668 --> 00:52:32,869
Mom's told me that story.

451
00:52:37,066 --> 00:52:38,968
The thing is

452
00:52:39,017 --> 00:52:41,467
I don't think I'll make
a good father.

453
00:52:43,368 --> 00:52:45,666
Maybe it was because my own was

454
00:52:46,667 --> 00:52:48,168
such a

455
00:52:48,467 --> 00:52:50,066
disappointment.

456
00:52:58,265 --> 00:53:01,165
And I don't want anyone
else to do it either.

457
00:53:04,265 --> 00:53:05,766
Your father

458
00:53:06,966 --> 00:53:09,164
It's a conundrum.

459
00:53:12,864 --> 00:53:15,063
Yeah, it is.

460
00:53:52,959 --> 00:53:54,710
Time to go, mister.

461
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:56,660
I'm not finished.

462
00:53:57,959 --> 00:54:00,360
Noah said to make one for you.

463
00:54:08,558 --> 00:54:11,358
You could almost draw a
line through her life.

464
00:54:12,459 --> 00:54:16,457
A once...happy woman who spends
her time with her husband.

465
00:54:16,506 --> 00:54:21,057
Riding horses, everything sheltered,
protected and comfortable.

466
00:54:22,558 --> 00:54:26,956
Her face, there's...light.
There's pride.

467
00:54:27,256 --> 00:54:29,355
And then one day something happens

468
00:54:29,406 --> 00:54:33,456
and she takes this hard corner
and then light...goes out.

469
00:54:33,806 --> 00:54:38,655
And then she ends up in
Eola County Psychiatric, all alone.

470
00:54:38,705 --> 00:54:40,355
What happened to her?

471
00:54:41,254 --> 00:54:45,755
I don't know yet, but I think it has
something to do with the horses.

472
00:54:46,254 --> 00:54:47,854
I think we should go to
the island together.

473
00:54:47,903 --> 00:54:51,354
It's Tuesday, Noah.
I only have 1 day left.

474
00:54:51,404 --> 00:54:55,254
I need you to go to the hospital, and
find out as much as you can about Anna.

475
00:54:55,853 --> 00:54:58,153
The images on the tape
relieves somewhere.

476
00:54:59,554 --> 00:55:01,403
Katie saw them all, too.

477
00:55:01,453 --> 00:55:02,951
I think

478
00:55:03,152 --> 00:55:05,852
Before you die, you see the ring.

479
00:55:19,652 --> 00:55:20,652
shooot

480
00:55:20,702 --> 00:55:22,750
Hey, Rach!
Wait!

481
00:55:27,850 --> 00:55:29,150
MOM

482
00:55:57,546 --> 00:55:59,645
Richard Morgan,

at horse show

484
00:56:12,046 --> 00:56:14,546
Onlookers said Anna Morgan,...

485
00:56:15,244 --> 00:56:17,495
...was holding her daughter
in her arms...

486
00:56:17,545 --> 00:56:19,143
Daughter?

487
00:56:59,770 --> 00:57:01,321
Hey you

488
00:57:07,768 --> 00:57:09,070
It's ok

489
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:10,918
I'm not gonna hurt you.

490
00:57:13,019 --> 00:57:14,518
Easy, boy

491
00:57:17,716 --> 00:57:19,517
That's it

492
00:57:26,215 --> 00:57:27,616
Hey, boy

493
00:57:27,917 --> 00:57:29,716
I'm not gonna hurt you.

494
00:57:34,716 --> 00:57:36,814
It's ok, calm down.

495
00:57:40,214 --> 00:57:41,713
Somebody!

496
00:57:50,912 --> 00:57:52,214
Jesus Christ

497
00:57:55,912 --> 00:57:57,612
Somebody help!

498
00:58:02,212 --> 00:58:03,712
Hey! My horse!

499
00:59:21,501 --> 00:59:24,100
I need to see the records for
a patient named Anna Morgan.

500
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:26,400
Are you a relative?

501
00:59:26,698 --> 00:59:27,899
Um, no

502
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:31,250
I'm sorry sir. We're a
mental health facility.

503
00:59:31,299 --> 00:59:32,749
Our records are private.

504
00:59:32,798 --> 00:59:35,699
Oh, she's been dead 24 years.
I don't think she'll mind.

505
00:59:36,397 --> 00:59:38,698
I'm sorry.
It's impossible.

506
00:59:39,598 --> 00:59:40,697
Look

507
00:59:41,398 --> 00:59:44,596
I've seen 'em before.
I've been up there.

508
00:59:44,647 --> 00:59:48,597
Nice try. The record-rooms
are downstairs, guy.

509
00:59:51,095 --> 00:59:52,296
You win

510
00:59:56,995 --> 00:59:58,195
Jerk-off

511
01:00:38,591 --> 01:00:40,288
You in here, Anna?

512
01:01:22,983 --> 01:01:24,884
Morgan Horse Farm

513
01:01:31,982 --> 01:01:33,082
Hello?

514
01:02:31,475 --> 01:02:33,074
Excuse me Mr. Morgan

515
01:02:33,375 --> 01:02:35,573
I was wondering if you'd have
a moment to speak with me.

516
01:02:35,773 --> 01:02:38,523
My name is Rachel Keller.
I'm a writer with the Seattle P.I.

517
01:02:38,574 --> 01:02:40,572
You wanna know about the horses.

518
01:02:42,872 --> 01:02:46,822
I didn't mean to...it's just I wasn't
able to find a number to reach you.

519
01:02:46,872 --> 01:02:49,821
Every now and then a
writer comes along

520
01:02:49,871 --> 01:02:51,721
heard about what happened

521
01:02:51,771 --> 01:02:54,120
What's left to write about though?

522
01:02:54,170 --> 01:02:55,370
I don't know.

523
01:02:55,769 --> 01:02:58,321
I was hoping you had
just a few minutes

524
01:02:58,371 --> 01:03:01,070
Well, work never ends
around here really,

525
01:03:01,569 --> 01:03:03,669
but I guess I got a few.

526
01:03:05,070 --> 01:03:07,770
So, what is it you're
writing, Miss?

527
01:03:08,069 --> 01:03:10,620
Bout horses in general or
that horses go strange?

528
01:03:10,669 --> 01:03:12,919
I read you had to put
so many down.

529
01:03:12,969 --> 01:03:15,117
Loads put themselves down.

530
01:03:15,168 --> 01:03:16,367
They drowned.

531
01:03:16,418 --> 01:03:17,817
How did they get out?

532
01:03:17,869 --> 01:03:20,567
Just broke through the fences,
and ran to the shore.

533
01:03:21,867 --> 01:03:23,816
So they went crazy?

534
01:03:23,867 --> 01:03:25,567
It will seem so, yes.

535
01:03:26,367 --> 01:03:29,367
Or maybe they just sensed
things before they jumped.

536
01:03:31,767 --> 01:03:33,865
So where are your horses now?

537
01:03:36,265 --> 01:03:37,964
I don't breed anymore.

538
01:03:39,165 --> 01:03:40,614
I guess you wouldn't.

539
01:03:40,664 --> 01:03:42,864
Not after what happened.

540
01:03:43,164 --> 01:03:45,164
That must have been hard.

541
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:47,063
On both of you.

542
01:03:47,263 --> 01:03:48,862
You and your wife.

543
01:03:52,561 --> 01:03:54,863
I'm sorry, Miss.
What's your name again?

544
01:03:57,812 --> 01:03:58,812
Rachel

545
01:03:58,862 --> 01:04:02,961
Well, Rachel. You wanna tell
me what's really on your mind?

546
01:04:07,561 --> 01:04:09,561
Do you know what this is?

547
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:13,859
I think it's a message

548
01:04:14,259 --> 01:04:16,059
from your wife.

549
01:04:16,858 --> 01:04:20,409
Anna is on this tape. She's
right there, in that room.

550
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:23,658
You can see the lighthouse,
the horses

551
01:04:25,857 --> 01:04:27,558
Where did you get that?

552
01:04:27,758 --> 01:04:29,757
Shelter Mountain Inn

553
01:04:31,356 --> 01:04:33,157
Is that the only one?

554
01:04:35,556 --> 01:04:37,356
I made a copy.

555
01:04:44,456 --> 01:04:47,355
I got a whole lot of work to do today.

556
01:04:48,355 --> 01:04:50,154
Other acres out there.

557
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:54,155
A minute I think I'm done
with one thing,

558
01:04:56,353 --> 01:04:58,254
another thing needs fixing.

559
01:04:59,753 --> 01:05:03,403
You don't wanna see this tape?
You're not even curious?

560
01:05:03,453 --> 01:05:04,902
Curious?

561
01:05:04,952 --> 01:05:06,952
No. I don't think so.

562
01:05:09,951 --> 01:05:11,102
Mr. Morgan

563
01:05:11,151 --> 01:05:12,852
I can't help you.

564
01:05:14,550 --> 01:05:16,152
Where is your daughter?

565
01:05:16,950 --> 01:05:19,850
Maybe she could help...
I don't have a daughter.

566
01:05:20,649 --> 01:05:21,699
Excuse me?

567
01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:23,549
What is it with reporters?

568
01:05:24,749 --> 01:05:28,748
You take one person's tragedy,
and force the world to experience it.

569
01:05:29,449 --> 01:05:31,649
You spread it like sickness.

570
01:05:32,450 --> 01:05:33,298
Mr. Morgan

571
01:05:33,348 --> 01:05:36,549
Tell me, Miss! What is
it you think you know?

572
01:05:39,550 --> 01:05:41,347
Then leave it alone.

573
01:07:03,336 --> 01:07:04,835
Anna Morgan

01:07:05,436 --> 01:07:07,135

580
01:08:13,326 --> 01:08:14,325
Aidan?

581
01:08:15,225 --> 01:08:17,226
Aidan?
It's your mom!

582
01:08:26,024 --> 01:08:26,973
Hi Mom.

583
01:08:27,024 --> 01:08:27,874
Honey.

584
01:08:27,924 --> 01:08:29,724
The house you drew for me,

585
01:08:30,125 --> 01:08:31,823
where did you see it?

586
01:08:32,223 --> 01:08:34,674
Did you see it in your head?
Is that why you drew it?

587
01:08:34,723 --> 01:08:36,322
In my head?

588
01:08:36,372 --> 01:08:39,322
Aidan, why did you
draw that house?

589
01:08:39,372 --> 01:08:41,322
She told me to.

590
01:08:41,373 --> 01:08:42,422
Who?

591
01:08:42,672 --> 01:08:44,223
Who told you to?

592
01:08:45,822 --> 01:08:47,822
The little girl.

593
01:08:51,721 --> 01:08:53,821
She talks to you?

594
01:08:54,622 --> 01:08:55,621
No

595
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:58,120
She shows me things.

596
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:00,520
Did she show you the horses?

597
01:09:01,620 --> 01:09:04,019
She doesn't like it in the barn.

598
01:09:04,718 --> 01:09:07,119
The horses keep her up at night.

599
01:09:08,419 --> 01:09:10,618
So she still lives there?

600
01:09:12,718 --> 01:09:13,819
No

601
01:09:15,517 --> 01:09:18,017
She lives in a dark place now.

602
01:09:44,914 --> 01:09:47,764
You're getting a little old to
be ..... out there, Cal!

603
01:09:47,814 --> 01:09:50,362
Your body has about outlived
its warranty, you know.

604
01:09:50,412 --> 01:09:52,263
........

605
01:09:52,313 --> 01:09:54,811
Let's see you catch one better.

606
01:09:55,012 --> 01:09:56,011
Yeah

607
01:09:57,112 --> 01:09:59,312
Good afternoon, I'm
Dr. Grasnik

608
01:10:00,011 --> 01:10:02,761
I...think he was before me.

609
01:10:02,910 --> 01:10:04,810
Darby? Darby is always here.

610
01:10:05,211 --> 01:10:06,911
Aren't you, Darby?

611
01:10:07,809 --> 01:10:09,660
He's my son's boy.

612
01:10:09,710 --> 01:10:11,461
Come over on the ferry,
did you?

613
01:10:11,510 --> 01:10:13,510
Yes. Um,

614
01:10:14,908 --> 01:10:16,460
Have you lived here long?

615
01:10:16,510 --> 01:10:18,959
Born and raised.
Only Doctor on the island.

616
01:10:19,009 --> 01:10:21,508
Then you know the Morgans,
and their daughter?

617
01:10:23,809 --> 01:10:24,959
Do you know their daughter?

618
01:10:25,009 --> 01:10:26,808
Do you know their daughter?

619
01:10:29,807 --> 01:10:31,507
What's this about?

620
01:10:31,907 --> 01:10:36,556
Look, I'm sorry. I don't know how to
say this, but I'm seeing things in

621
01:10:36,906 --> 01:10:39,805
my head, images, and
so is my son.

622
01:10:40,806 --> 01:10:43,606
My son, that's why I'm here.

623
01:10:44,305 --> 01:10:48,004
And somehow, I don't know how, but

624
01:10:48,605 --> 01:10:50,605
it's because of that girl.

625
01:10:54,404 --> 01:10:57,104
Haven't heard anybody say
that in a long time.

626
01:11:00,502 --> 01:11:02,853
They wanted a child
more than anything.

627
01:11:02,903 --> 01:11:04,403
Poor Anna

628
01:11:04,801 --> 01:11:08,302
They tried hard for years. But
sometimes it's just not meant to be.

629
01:11:09,102 --> 01:11:11,251
Then one winter they went away.

630
01:11:11,301 --> 01:11:13,802
When they came back,
it was with Samara.

631
01:11:14,701 --> 01:11:18,550
'Adopted' they said.
Never did say from where.

632
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:21,001
Said the mother had died
of complications.

633
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:23,552
But they had their baby,
they had their horses,

634
01:11:23,601 --> 01:11:25,299
everything was fine.

635
01:11:25,699 --> 01:11:27,800
Till Anna started
coming to see me.

636
01:11:28,700 --> 01:11:30,849
Said she was suffering visions.

637
01:11:30,898 --> 01:11:32,848
seeing things

638
01:11:32,899 --> 01:11:34,699
horrible things

639
01:11:34,898 --> 01:11:37,398
like they've been burned
inside her

640
01:11:38,098 --> 01:11:40,498
And it only happened
around Samara,

641
01:11:41,298 --> 01:11:43,397
that the girl put them there.

642
01:11:44,947 --> 01:11:46,996
Were you Samara's doctor, too?

643
01:11:48,398 --> 01:11:50,395
Was there anything
wrong with her?

644
01:11:50,695 --> 01:11:52,397
You mean medically?

645
01:11:52,596 --> 01:11:54,595
I mean whatever you mean.

646
01:11:57,196 --> 01:11:59,195
When Darby there was born

647
01:12:01,495 --> 01:12:04,094
we knew something wasn't
right with him,

648
01:12:04,593 --> 01:12:07,095
but we loved him anyway.

649
01:12:08,592 --> 01:12:10,393
Takes work, you know

650
01:12:10,493 --> 01:12:12,493
Some people have limits.

651
01:12:15,391 --> 01:12:17,191
So what happened to her?

652
01:12:18,792 --> 01:12:21,992
I referred them to Eola
Psychiatric on the mainland.

653
01:12:22,290 --> 01:12:24,191
I assume she's still there.

654
01:12:24,492 --> 01:12:26,191
You don't know?

655
01:12:27,190 --> 01:12:29,090
How can you not know?

656
01:12:30,391 --> 01:12:32,089
We've been through

657
01:12:32,291 --> 01:12:34,489
a lot of hard years out here.

658
01:12:36,090 --> 01:12:37,689
mean winters

659
01:12:38,390 --> 01:12:40,789
small hauls, no fish

660
01:12:41,487 --> 01:12:43,989
And that was long
before the horses.

661
01:12:44,889 --> 01:12:47,238
See, when you live on an
island, and you catch a cold,

662
01:12:47,287 --> 01:12:48,989
it's everybody's cold.

663
01:12:49,788 --> 01:12:52,588
No offense, ma'am, but what
the hell does that mean?

664
01:12:53,686 --> 01:12:55,887
It means, ever since that
girl's been gone,

665
01:12:55,937 --> 01:12:57,637
things have been better.

666
01:13:03,136 --> 01:13:04,937
Man, you really going
back in time here.

667
01:13:04,986 --> 01:13:06,835
Yeah, the lady at the reception
said it should still be here.

668
01:13:06,886 --> 01:13:08,235
Should be?

669
01:13:08,285 --> 01:13:10,334
You say you were the
patient's father, right?

670
01:13:10,385 --> 01:13:12,234
Yep! Richard Morgan, that's me.

671
01:13:12,283 --> 01:13:13,985
What is your secret?

672
01:13:14,035 --> 01:13:15,334
Diet and exercise, man

673
01:13:15,384 --> 01:13:16,583
No shooot!

674
01:13:17,184 --> 01:13:18,584
It's all it takes.

675
01:13:19,583 --> 01:13:21,983
You know, I'm not an idiot.

676
01:13:22,184 --> 01:13:24,384
You try and walk out
of here with my file,

677
01:13:24,435 --> 01:13:26,632
and I'll be your new,
like white on your eyes.

678
01:13:26,682 --> 01:13:29,682
You understand?
Yeah, man...I just wanna watch it.

679
01:13:31,282 --> 01:13:33,682
I'm responsible for every
file-tape in here.

680
01:13:34,182 --> 01:13:35,882
I have a system.

681
01:13:36,182 --> 01:13:38,581
And I don't want anyone
disarranging it.

682
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:41,080
I'd never

683
01:13:41,180 --> 01:13:42,581
disarrange

684
01:13:44,379 --> 01:13:46,379
Long as we understand each other.

685
01:13:48,380 --> 01:13:49,980
Ok, now I'm mad!

686
01:13:51,378 --> 01:13:53,480
Does it say who's the
last person watched it?

687
01:13:56,580 --> 01:13:57,479
Yeah

688
01:13:58,178 --> 01:13:59,878
It was you.

689
01:14:01,778 --> 01:14:02,978
Come on! Come on!

690
01:14:06,076 --> 01:14:09,775
Who you need to call, is not
responding, or is outside your area.

691
01:14:09,876 --> 01:14:11,776
You piece of shooot.

692
01:14:14,876 --> 01:14:16,276
Come on, Rachel

693
01:14:29,174 --> 01:14:30,173
Hello?

694
01:14:37,772 --> 01:14:38,873
Mr. Morgan?

695
01:14:51,770 --> 01:14:52,871
Mr. Morgan?

696
01:15:49,763 --> 01:15:51,761
Certificate Of Live Birth

697
01:15:52,062 --> 01:15:53,263
Morgan

698
01:15:55,262 --> 01:15:56,462
Samara

699
01:16:09,359 --> 01:16:10,759
#SM 0015

700
01:16:29,157 --> 01:16:33,106
This is SM 0015,
Samara Morgan

701
01:16:33,156 --> 01:16:34,356
hour 14

702
01:16:38,255 --> 01:16:39,456
good, very good

703
01:16:39,956 --> 01:16:42,455
So what is it that's
keeping you awake?

704
01:16:43,655 --> 01:16:45,755
You must sleep some time?

705
01:16:47,255 --> 01:16:49,354
You dream about something?

706
01:16:51,455 --> 01:16:52,653
Samara?

707
01:16:57,353 --> 01:16:59,153
Let's talk about the pictures?

708
01:17:01,652 --> 01:17:03,451
How did you make them?

709
01:17:06,951 --> 01:17:08,151
Samara?

710
01:17:09,552 --> 01:17:11,652
How did you make these
pictures?

711
01:17:14,151 --> 01:17:15,651
I don't

712
01:17:17,050 --> 01:17:18,552
make them.

713
01:17:19,551 --> 01:17:21,449
I see them.

714
01:17:22,250 --> 01:17:23,750
Then

715
01:17:24,250 --> 01:17:25,749
they just

716
01:17:27,049 --> 01:17:28,448
are.

717
01:17:28,648 --> 01:17:29,699
Samara?

718
01:17:29,749 --> 01:17:32,950
I need you to start telling
me the truth, okay?

719
01:17:33,748 --> 01:17:35,746
Can I see my mummy?

720
01:17:35,997 --> 01:17:39,498
No, Samara. Not until we understand
what's wrong with you.

721
01:17:41,447 --> 01:17:43,147
I love my mummy.

722
01:17:43,347 --> 01:17:44,848
Yes, you do.

723
01:17:45,996 --> 01:17:48,546
But you don't want to hurt
her anymore, now do you?

724
01:17:50,045 --> 01:17:51,747
You don't want to hurt anyone?

725
01:17:53,946 --> 01:17:56,745
But I do. And I'm sorry.

726
01:17:58,446 --> 01:18:00,244
It won't stop.

727
01:18:00,444 --> 01:18:02,445
Well, that's why you're here.

728
01:18:02,794 --> 01:18:05,244
So that I can help you
to make it stop.

729
01:18:07,593 --> 01:18:09,543
He's going to meet me here.

730
01:18:10,142 --> 01:18:11,142
Who?

731
01:18:12,243 --> 01:18:13,443
Daddy

732
01:18:14,842 --> 01:18:16,743
They just wanna help you.

733
01:18:17,042 --> 01:18:18,542
Not daddy

734
01:18:20,042 --> 01:18:21,741
Your daddy loves you.

735
01:18:23,092 --> 01:18:25,340
Daddy loves the horses.

736
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:30,241
He want me to go away.

737
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:33,339
No, he doesn't.

738
01:18:34,790 --> 01:18:36,891
But he doesn't know.

739
01:18:37,239 --> 01:18:38,939
He doesn't know what?

740
01:18:40,339 --> 01:18:41,538
Samara?

741
01:18:46,038 --> 01:18:48,538
She's never gonna whisper
in the videocamera again!

742
01:18:50,236 --> 01:18:52,038
What did you do to her?!

743
01:18:56,736 --> 01:18:58,536
She was your daughter!

744
01:19:03,335 --> 01:19:06,086
You killed Samara, didn't you?!
You killed her, and when your wife...

745
01:19:06,136 --> 01:19:08,935
My wife was not
supposed to have a child!

746
01:19:18,433 --> 01:19:19,634
Mr. Morgan?!

747
01:19:21,533 --> 01:19:22,132
What are you doing?

748
01:19:22,182 --> 01:19:25,133
Whispers. You can hear them
all the time, at night,

749
01:19:25,734 --> 01:19:27,183
in your sleep,

750
01:19:27,232 --> 01:19:28,682
even the damn horses

751
01:19:28,732 --> 01:19:29,983
Mr. Morgan, come out of there!

752
01:19:30,033 --> 01:19:31,232
Those twitches

753
01:19:32,231 --> 01:19:33,432
Oh, Christ

754
01:19:34,232 --> 01:19:35,930
These things she'll show you.

755
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:37,731
She's still showing them.

756
01:19:37,782 --> 01:19:39,481
This will never stop.

757
01:19:40,331 --> 01:19:42,530
Your coming here proves that.

758
01:19:44,631 --> 01:19:46,880
Where is she?
Please

759
01:19:47,229 --> 01:19:50,029
I have to stop her,
if I don't, my son will die!

760
01:19:50,429 --> 01:19:53,629
Oh yes, he will.

761
01:19:54,729 --> 01:19:56,178
She never sleeps.

762
01:19:56,229 --> 01:19:57,928
Wait. No.

763
01:20:08,326 --> 01:20:09,327
Rachel!

764
01:20:11,926 --> 01:20:13,626
It's ok. It's ok.

765
01:20:16,225 --> 01:20:17,325
You're ok

766
01:20:19,424 --> 01:20:20,526
You ok?

767
01:20:29,523 --> 01:20:30,724
Oh, Jesus

768
01:20:46,371 --> 01:20:48,171
She doesn't like the barn.

769
01:20:50,321 --> 01:20:52,121
The horses keep her up at night.

770
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:00,719
She doesn't like the barn.

771
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:02,320
What?

772
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:05,719
The horses keep her awake.

773
01:21:38,714 --> 01:21:40,015
Samara

774
01:22:17,609 --> 01:22:19,707
He kept her here.

775
01:22:21,907 --> 01:22:24,209
Her mother was going crazy.

776
01:22:25,907 --> 01:22:28,008
Morgan blamed the child.

777
01:22:29,406 --> 01:22:31,108
So he kept her here.

778
01:22:33,907 --> 01:22:35,406
Alone

779
01:22:36,505 --> 01:22:37,957
Not alone

780
01:23:08,352 --> 01:23:09,602
Rachel

781
01:23:13,900 --> 01:23:16,001
There's something under here.

782
01:23:24,499 --> 01:23:27,098
It looks like it's etched
into the wood.

783
01:23:32,497 --> 01:23:34,298
or burned

784
01:24:02,043 --> 01:24:04,344
I've seen this tree before.

785
01:24:04,994 --> 01:24:06,694
Yeah, it was on the tape.

786
01:24:06,944 --> 01:24:08,094
No

787
01:24:08,692 --> 01:24:10,393
I've been there.

788
01:24:13,794 --> 01:24:15,591
Shelter Mountain

789
01:24:46,289 --> 01:24:50,387
The sun came through the leaves,
lit them up like it was on fire.

790
01:24:52,388 --> 01:24:54,387
right at sunset

791
01:24:57,887 --> 01:25:00,586
right when I watched the tape.

792
01:25:06,234 --> 01:25:08,086
That was a week ago.

793
01:25:16,483 --> 01:25:18,684
Back to where we started from.

794
01:25:19,132 --> 01:25:22,084
Something led us here, the
tree, the drawing, the wall

795
01:25:22,133 --> 01:25:23,932
It doesn't matter,

796
01:25:24,983 --> 01:25:26,832
we're too late.

797
01:25:29,383 --> 01:25:31,283
You have to help him.

798
01:25:31,483 --> 01:25:32,931
What are you talking about?

799
01:25:32,980 --> 01:25:34,281
Aidan

800
01:25:35,382 --> 01:25:38,731
It's up to you now, just use the time
you have, and figure something out.

801
01:25:38,780 --> 01:25:40,880
We're gonna figure this out
together, right now!

802
01:25:40,930 --> 01:25:44,329
It's too late, Noah...! Stop it, okay?
There's a reason that we're here!

803
01:25:44,379 --> 01:25:44,729
What?!

804
01:25:44,779 --> 01:25:49,679
I don't know, okay? There's something
in this room...I mean, it's in this phone,

805
01:25:49,730 --> 01:25:51,828
in this television

806
01:25:51,878 --> 01:25:54,729
Come on!
Kill us now, why don't you!?

807
01:25:56,479 --> 01:25:57,828
Noah

808
01:25:59,577 --> 01:26:00,729
look

809
01:27:42,363 --> 01:27:43,863
Jesus

810
01:27:44,763 --> 01:27:46,664
How far down you think it goes?

811
01:27:46,713 --> 01:27:48,563
I can't see anything.

812
01:27:58,910 --> 01:28:00,761
No, we should drop something.

813
01:28:37,655 --> 01:28:40,356
You think she's down there?
Shhhhh!

814
01:29:09,050 --> 01:29:10,550
RACHEL!!!

815
01:29:38,747 --> 01:29:40,247
RACHEL?!

816
01:29:42,945 --> 01:29:44,447
RACHEL?!

817
01:29:45,246 --> 01:29:46,896
I'm here!

818
01:29:47,545 --> 01:29:49,145
I'm alright!

819
01:29:50,096 --> 01:29:51,446
I think

820
01:29:51,646 --> 01:29:54,595
Can I gonna go find
something to get you out?!

821
01:29:55,245 --> 01:29:56,845
Hurry!

822
01:30:42,039 --> 01:30:43,089
Noah?

823
01:30:52,386 --> 01:30:53,637
Noah?

824
01:30:54,438 --> 01:30:56,037
NOAH!!!

825
01:31:02,836 --> 01:31:04,235
NOOO!

826
01:31:58,728 --> 01:32:00,926
Isn't it beautiful here, Samara?

827
01:32:05,328 --> 01:32:06,726
so peaceful

828
01:32:10,576 --> 01:32:12,726
I know things will get better.

829
01:32:24,025 --> 01:32:26,924
All I ever wanted was you.

830
01:33:08,318 --> 01:33:11,018
She was still alive.

831
01:33:48,962 --> 01:33:50,811
It's okay now.

832
01:33:52,213 --> 01:33:53,711
it's ok

833
01:33:56,112 --> 01:33:57,912
Rachel!!!

834
01:34:01,709 --> 01:34:04,359
We got a sunset!

835
01:34:06,211 --> 01:34:09,910
The sun is set, time
sunset, do you hear me?

836
01:34:10,509 --> 01:34:12,759
It's time sunset!

837
01:34:17,307 --> 01:34:18,908
Rachel?!

838
01:34:36,106 --> 01:34:38,406
Rachel, are you there?!

839
01:34:44,005 --> 01:34:45,406
I'm here.

840
01:35:03,052 --> 01:35:05,201
They're gonna bury her next week.

841
01:35:08,802 --> 01:35:10,301
It's over.

842
01:35:17,900 --> 01:35:19,300
Are you okay?

843
01:35:20,899 --> 01:35:24,648
She wanted that child more
than anything in the world.

844
01:35:26,199 --> 01:35:28,349
How could she have done that?

845
01:35:32,398 --> 01:35:34,998
She just wanted to be heard.

846
01:35:38,197 --> 01:35:40,496
Sometimes children

847
01:35:41,396 --> 01:35:45,396
yell, or cry, or draw pictures.

848
01:35:59,395 --> 01:36:01,243
I'm gonna go home.

849
01:36:16,791 --> 01:36:21,192
I can't imagine what it's like down
a well, all alone like that.

850
01:36:21,991 --> 01:36:24,291
How long can you survive?

851
01:36:30,790 --> 01:36:32,790
7 days

852
01:36:39,089 --> 01:36:42,188
You could survive for 7 days.

853
01:37:51,378 --> 01:37:53,079
Just call me sometime.

854
01:37:54,228 --> 01:37:56,228
Unless you're in your movie.

855
01:37:58,876 --> 01:38:00,427
Call me tomorrow.

856
01:38:05,276 --> 01:38:07,028
and the day after that

857
01:38:48,570 --> 01:38:49,971
Rachel?

858
01:38:53,971 --> 01:38:55,569
What time is it?

859
01:38:56,770 --> 01:39:01,418
It's either really late, or really early,
depending on how you look at it.

860
01:39:03,067 --> 01:39:05,219
Don't you have to be at work?

861
01:39:06,568 --> 01:39:08,367
Not today

862
01:39:12,967 --> 01:39:15,067
What happened to the girl?

863
01:39:16,016 --> 01:39:17,215
Samara?

864
01:39:18,167 --> 01:39:20,665
Is that her name?
Mhmm.

865
01:39:21,065 --> 01:39:23,216
Is she still in the dark place?

866
01:39:23,815 --> 01:39:24,916
No

867
01:39:26,065 --> 01:39:27,864
We set her free.

868
01:39:29,765 --> 01:39:31,214
You helped her?

869
01:39:31,664 --> 01:39:32,914
Yeah

870
01:39:33,514 --> 01:39:35,613
Why did you do that?

871
01:39:37,763 --> 01:39:39,014
What's wrong, honey?

872
01:39:39,064 --> 01:39:41,063
You weren't supposed to help her.

873
01:39:41,362 --> 01:39:43,014
It's okay now.

874
01:39:43,064 --> 01:39:45,212
She's not gonna hurt you.

875
01:39:45,262 --> 01:39:46,663
She's

876
01:39:52,461 --> 01:39:54,761
Don't you understand, Rachel?

877
01:39:56,962 --> 01:39:59,059
She never sleeps.

878
01:40:56,253 --> 01:40:58,502
Pick up the phone, Noah.

879
01:40:59,653 --> 01:41:01,603
Come on, pick up.

880
01:41:49,145 --> 01:41:53,245
Come on, Noah!
Pick up the goddamn phone!

881
01:42:58,036 --> 01:42:59,336
Come on!

882
01:44:47,320 --> 01:44:50,621
Go to your room! Now!

883
01:44:56,620 --> 01:44:59,519
What do you want?
What do you want!?

884
01:45:00,119 --> 01:45:02,718
What do you want from me!?

885
01:45:20,716 --> 01:45:22,814
Why not me?

886
01:45:24,816 --> 01:45:27,966
What did I do they didn't?

887
01:45:59,611 --> 01:46:02,310
She just wanted to be heard.

888
01:46:04,210 --> 01:46:06,160
He want me to go away.

889
01:46:06,210 --> 01:46:08,858
My wife was not supposed
to have a child!

890
01:46:08,909 --> 01:46:10,508
All I ever wanted was you.

891
01:46:10,559 --> 01:46:12,209
Don't you understand, Rachel?

892
01:46:12,258 --> 01:46:14,160
But he doesn't know.

893
01:46:14,209 --> 01:46:15,758
She never sleeps.

894
01:46:15,808 --> 01:46:19,659
You take one person's tragedy,
and force the world to experience it.

895
01:46:20,109 --> 01:46:21,957
You spread it like sickness.

896
01:46:22,406 --> 01:46:24,506
You don't wanna hurt anyone?

897
01:46:24,807 --> 01:46:26,456
But I do.

898
01:46:27,607 --> 01:46:29,255
And I'm sorry.

899
01:46:30,856 --> 01:46:33,106
It won't stop.

900
01:46:37,304 --> 01:46:39,456
I made a copy.

901
01:46:41,655 --> 01:46:43,305
Push it in.

902
01:46:46,005 --> 01:46:47,604
Push

903
01:46:54,802 --> 01:46:57,403
It's going to keep going, isn't it?

904
01:46:58,401 --> 01:47:00,252
She'll never stop.

905
01:47:01,102 --> 01:47:02,953
Don't worry, sweetie.

906
01:47:03,002 --> 01:47:05,002
You're gonna be okay.

907
01:47:11,201 --> 01:47:13,551
But what about the person
we show it to?
