1
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:29,188
Why isn't this
stupid thing workin'?

2
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:30,621
See, that's that bullshit.

3
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:32,091
I'm taking this shit
right back to Best Buy.

4
00:01:33,692 --> 00:01:35,259
Or not.

5
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:37,096
Stupid lens cap.

6
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,097
Wow!

7
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,231
Brand-new camera.

8
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:42,366
I'm filming
everything with this.

9
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:45,471
Christmas, New Year's,
vagina.

10
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:49,373
All right.
Today is the big day.

11
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:51,576
My girlfriend
Kisha's moving in.

12
00:01:51,579 --> 00:01:53,611
Now, all my boys
keep telling me,
"Don't do it, don't do it,

13
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:55,646
"because everything's
gonna change.

14
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:57,149
"She's gonna take
over your house.

15
00:01:57,151 --> 00:01:58,182
"She's never
gonna cook again.

16
00:01:58,185 --> 00:01:59,551
"And worst of all,

17
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,787
"you're putting
your dick in jail."

18
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:03,454
I think they're trippin'.

19
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:06,224
Once she moves in,
everything's gonna
be perfect.

20
00:02:06,227 --> 00:02:07,725
Place looks nice.

21
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:09,527
Baby boy cleaned up
for you, huh?

22
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,295
Oh, shit!

23
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:12,663
Rosa!

24
00:02:14,235 --> 00:02:15,834
Hey, you gotta
announce yourself.

25
00:02:15,836 --> 00:02:17,735
You can't just
creep up on me.

26
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:19,538
Aw, come on.
This is my
housekeeper, Rosa.

27
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:21,806
Say hi. Say hi.
Say hi!

28
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,641
Hi!  <i>Hola.</i>
<i>Say </i> <i>"Hola." Hola.</i>

29
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:24,776
Bye-bye!

30
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:30,248
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay!

31
00:02:30,251 --> 00:02:32,216
Do this.
Oh!

32
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:33,618
I'm a big  <i>bambino?</i>

33
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:38,456
You know I love you.

34
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:41,192
Hey, Shiloh!
Say hi to Mommy.

35
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:43,728
I'm gonna hump you
on your leg, Kisha.
That's right.

36
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,364
And I'm gonna lick you
all over your face

37
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:47,432
with my dog-ball mouth.

38
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:50,602
Oh, shit.
Here she comes.

39
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:51,736
Hi, baby!

40
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:52,937
Hey, baby! Hi!

41
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:56,341
No, no, Shiloh!
Wait! No, no, no, no!

42
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:58,276
Shiloh! What did you do?

43
00:02:58,278 --> 00:02:59,645
I didn't see him!
What did you do?

44
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:00,711
I'm so sorry.

45
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:02,713
Oh, my God!

46
00:03:03,682 --> 00:03:04,750
Shiloh, come on, breathe.

47
00:03:04,752 --> 00:03:05,850
Maybe he's
just playing dead.

48
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:07,919
He doesn't know
how to play dead.

49
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:10,421
He knows how to shake hands.
He knows how to fetch.

50
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:12,490
He knows how to roll over.

51
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:13,491
He don't know
how to play dead.

52
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:15,193
Come on, Shiloh, breathe.

53
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,329
One, two, three.
Breathe.

54
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,330
Aww!

55
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:20,865
Give me
the jumper cables.
The jumper cables?

56
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,235
Give me
the goddamn jumper cables!

57
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:24,802
Don't you die on me!

58
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:26,972
Start the car!

59
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:28,873
Clear! Go!

60
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:30,308
Oh, shit!

61
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:34,947
Meet me at the hospital!

62
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:39,651
The hospital's that way!

63
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:40,885
Don't go towards
the light, Shiloh!

64
00:03:44,456 --> 00:03:46,425
You're in
a better place now, buddy.

65
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:47,893
I'm so, so sorry.

66
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:50,596
It's okay, baby.

67
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:53,432
It's...
It's not your fault.
Yes, it is.

68
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:56,268
You know, look...
Look on the bright side.

69
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,236
I'm allergic to dogs.

70
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,538
I know, but that's what
was so great about Shiloh.

71
00:04:01,807 --> 00:04:03,808
He was hypoallergenic.

72
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:07,746
Shiloh!

73
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:23,728
Oh, my God!
Look at all this shit.

74
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,365
Okay, Malcolm,
this is the last box.

75
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:29,000
What's with the camera?

76
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:30,502
I'm documenting
our lives together.

77
00:04:30,504 --> 00:04:31,603
Say hi.

78
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:34,639
Hi! Okay. Mmm.

79
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:36,441
That ass
lookin' nice, baby.

80
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,709
Hey, hey.
Pan up, pan up.
I see that.

81
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:40,579
Baby, you are officially
a hoarder.

82
00:04:40,581 --> 00:04:42,480
I swear to God, I'm gonna
open one of these boxes

83
00:04:42,483 --> 00:04:44,750
and find, like, a dead cat
and an old
baloney sandwich in it.

84
00:04:44,752 --> 00:04:46,550
Ha, ha, ha.
Very funny.

85
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:48,653
Oh, my God.
Do you need these?

86
00:04:48,656 --> 00:04:49,954
Yes! These are...
For what?

87
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,956
These are good
wedding shoes!

88
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:54,526
One to 10, what are you
feeling right now about that?

89
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:56,927
Um, 8.7.

90
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,930
What do you
feel about that?
Nine. Nine.

91
00:04:58,932 --> 00:05:02,300
No, wait! Come on. Come on.
What's this? Hold on.

92
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,836
This is a box that my aunt
brought from Kenya.

93
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:07,605
This is a nine, too.

94
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:08,973
Oh, my God!

95
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:12,610
Hi, my name is Kisha Davis,
and I'm a hoarder.

96
00:05:15,814 --> 00:05:17,081
There's shame.

97
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:20,718
Oh, wow.

98
00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:22,821
Are these
your daddy's ashes?

99
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,423
Yes, Malcolm.
They go where I go.

100
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:27,992
So, we're gonna
have his ghost
watching over us?

101
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:32,697
Just put him in
the other room.
He likes to watch TV.

102
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:33,865
He's dead.
What's he gonna watch?

103
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:35,433
<i>American Horror Story?</i>

104
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:39,103
Okay, babe,
these video games,
they have to go.

105
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:40,738
Wait. Leave my
video games alone.
They're tacky.

106
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:45,843
- I'm not gonna break it.
- Give me my camera!

107
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:54,586
<i>"Negra?"</i>Did she
just call me a nigger?

108
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:56,521
What? What?

109
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,090
I will lambada your ass!

110
00:05:58,091 --> 00:05:59,591
English! English!
Speak English!

111
00:05:59,593 --> 00:06:00,858
Baby. Baby. Baby!

112
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,860
You know she
don't like me, right?

113
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,096
Oh, I know
what's going on here.

114
00:06:04,098 --> 00:06:07,766
You got some
Schwarzenegger stuff
going on in here, right?

115
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:09,701
Really?
Yeah, okay, yeah.

116
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:14,473
Yeah, we're gonna
have a nappy-haired baby
that speaks perfect Spanish.

117
00:06:14,475 --> 00:06:15,906
Come on.
Think about it.
 Okay.

118
00:06:17,476 --> 00:06:19,110
Mmm.

119
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:21,112
Mmm.

120
00:06:21,115 --> 00:06:23,081
Hungry there, buddy?
Mm-hmm.

121
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:24,783
You're over there eating
like the Cookie Monster.

122
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:28,519
Can I just enjoy
my food, please?

123
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:30,622
Wow. Somebody's crabby.

124
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,492
I'm sorry.
I'm just tired.

125
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:37,762
I haven't been sleeping well.
I keep hearing these noises.

126
00:06:38,497 --> 00:06:40,031
Scary.

127
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:42,834
Well, you don't have
to be afraid, okay?

128
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:44,735
'Cause you're
living with me now.

129
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:46,971
And nobody's gonna
hurt you on my watch.

130
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:48,406
Okay?
Okay.

131
00:06:51,877 --> 00:06:53,845
Unless the nigger
got a gun.

132
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:55,514
Then you on your own.

133
00:06:58,483 --> 00:06:59,550
What?

134
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:04,456
Hey, baby, what you doin'?

135
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:07,858
Well, it's time to
put on something
a little more comfortable.

136
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,827
Aha! That's what
I'm talkin' about!

137
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,630
Fellas,
get out your pen and pads.

138
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:15,466
We about to give
you a sex tutorial.
Let's do this.

139
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:30,949
Mmm. Oh.

140
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,716
Yeah.

141
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,620
Oh, you got the beat!

142
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,055
Oh! Stop.

143
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:38,757
Stop. Not yet. Not... Ahh!

144
00:07:41,762 --> 00:07:43,562
You gonna bring
a friend there, huh?

145
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:45,197
Ah. Ah.

146
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,598
Uh-huh? Watch that.
Uh-huh.

147
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,935
Now you get some, yeah.
Watch. Watch.

148
00:07:49,937 --> 00:07:51,002
Ah, taste that.

149
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:53,170
Look at Daddy. Uh-huh.

150
00:07:55,576 --> 00:07:57,709
Two dogs, one duck.

151
00:07:57,711 --> 00:07:58,810
Get it nasty.
You nasty.

152
00:08:01,947 --> 00:08:03,581
Go home.

153
00:08:03,584 --> 00:08:05,684
I want you by myself. Yeah.

154
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:08,552
Shh.

155
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:10,187
Oh. Oh, shit!
That's still hot!

156
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:12,790
Shut up. Take it.
You just take it.

157
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:17,629
Take it, take it, take it.

158
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,730
Baby!
Yeah, baby?

159
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:23,869
I cannot believe
this is our first night
living together!

160
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,870
Yeah. It's nice, huh?
Uh-huh.

161
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:27,771
I can't wait to
lie next to you.

162
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:30,040
Oh, me, too.
Gotta go, baby.

163
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:31,610
It was fun.

164
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,615
Whoo!

165
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:38,149
Get in.

166
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,283
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

167
00:08:39,286 --> 00:08:40,585
Here I come!

168
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:41,519
Okay, honey.

169
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:49,126
Baby, you are
the sexiest woman...

170
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:51,763
What the hell?

171
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:55,767
You know, Malcolm,
not everybody goes to bed
looking like a supermodel.

172
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:57,769
Apparently not.
You know?

173
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,303
Besides,
what is wrong
with my outfit?

174
00:08:59,306 --> 00:09:01,239
Nothin',
if you lived in a box
underneath the freeway.

175
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,941
What?

176
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:04,842
Come on!
Hold the sign up,
please?

177
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,279
Can I go to bed?

178
00:09:08,282 --> 00:09:09,714
No, you gotta
get the joke first!

179
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:10,815
Come on.

180
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:11,950
All right.
Okay, fine.

181
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:13,118
Okay. I'm ready.

182
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,952
All right. Go ahead.

183
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:16,855
Spare change?

184
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:18,590
You stupid!

185
00:09:32,938 --> 00:09:35,240
I love you.
Good night.

186
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:56,628
God!

187
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:04,702
How could someone
so cute be so stink?

188
00:10:04,705 --> 00:10:06,738
Oh, Jesus Christ!

189
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:13,077
Oh, really?
Oh, God!

190
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:16,280
What crawled up
your ass and died?

191
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:17,682
Shit!

192
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:19,350
Really?

193
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:20,951
You ain't
allowed to move in here
and do this shit.

194
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,052
Mm-mmm.

195
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:23,822
Mm-mmm.

196
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:25,356
Ugh!

197
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:27,658
Aah!

198
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:30,928
It's alive! What?

199
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,033
Oh! Oh! Oh, fuck!

200
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:37,769
Oh!

201
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,370
I heard that.

202
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:46,144
So, we didn't
have sex last night.

203
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:49,813
Kisha didn't cook,
and she killed my dog.

204
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:52,149
But other than that,

205
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,719
I guess this moving-in thing
is gonna be pretty cool.

206
00:10:56,688 --> 00:10:59,423
Malcolm! Malcolm!

207
00:10:59,426 --> 00:11:00,859
What's up?

208
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,695
My keys are on the floor.

209
00:11:03,697 --> 00:11:04,863
Okay.

210
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:06,331
Malcolm.
What?

211
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,365
Something weird
is going on here.

212
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:10,100
If you mean
something weird

213
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:11,735
like you farting
in your sleep,
yes, there is.

214
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:13,804
No, no.

215
00:11:13,807 --> 00:11:14,739
I think we have a ghost.

216
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,041
A ghost?

217
00:11:16,043 --> 00:11:18,809
Yeah, okay.
No, you have a ghost
in your ass.

218
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:22,947
I wanna bring a psychic
to tell us what's going on.

219
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:24,081
A psychic?

220
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,783
Ah, come on, Kish.
That's ridiculous.

221
00:11:25,786 --> 00:11:27,451
Look, I'll tell you
what's going on, okay?

222
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:29,287
Some neighborhood kid
came in here,

223
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:31,121
stole something
out of your purse,
and then he left...

224
00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:34,125
No. See, if anyone
is stealing anything,

225
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:36,193
it is you-know-who, okay?

226
00:11:38,163 --> 00:11:40,999
Hey, girl!

227
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,201
Okay, we have no idea
what she's doing
when we're not here.

228
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,705
Why is she
always wearing gloves?

229
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,038
Okay, fine.
I'll take care of it.

230
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,106
Guilty.

231
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:52,844
Hey, I'm Dan
the Security Man.

232
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:54,144
Hey, how you doin'?
Nice to meet you.

233
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:57,414
Hey, I'm sorry, buddy.
I didn't see you back there.

234
00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:59,417
That's my associate, Bob.
Actually, he's my brother.

235
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:00,884
He's a simple...

236
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:04,154
He used to
play in the dryer.
We turned it on once.

237
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:07,292
Whoa, whoa!

238
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:08,759
Hey, yo,
you better back up!

239
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:09,860
What's the problem?

240
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:11,162
We're here to
install cameras.

241
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:13,030
Yeah.
Not to be filmed
on camera.

242
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:14,164
'Cause I'm doing
my own reality show.

243
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:15,500
Well, I'm not
signing anything.

244
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:17,368
And I can't write.
He can't write.

245
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,769
Blur this out.

246
00:12:19,437 --> 00:12:21,172
Mosaic.
Okay.

247
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:22,841
What is he doing?

248
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:24,475
Is the owner home?

249
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:25,943
You're talking to him.

250
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:27,946
Yeah, right!

251
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:29,047
Wow.

252
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:31,950
Oh. Wow. Okay.

253
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:34,485
All right. Now, that camera
covers your entire backyard.

254
00:12:34,488 --> 00:12:36,386
It's cool.

255
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:38,389
Let's say you and the missus
are having
a pool party, right?

256
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,158
You know, you're grilling up
some fried chicken,

257
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:43,360
probably some ribs.

258
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:45,462
Hot wings,
some pig knuckle,

259
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:46,865
strimps.

260
00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:50,235
You know,
maybe some corn bread.

261
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:53,171
I'd say watermelon,
but that might
be racist, right?

262
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:55,306
Corn bread was
pretty close.

263
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:57,942
Not really.
Country folks
eat corn bread.

264
00:12:58,543 --> 00:13:00,345
Can I say it?

265
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:01,913
You talking
about the "N" word?
Yeah.

266
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:03,114
No. It's not appropriate.

267
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,414
I see.

268
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:05,917
Are you...
Is he serious?

269
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:07,451
You can call me
a cracker.

270
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:10,053
I don't want to.
I just want...

271
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:11,288
Let me say it.

272
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:15,860
If you say it, I'm going to
punch you in your face.

273
00:13:19,197 --> 00:13:20,331
Anyway...
Wow.

274
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:22,366
Maybe later things
get a little freaky.

275
00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:25,937
You and the
old lady in the 'cuzzi,
buck naked, right?

276
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:28,173
Little Black Mamba's
ready to strike.

277
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:30,508
That camera will
catch all of it.

278
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:32,509
Nice!
So, all you gotta do,
go upstairs,

279
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:36,213
clickity-clack
on the computer,
beat off to the highlights.

280
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:37,849
Yeah.

281
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,417
Holler!

282
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:41,451
Holler!

283
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:44,522
Do it.
No.

284
00:13:44,524 --> 00:13:46,256
Holler!

285
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:48,058
Are you really gonna
make me do this here?

286
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:49,126
Camera Guys.

287
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:51,261
Holler!

288
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:54,097
Got you all tied in.
Mm-hmm.

289
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,267
Uh, just hit
the space bar, the mouse,
you flash from the kitchen.

290
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:57,368
Mm-hmm?

291
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,436
Entryway.

292
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:00,437
Backyard.
Living room.

293
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,173
I even tied in the webcam.
Nice.

294
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,241
Yeah.
Oh, I like that.
That's cool.

295
00:14:04,244 --> 00:14:05,976
Here's something
you wanna think about.

296
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:08,312
You can remote
access these things
from wherever you are.

297
00:14:08,315 --> 00:14:11,081
I can set that up if you want.
Just give me your pass code.

298
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,083
No. Not gonna happen.

299
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:14,619
Good choice.
Nice try.

300
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,421
But you could set that up
if you want to.

301
00:14:16,423 --> 00:14:18,088
You're out of town
on a business trip,

302
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:19,224
you might wanna
check up on the missus,

303
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:20,490
make sure she's safe.

304
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:22,059
Right.

305
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:23,494
Or whatever she's doing!
Yeah.

306
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:25,462
You know,
girls, they like to have

307
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:28,298
a girls' time when
you're out of town.

308
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:29,533
And why wouldn't they,
you know?

309
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:32,437
You don't
expect things like...

310
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:35,505
You know, she's
spread eagle on the floor,
banging the mailman.

311
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:37,274
"Special delivery!"

312
00:14:37,277 --> 00:14:38,475
Not on our bed!

313
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:41,379
You dirty bird!

314
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,147
In front of the dog!
Is he serious?

315
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:45,383
Oh, the dog's so upset!

316
00:14:45,884 --> 00:14:47,619
I mean, you know,

317
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,488
you're at a security
convention in Albuquerque

318
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:53,191
screaming at the top of
your lungs at a Quality Inn!

319
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:54,658
I remember Albuquerque.

320
00:14:54,661 --> 00:14:58,296
You can't scratch your way
through the camera!

321
00:14:58,298 --> 00:15:00,465
Kinda reminds me,
I gotta mail out some bills

322
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:01,932
before the
end of the month.

323
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:04,134
Uh, it's okay, man.
It's okay.

324
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:06,437
Bobby, you better not
be recording.

325
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:08,206
Uh, Bobby?
Yeah, I got
the whole thing.

326
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:09,173
Don't do this shit
in my house.

327
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:13,211
It's okay. Okay.
All right. I understand.

328
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:15,546
Okay.

329
00:15:15,548 --> 00:15:18,015
Why are you installing
all these
security cameras anyway?

330
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:19,049
Uh, we may have
a burglar.

331
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:20,183
Or a ghost.

332
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:21,418
A burglar.
Ghost.

333
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:25,389
Well, it just so happens
I have my own ghost hunter
reality show.

334
00:15:25,392 --> 00:15:26,291
Do you wanna know
what it's called?

335
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:28,158
I got one, too.

336
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:30,193
Wild guess,  <i>American Ghost?</i>

337
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:31,663
Wrong!
<i>Ghost Guys.</i>

338
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:34,599
It is trademarked,
so don't get
any funny ideas.

339
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,600
I definitely won't.
All right. See ya.

340
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,937
Yeah!
You know they're
shooting porn in there.

341
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,437
Really?
No way he owns it.

342
00:15:43,274 --> 00:15:45,610
Malcolm, what is that?

343
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,678
Well, I paid those
camera guys all this money

344
00:15:47,681 --> 00:15:51,081
and they left a big-ass
blind spot inside the hallway.

345
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:55,086
So you decided to
break my fan and rig up
this ridiculous camera?

346
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:56,520
Yep.

347
00:15:57,288 --> 00:15:59,123
Call me "Nigyver."

348
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,258
Wow.

349
00:16:03,227 --> 00:16:05,263
Cool.
All right, baby.
Come on.

350
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:07,465
All right.
All right.

351
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,433
- I'm so hungry.
- Me, too. Starving.

352
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:11,302
Okay, Rosa.
We're leaving.

353
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,403
<i>Buenas tardes, senores.</i>
<i>Okay.</i>

354
00:16:27,418 --> 00:16:29,320
It's crazy, right?

355
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:33,524
These stupid motherfuckers
don't think I speak English!

356
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:35,726
Hmm.

357
00:16:35,729 --> 00:16:38,196
Yo, I got a nice pool.
You want to come on down?

358
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:39,730
Yeah, we got a Jacuzzi.

359
00:16:48,673 --> 00:16:50,741
<i>Que pasa?</i>

360
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,513
<i>Ay, Dios mio!</i>

361
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,057
Whoo!  <i>¡Dios mio!</i>

362
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:08,593
Whoo!

363
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:12,730
Hey, Rosa. We're back.

364
00:17:13,531 --> 00:17:15,098
<i>Hola!</i>

365
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:21,071
Ah!

366
00:17:21,074 --> 00:17:22,740
<i>Si!</i>
<i>Yo tambien.</i>

367
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:24,375
I don't know
what you saying.

368
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,742
Mm-hmm!

369
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,414
- Baby!
- What?

370
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,215
Look at how
she's swimming.

371
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:33,785
Hey, Steve.
Steve, look.
Check this out.

372
00:17:33,787 --> 00:17:35,420
Black girl don't like
getting her hair wet.

373
00:17:35,422 --> 00:17:38,322
Hey, hey, hey!
Malcolm, cut that shit out!

374
00:17:38,324 --> 00:17:40,090
Just got my hair did.
You know that.

375
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:43,227
You're looking
good over there, baby.

376
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:44,595
Hey, show us your tits.
What?

377
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:46,396
Show us your tits!

378
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,365
Whoa, whoa.
No, no, no, no, no!

379
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:49,767
I knew she would do it.

380
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:52,804
You like that?

381
00:17:52,806 --> 00:17:54,337
No, no. That was awkward.

382
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:55,605
Oh, yeah? But did you
like it a little bit?

383
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:57,141
They're cockeyed.

384
00:17:57,143 --> 00:17:59,410
Yeah, I know.
One's bigger
than the other one.

385
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:00,545
That way you can
have a favorite.

386
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:02,346
Baby?

387
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:05,650
- No!
- Whoo!

388
00:18:05,652 --> 00:18:07,484
Your head's
gonna get pregnant!

389
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,618
Let's do reverse.

390
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:17,095
Wow, man, I am loving
this camera of yours.

391
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,195
This is really cool.

392
00:18:18,198 --> 00:18:22,232
I bet you're shooting
all kinds of extracurricular
activities with this camera.

393
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:23,334
Actually, I'm not.

394
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:24,434
You aren't?

395
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,670
None.
You're not?

396
00:18:25,672 --> 00:18:27,672
You know, ever since
Kisha moved in,

397
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:29,673
I haven't seen
no parts of the vagina.

398
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:31,608
No!
It's like she moved in,

399
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,277
and her vagina
moved out the same day.

400
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:34,578
You gotta be kidding me!
Yeah.

401
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,279
That makes me angry.

402
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,515
Not as angry as
it makes my penis.

403
00:18:37,517 --> 00:18:39,750
Well, I am angry
for your penis.

404
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:41,384
Mr. Happy is
not so happy.

405
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:42,653
Oh, that's infuriating.

406
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:43,887
Yeah, man.
Yeah, man.

407
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:45,722
It makes me very upset
to hear that.

408
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:46,857
But you know,
there is something
you can do

409
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:48,226
to spice it up
if you want to.

410
00:18:48,228 --> 00:18:48,893
Really?
Oh, yeah.

411
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:50,260
What?

412
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:51,895
Well, you know how, like,

413
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:53,698
if you get tired
of driving your car,

414
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,199
you might
test-drive a new car?

415
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:56,500
Mm-hmm.

416
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:57,902
Maybe you would
even let somebody else

417
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:00,605
drive your car
for a little while,
you know?

418
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:04,474
Get a whole new
appreciation of your vehicle
when you do that.

419
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:07,144
Are you talking about
swapping girlfriends?

420
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,446
- What? No!
-  Excuse me?

421
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:11,182
Oh, wow!

422
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:13,250
I don't know where you
were goin' with that!
Oh, wow!

423
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:14,218
I was talking about cars!

424
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,353
My bad.

425
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:17,521
You would never do it?

426
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:19,490
I would absolutely
never do it.

427
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,291
Me neither.
Me neither.

428
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:24,327
What kind of pervert
does that?

429
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,496
That's what you
would have to be.

430
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:27,164
It takes a pervert
to swap girlfriends.

431
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,232
You never have done it,
and you never would, huh?

432
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:30,567
No, Steve.

433
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:33,336
Even if you got drunk enough
or something like that?

434
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,239
Like, you might have a few
too many drinks and say,

435
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,440
"Why not?
Let's give it a try,"

436
00:19:36,442 --> 00:19:38,843
if there was a couple
that was into it.

437
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:40,243
No.
No. Yeah, me neither.

438
00:19:40,246 --> 00:19:41,546
That's how I feel.

439
00:19:41,548 --> 00:19:43,948
But even, like, maybe
if you got a little high,

440
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,615
maybe on a Saturday night
or something like that,

441
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:47,218
and you were like...

442
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,385
Even then.

443
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:50,788
Yeah. Like, even if
this couple was, like,

444
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:52,856
up for anything
and raring to go,

445
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:56,961
and she was hot to trot,
like, a hot, hot lady.

446
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:59,262
It wouldn't matter.
You wouldn't do it, right?

447
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:01,632
Nigger, no.

448
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:04,501
Same here.
We're in agreement.

449
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:07,270
It's crazy to swap
girlfriends like that.

450
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:09,941
I am with you 100%.

451
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:12,742
Steve, want a beer?

452
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:16,713
Hey, babe, did you
tell Steve we have a ghost?

453
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:17,815
We don't have a ghost.
A ghost?

454
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:19,650
Yeah.
Awesome.

455
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:21,719
We don't have a ghost.

456
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:22,953
No, Jenny, it's not cool.

457
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:24,321
We don't have a ghost.

458
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:26,457
You thought it
was cool in college.

459
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:27,959
We did a seance
and everything!

460
00:20:27,961 --> 00:20:29,926
A seance?
Oh, yeah. That's right.

461
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:30,994
You did a seance?

462
00:20:30,997 --> 00:20:32,596
Yes.
Honey, it's college.

463
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:33,763
You do a lot of silly stuff.

464
00:20:33,766 --> 00:20:34,898
Yeah.

465
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:36,968
Like that time we
got drunk and made out.

466
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:39,336
Oh, it's all hazy.

467
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:40,637
You know, college,
it's like a big fog.

468
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,905
We're gonna talk
about these college days.

469
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,374
Yeah, yeah.

470
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,609
A hazy, sexy fog,
it sounds like.

471
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:48,011
Wouldn't it be great if
we all spent the night?
Together?

472
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:49,346
Well, that's an
interesting idea.

473
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:50,647
What do you think
of that, Malcolm?

474
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,450
- A naked sleepover?
- No.

475
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:53,784
No?
It's weird.

476
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:55,019
Yeah, but it's definitely
gonna be weird.

477
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,587
But are you saying
weird good or weird bad?

478
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:58,823
Weird bad, Steve.

479
00:20:58,825 --> 00:21:00,625
Okay.

480
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:02,460
All right, you guys.
It's been real.

481
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:04,996
Listen,
I know a great psychic
if you need one.

482
00:21:04,998 --> 00:21:06,497
Okay.

483
00:21:06,499 --> 00:21:07,798
He told me
I'd be surrounded

484
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:11,269
by big, black spirits
in my near future.

485
00:21:12,336 --> 00:21:13,738
Vaginas crossed.

486
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,839
Yeah, okay.
Right? Goodbye!

487
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:18,442
Well.

488
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,310
Listen, before we go,
I just wanna talk to
you about something,

489
00:21:20,313 --> 00:21:21,612
'cause Jenny's got
a birthday coming up.

490
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:24,682
I wanna do something real
special for her, you know.

491
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:26,717
I was thinking maybe you could
invite a couple of guys over,

492
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:28,586
like your cousin Ray-Ray,
maybe?

493
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:31,355
that he hangs out with,
you know?

494
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:33,758
Jamal, and Hakim,
and Anforny, you know?

495
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:36,826
Just the six of us, right?
We'll have some fun.

496
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:38,996
We'll double stuff
the Oreo a little bit, huh?

497
00:21:38,998 --> 00:21:40,498
Dirty up the white snow?

498
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,432
Black poles, white holes.

499
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:44,969
You know, maybe all pile on
the little white rabbit,
right, you know?

500
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:47,305
Are you talking
about a mandingo party?

501
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:48,972
What? A what?

502
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,675
Excuse me!

503
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:54,045
I mean, I'm really,
uh, not into that.
But if you're into that...

504
00:21:54,047 --> 00:21:55,680
Um, I'm...

505
00:21:55,682 --> 00:21:57,347
Well, we might be able
to work something out

506
00:21:57,349 --> 00:22:00,084
Hey, buddy, I mean...
Okay, bye, Steve.

507
00:22:00,086 --> 00:22:01,384
Oh!

508
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:02,987
Oh, wow.

509
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:04,087
That's beautiful.
Okay, Jenny.

510
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:06,691
Okay, honey, come on.
Come on, honey, come in.

511
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:08,526
You're lucky.

512
00:22:08,528 --> 00:22:09,926
She is luckier.

513
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:12,329
Bye, guys. Bye!
All right.

514
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:15,633
Okay. All right.

515
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:17,701
I think
Jenny and Steve
are swingers.

516
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:19,470
You think? Wow.

517
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:20,938
This looks like
a ghetto Rite Aid.

518
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,440
Wrong Aid.

519
00:22:22,442 --> 00:22:24,775
Oh, shit!
Did somebody shave a yeti?

520
00:22:24,777 --> 00:22:26,711
Very funny.
I shaved my legs.

521
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:28,445
With what,
a weed whacker?

522
00:22:28,448 --> 00:22:30,748
Wow. That's like
Apollo Creed's chest hairs.

523
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,583
That is crazy.

524
00:22:32,585 --> 00:22:34,719
Oh! Hey!
Malcolm, come on!

525
00:22:34,721 --> 00:22:37,387
Dude, turn that off.
Get out of here.

526
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:38,756
You got to close this.
Stop it!

527
00:22:38,758 --> 00:22:40,590
I'm claustrophobic, okay?

528
00:22:40,593 --> 00:22:42,026
Yeah? Well,
I'm ass-trophobic.

529
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:43,794
You know what, Malcolm?
What?

530
00:22:43,796 --> 00:22:46,497
Love it or leave it, okay?
Here. Here.

531
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:48,098
Take it, okay?

532
00:22:48,101 --> 00:22:49,567
It's oak-y.

533
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:51,769
It's... It's full-bodied.

534
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:53,636
I believe it's open.

535
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:54,805
Oh, that's...
That's nasty!

536
00:22:54,807 --> 00:22:56,574
Mmm. The aroma.

537
00:22:56,576 --> 00:22:57,540
The nastiest thing ever.

538
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:58,776
No, Malcolm! Malcolm!

539
00:22:58,778 --> 00:23:00,510
Hey! No!

540
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:02,145
Move your
little nasty foot.
Stop it!

541
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:03,881
Ow! Ow! Malcolm!

542
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:22,532
Uh, Malcolm. Malcolm?
Hmm?

543
00:23:22,535 --> 00:23:24,034
The camera isn't off.

544
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:26,002
Yeah, the camera's off.
What are you talkin' about?

545
00:23:26,005 --> 00:23:27,404
The light is on.

546
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,605
That's the standby light.

547
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:30,540
That's the record light.

548
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:32,777
I don't want to be
like those stupid girls.

549
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:34,979
Kim Kardashian
with a sex tape.

550
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,948
First of all,
Kim Kardashian's
worth $150 million.

551
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:40,151
Think about it, Kisha.
You could have
your own reality show.

552
00:23:40,153 --> 00:23:42,920
You could have your
own clothing line,
your own perfume.

553
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:45,588
"Stank," by Kisha.

554
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,023
No.

555
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:49,125
Your window of opportunity
is closing quickly.

556
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:50,795
Turn it off.

557
00:23:50,797 --> 00:23:51,796
Oh, God,
you are a hater.

558
00:23:51,798 --> 00:23:53,029
I'm not.

559
00:23:58,036 --> 00:24:01,105
Malcolm. You ain't slick.
That camera's still on.

560
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,507
- What?
-  "What?"

561
00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:05,142
That's cheap.

562
00:24:07,747 --> 00:24:10,681
Whoo! Whoo!

563
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:12,750
Don't touch it.

564
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:14,184
Don't touch it.
That was crazy.

565
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:15,586
Oh, I got a cramp.

566
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:18,087
I told you we should
have recorded that.

567
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:20,089
I don't think they
make 30-second tapes.

568
00:24:20,092 --> 00:24:24,127
Oh, come on. That was
at least two minutes,
15, 16 seconds.

569
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,895
Whoo! That was great.

570
00:24:25,897 --> 00:24:27,730
Malcolm, you know
we have to go again, right?

571
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:30,901
I need a halftime.
You gotta talk to the coach.

572
00:24:30,903 --> 00:24:32,068
Get some new plays.

573
00:24:35,539 --> 00:24:37,575
Wake up.
Okay, okay.

574
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:38,675
Come on now.

575
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:39,876
Okay, okay.

576
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:41,578
Woody's sore.
Mmm.

577
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:45,648
Yeah.

578
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,853
Good morning, honey.

579
00:24:48,855 --> 00:24:50,688
Hi, baby.
Mwah.

580
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,224
Malcolm, I told you
to turn the camera off!

581
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:57,694
I know. I'm shit.

582
00:24:57,697 --> 00:25:00,096
But, baby, I was
tearin' it up last night.

583
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:01,632
Oh, please.
You were all right.

584
00:25:01,634 --> 00:25:02,932
Baby, check this move.
Look at that.

585
00:25:02,934 --> 00:25:04,535
Malcolm, I need you
to erase this tape.

586
00:25:04,537 --> 00:25:06,237
I don't wanna end
up on the Internet.

587
00:25:06,239 --> 00:25:07,570
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

588
00:25:07,573 --> 00:25:08,939
Rewind the video.

589
00:25:08,941 --> 00:25:10,773
Okay.

590
00:25:10,776 --> 00:25:12,276
Did you see that?
Uh-huh.

591
00:25:12,278 --> 00:25:13,743
See, I call that move
the Tornado.

592
00:25:13,746 --> 00:25:15,078
No, stupid!

593
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,548
Look! The door, it moved.
You see?

594
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,550
Oh, wow.

595
00:25:20,553 --> 00:25:23,253
Well, there is a rational
explanation for all that.

596
00:25:23,256 --> 00:25:25,556
See, what happens is,
with the Tornado, right,

597
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:28,125
the vortex in
which I move my hips,

598
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:29,759
especially with
a downward motion,

599
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:31,795
it creates that vortex.

600
00:25:31,797 --> 00:25:32,962
I'm surprised
the windows didn't
blow open.

601
00:25:32,964 --> 00:25:35,132
You are stupid.
Sometimes it does that.

602
00:25:35,134 --> 00:25:38,067
See, I'm working on a whole
natural disaster theme
for me and you.

603
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:40,170
We gonna start with
the Mudslide tonight.

604
00:25:40,172 --> 00:25:42,605
Or the Earthquake.
Earthquake is crazy!

605
00:25:42,607 --> 00:25:45,742
'Cause I just get in
and I shake up in there,
fast as I can. I just shake.

606
00:25:57,123 --> 00:25:58,788
Malcolm!

607
00:25:58,790 --> 00:25:59,890
Malcolm, come here,
please!

608
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:01,558
Quick!
What happened?
What happened?

609
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:05,162
Okay, so the glass was
on the counter,
and then it...

610
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:07,631
Something knocked it off!

611
00:26:07,633 --> 00:26:09,098
How do you explain that?

612
00:26:09,101 --> 00:26:10,601
Well, maybe you put it
on the edge of the counter,

613
00:26:10,603 --> 00:26:12,303
and it just slipped off.

614
00:26:12,305 --> 00:26:15,271
Last night,
it was the door, Malcolm.

615
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:18,709
And then, this morning,
the pot was on the floor.

616
00:26:18,711 --> 00:26:20,877
Maybe it wasn't put
on the rack properly.

617
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,713
All right,
I'll take credit for that.
Lord knows you don't cook.

618
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:25,249
Oh, I love you, but stop.
Be careful.

619
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,616
You're gonna get
glass in your foot

620
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:27,951
and be trackin' blood
all through the house

621
00:26:27,953 --> 00:26:29,053
like Bruce Willis
in  <i>Die Hard.</i>

622
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:35,792
Do you believe
me now, Malcolm? Hmm?

623
00:26:35,795 --> 00:26:39,262
Maybe it was your vortex.

624
00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:40,631
Oh, God.

625
00:26:53,744 --> 00:26:55,112
Did you hear that?

626
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:56,980
Nope.
What?

627
00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:01,018
What about that?

628
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:03,153
That was just
the house settling.

629
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:04,721
No big thing.
Just go back to sleep.

630
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:06,356
Go back to sleep?

631
00:27:09,729 --> 00:27:11,729
The wind?
What?

632
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:14,198
Negro, the windows
are closed!

633
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,666
Oh, hell, no! I'm out!

634
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:17,901
What? Malcolm!

635
00:27:19,672 --> 00:27:20,804
Malcolm!

636
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:32,249
Really?

637
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:34,183
Oh, hell, no.

638
00:27:34,185 --> 00:27:37,020
Malcolm, what are
you doing?

639
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:39,923
Bitch, there is a ghost
in the house. I'm out.

640
00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:41,090
You can't leave.

641
00:27:41,093 --> 00:27:42,192
You watch me.

642
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:44,862
Deuces.

643
00:27:47,097 --> 00:27:48,164
Malcolm!

644
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:54,137
You all right?
Who am I kidding?

645
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,840
I can't sell a house
in this market.

646
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,277
"Immediate possession."

647
00:28:01,681 --> 00:28:02,779
It's already possessed!

648
00:28:08,118 --> 00:28:10,887
Hi, Chip.
I'm Kisha.
Hi.

649
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:12,189
Hi, I'm Chip the Psychic.

650
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:13,289
Come on in.

651
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:15,159
Nice. Nice.

652
00:28:17,228 --> 00:28:18,996
Oh!

653
00:28:18,998 --> 00:28:23,333
And you...
You must be Malcolm.

654
00:28:23,335 --> 00:28:24,968
Mmm, yeah.
That's pretty good.
How did you know?

655
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:26,069
Uh, psychic.

656
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:27,371
See?

657
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:30,240
I have a lot of powers
all over my body.

658
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:32,942
Do you... You play basketball,
probably, a little bit, right?

659
00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:34,377
No, not really.
You don't?

660
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,145
No.
Well, you got
the body for it.

661
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:38,449
You're lucky.

662
00:28:38,451 --> 00:28:40,250
You're a lucky, lucky lady.

663
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:42,486
I'm gonna ask you
some questions.

664
00:28:42,488 --> 00:28:45,923
You know, nothing cray.
Just real simple stuff.

665
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:47,290
Okay, how long
have you guys
been together?

666
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:48,424
Two years.
Yes.

667
00:28:48,426 --> 00:28:50,227
Okay, Malcolm,
are you happy?
Yes.

668
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:51,795
Do you like
living with her?
Yes.

669
00:28:51,797 --> 00:28:53,329
Have you been
with a man?
No.

670
00:28:53,332 --> 00:28:55,065
Did you have
a good Halloween?
Yes.

671
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:56,333
Did you have
a good Christmas?
Yes.

672
00:28:56,335 --> 00:28:57,901
Do you like movies?
Yeah.

673
00:28:57,903 --> 00:28:59,001
Have you
been with a man?

674
00:28:59,003 --> 00:29:00,269
Yeah...
No. What? No!

675
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:02,005
Did you have
a good Easter?
Yes.

676
00:29:02,007 --> 00:29:03,272
Do you like booze?
Yes.

677
00:29:03,275 --> 00:29:04,974
Do you eat food
every day?
Yes.

678
00:29:04,977 --> 00:29:05,843
Have you
been with a man?

679
00:29:05,845 --> 00:29:06,977
Yes. No, no!

680
00:29:06,979 --> 00:29:08,878
I've never been with a man.

681
00:29:08,881 --> 00:29:10,780
Okay, I'm just asking
'cause I'm just trying
to get to know you.

682
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:13,116
I've never been with a man.
I've never been with a man.

683
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:14,984
I've never been
with a man.
Would you stop being so...

684
00:29:14,987 --> 00:29:15,853
I've never been
with a man!

685
00:29:15,855 --> 00:29:17,121
Okay!

686
00:29:17,123 --> 00:29:18,387
You don't have to
be loud and angry.

687
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:21,125
He keeps asking me if
I've been with a man!

688
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:22,226
I've never
been with a man!

689
00:29:22,228 --> 00:29:23,826
Okay.

690
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:25,095
I'm trying to get to know you.
Have you been with a man?

691
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:26,363
I sleep on this
side of the bed.

692
00:29:26,365 --> 00:29:27,431
Right.

693
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,333
She sleeps there.
Ick.

694
00:29:29,335 --> 00:29:32,201
And, you know, we keep
the camera right there.

695
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:35,439
And one night,
we saw the door
kind of just, like...

696
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:38,909
Oh, wow. So there was
some paranormal over there.

697
00:29:38,911 --> 00:29:40,544
No, she thinks
it's paranormal,

698
00:29:40,546 --> 00:29:42,913
and I think it's
'cause of the Tornado.

699
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:44,413
'Cause I created a vortex.

700
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:46,316
What does that mean?

701
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:48,018
We was havin' sex,
and I was hittin' it.

702
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:50,319
I was like...

703
00:29:50,322 --> 00:29:52,855
I was doing this round,
and I think the...

704
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:55,025
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey.

705
00:29:55,027 --> 00:29:56,826
Hey, you okay?
Yeah, sorry.

706
00:29:56,828 --> 00:29:58,095
You all right?

707
00:29:58,096 --> 00:29:59,195
I got light-headed
there for a second.

708
00:29:59,198 --> 00:30:00,897
Okay. All right.
Yeah, no, I'm good.

709
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,366
Check out the door.
You know what?

710
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:04,835
There is some dark
energy over here.

711
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:05,903
Really?

712
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:08,070
Yeah. Wow, that's crazy.

713
00:30:08,073 --> 00:30:10,240
- I didn't even...
- Oh!

714
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:11,375
We got a ghost.

715
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:12,509
Oh, my God,
it's got me!

716
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:15,211
It's got me!
It's got me!

717
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:17,181
It's got me!
Help! Help!

718
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:19,249
Hey, man!
Get off of me!

719
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:22,219
Oh, man!
Get off of me.

720
00:30:22,221 --> 00:30:24,253
What are you doing?

721
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:26,323
I don't know
what just happened.

722
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:28,090
That was so scary.

723
00:30:28,093 --> 00:30:30,527
Okay, you guys.
This is a simple
channeling exercise.

724
00:30:30,528 --> 00:30:31,994
Okay.

725
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:34,330
This is creepy.
Shh.

726
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:37,233
All right, Kisha,
now just breathe.
Relax.

727
00:30:37,236 --> 00:30:39,869
Do you feel anything?

728
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:41,238
No, not really.

729
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,307
What about you, Malcolm?

730
00:30:44,608 --> 00:30:46,242
Just your dick in my back.

731
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:49,479
Well, that's a start.

732
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:53,951
Now, there are two kinds
of paranormal entities.

733
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:57,119
I specialize in
the good ones.

734
00:30:57,122 --> 00:30:59,489
Okay, yeah, like
Casper the Friendly Ghost.

735
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:02,058
Oh!
Yeah, he's fun.

736
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,294
And also Patrick Swayze
from  <i>Ghost.</i>

737
00:31:04,296 --> 00:31:06,329
I love that movie.

738
00:31:06,332 --> 00:31:08,498
Yes, that one was
really moving.

739
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,234
Especially with the clay,
and he'd work
the clay and just...

740
00:31:11,237 --> 00:31:13,403
And he just
fuckin' has it, and...

741
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:17,641
Demons, though, are bad.

742
00:31:17,643 --> 00:31:20,443
Those are pure,
pure, pure evil.

743
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:23,547
And they will pop up
at the worst possible times.

744
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,414
You know, like herpes.

745
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,319
What?

746
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:31,989
What are you
looking at me for?

747
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:37,160
All I'm saying is,
do not aggravate a demon.

748
00:31:37,162 --> 00:31:38,461
Do not try to
contact them,

749
00:31:38,463 --> 00:31:42,266
and whatever you do,
do not film them.

750
00:31:42,268 --> 00:31:43,432
That will only
make things worse.

751
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:45,669
See? Don't film demons.

752
00:31:45,671 --> 00:31:47,336
Very bad.
Okay.

753
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:50,606
Well, thanks a lot
for coming out, man.

754
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:51,942
Is there anything
you wanna get off
your chest?

755
00:31:52,443 --> 00:31:55,578
Is there anything
you want to
put on my chest?

756
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,047
Huh?
Wait'll you see
the clay scene.

757
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:58,214
Wait, wait. Uh...

758
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:01,317
I have a confession
to make.

759
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:03,119
Yep, herpes!
I knew it.

760
00:32:03,122 --> 00:32:05,622
Oh! Ick!
No, I don't!

761
00:32:05,624 --> 00:32:08,692
But did I mention that I made
a deal with the devil

762
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:10,961
for a pair of
really cool Louboutins?

763
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:13,596
You made a deal
with the devil
for a pair of shoes?

764
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:17,034
Not shoes, Malcolm!
Louboutins, okay?

765
00:32:17,036 --> 00:32:20,002
They've got red soles,
and they make my calves pop!

766
00:32:22,207 --> 00:32:24,508
Well, I really
needed them, okay?

767
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:29,011
You are screwed, sista,

768
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:34,183
This demon is not
leaving this house
until it gets what it wants.

769
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:36,019
What's that?

770
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,386
Kisha.

771
00:32:39,022 --> 00:32:40,457
You're fine, Malcolm.

772
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:43,259
Like, you're free to
be whoever you want.

773
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:44,161
It's a five-man
wrestling league.

774
00:32:44,163 --> 00:32:45,228
I'm good.

775
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,329
It's so fun.

776
00:32:46,332 --> 00:32:47,463
I bet it is.
It's not for me.

777
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:49,098
And everyone's
really good.
Really?

778
00:32:49,101 --> 00:32:50,232
Yeah, no,
but it's competitive.

779
00:32:50,234 --> 00:32:53,036
It's something that...

780
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:55,404
Oh, my God.
I'm getting mind powers.

781
00:32:55,406 --> 00:32:57,507
Okay. All right.
I'm getting mind powers.

782
00:32:57,509 --> 00:33:03,113
Malcolm,  something
is going to happen to you

783
00:33:03,115 --> 00:33:05,414
that is going to change you.

784
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:07,616
Don't fight it.

785
00:33:07,618 --> 00:33:09,118
Whatever it is,
don't fight it, okay?

786
00:33:09,121 --> 00:33:11,188
Okay, I won't.
I won't.
I can save you.

787
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:12,622
It's five guys.
We wrestle on Monday.

788
00:33:12,624 --> 00:33:14,124
Okay.

789
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:15,759
I can save you.
No, thank you.

790
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,361
Save you!

791
00:33:17,363 --> 00:33:18,461
God.

792
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:20,063
I think that went well.

793
00:33:20,065 --> 00:33:21,731
We need to talk.

794
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:23,133
A demon, Kisha?

795
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:25,535
I'm sorry, Malcolm.

796
00:33:25,537 --> 00:33:28,137
Why...
Why didn't you tell me this,
like, on the first date?

797
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:30,106
Because you never would have
gone out with me again.

798
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:32,442
Exactly!

799
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:34,744
How long has this
been happening to you?

800
00:33:34,747 --> 00:33:36,512
Since I was a little kid.

801
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:38,448
What the shit is this?

802
00:33:39,483 --> 00:33:40,650
And you say I
tape everything.

803
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:43,119
Mm. Mm-mm-mm.

804
00:33:50,728 --> 00:33:54,631
<i>Happy birthday, Kisha.</i>
<i>Mama loves you.</i>

805
00:33:54,633 --> 00:33:56,665
<i>Ooh! To think you</i>
<i>almost didn't make it.</i>

806
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:58,769
<i>But good thing</i>
<i>that clinic was closed.</i>

807
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:01,538
<i>Ooh! God is good</i>
<i>all the time.</i>

808
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:04,508
<i>You are eight years ol.</i>
<i>Enjoy your birthday.</i>

809
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:07,443
<i>Sooner or later, you're gonna</i>
<i>come home from school one da.</i>

810
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:08,811
<i>"Where's stepdaddy?</i>
<i>Where's stepdaddy?"</i>

811
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:11,782
<i>And I'm gonna be gone.</i>

812
00:34:11,784 --> 00:34:14,751
<i>Happy birthday, Kisha.</i>
<i>Make a wish.</i>

813
00:34:14,753 --> 00:34:16,186
<i>Sit right there.</i>
<i>All right.</i>

814
00:34:16,188 --> 00:34:19,822
<i>I wish Tony can</i>
<i>stay with me forev.</i>

815
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:21,291
<i>Who is Tony?</i>

816
00:34:21,293 --> 00:34:23,059
<i>Who is Tony, baby?</i>
<i>He's my friend.</i>

817
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,427
<i>If you have friends,</i>
<i>they'd all be</i>

818
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,329
<i>gathered around here</i>
<i>drinking beer,</i>

819
00:34:26,331 --> 00:34:27,797
<i>smoking cigarettes,</i>
<i>having a good time,</i>

820
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,498
<i>gambling,</i>
<i>playing cards</i>
<i>and stuff.</i>

821
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:34,237
<i>You gonna blow it out?</i>
<i>Or you just gonna</i>
<i>look at us crazy?</i>

822
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,704
<i>Dang.</i>
<i>She ain't all there.</i>

823
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:39,175
<i>Lookin' all crazy.</i>
<i>You crazy.</i>

824
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:42,211
<i>Look, look,</i>
<i>look, look, look.</i>
<i>She got a lazy eye.</i>

825
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:49,652
<i>Blow out</i>
<i>the candles, baby.</i>

826
00:34:49,655 --> 00:34:51,655
<i>Tony, no!</i>

827
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:55,826
<i>You wanna throw cake</i>
<i>on my brand-new Betama?</i>

828
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:58,427
<i>You must be crazy!</i>

829
00:34:58,429 --> 00:34:59,829
<i>Ow! It wasn't me.</i>
<i>It was Tony.</i>

830
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:02,532
<i>I'm-a beat the Ty</i>
<i>out of you then.</i>

831
00:35:02,534 --> 00:35:04,467
<i>Ah, ah, ah.</i>
<i>Lamar, not so hard.</i>

832
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:08,472
<i>I won't beat my</i>
<i>own kids like th.</i>

833
00:35:08,474 --> 00:35:09,739
<i>I know that's right.</i>

834
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:19,248
Anything else
you wanna tell me?

835
00:35:19,251 --> 00:35:20,750
Well,

836
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:21,818
about the herpes.

837
00:35:23,186 --> 00:35:25,121
Baby, what are you doing?
Huh?

838
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,824
Oh, nothing. I'm just...
Just cleaning, that's all.

839
00:35:27,826 --> 00:35:29,759
You ever get that
not-so-fresh feeling?

840
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,730
Seriously, we're gonna
have to talk about your lies.

841
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:35,565
Oh, that's fizzing.
It's fizzing.

842
00:35:35,567 --> 00:35:37,400
It's herpes, Kisha.

843
00:35:37,402 --> 00:35:39,603
This ain't
a cold sore, Kisha.
This is the real thing.

844
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:43,572
Ah! You did this to me.

845
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:45,708
Get a match!
Get the goddamn match!

846
00:35:47,378 --> 00:35:50,347
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

847
00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:51,648
That hurt. Whoa!

848
00:36:50,307 --> 00:36:51,775
What the hell?

849
00:36:51,777 --> 00:36:52,876
What happened?

850
00:36:54,311 --> 00:36:56,346
Did...

851
00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:58,315
What'd you slap me for?

852
00:36:58,317 --> 00:36:59,682
Was I snoring?

853
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:01,251
Kisha!

854
00:37:01,751 --> 00:37:02,786
Kisha!

855
00:37:04,521 --> 00:37:05,655
The hell?

856
00:37:06,489 --> 00:37:07,724
Kisha.

857
00:37:08,458 --> 00:37:09,626
Kisha.

858
00:37:09,628 --> 00:37:10,994
What the hell?

859
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:13,362
Kisha.

860
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:14,898
Oh, shit!
Kisha, what the...

861
00:37:17,867 --> 00:37:19,402
Kisha, what are you doing?

862
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:23,539
What? Oh, that is gross.

863
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:25,842
Wait! No, baby,
that milk is
three weeks old.

864
00:37:25,844 --> 00:37:30,447
Oh! Baby.
Baby, what are you doing?

865
00:37:32,882 --> 00:37:36,820
I'll run to the store.
We're out of milk.

866
00:37:36,822 --> 00:37:38,521
I'll be right back.
No, no, you... No, no.

867
00:37:38,523 --> 00:37:39,856
Give me that.

868
00:37:42,327 --> 00:37:43,893
Honey, honey.

869
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:45,929
Where do you
keep the Pepto?
Oh, man.

870
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:47,931
Where do you
keep the Pepto?
My stomach hurts.

871
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:50,666
What are you doing?

872
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:52,001
I'm looking at
the tape from last night.

873
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:55,271
<i>Honey, you make me feel good.</i>

874
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:58,275
<i>Okay. Maybe some sleep</i>
<i>will make you feel good.</i>

875
00:37:58,277 --> 00:38:00,043
Oh, my God.

876
00:38:00,045 --> 00:38:03,045
I don't remember
doing any of this.
What am I doing?

877
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:05,748
Acting like a freak.
This is crazy.

878
00:38:05,751 --> 00:38:07,851
Wait, look at this.
Check this out.

879
00:38:07,853 --> 00:38:10,353
<i>Something weird...</i>
<i>Weird-weird-weird</i>
<i>is going on.</i>

880
00:38:12,391 --> 00:38:15,625
<i>Something weird</i>
<i>is going on.</i>

881
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:17,427
<i>Meow.</i>
<i>Honey, you make me</i>
<i>feel good.</i>

882
00:38:18,764 --> 00:38:22,331
<i>Weird is going on.</i>
<i>Weird-weird-weird</i>
<i>is going on.</i>

883
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:23,699
<i>Whoo!</i>

884
00:38:23,702 --> 00:38:25,534
<i>Weird-weird-weird-weird</i>
<i>is going on.</i>

885
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:28,003
<i>I'm a scary ghost!</i>

886
00:38:32,744 --> 00:38:34,411
<i>I can't breathe.</i>

887
00:38:34,413 --> 00:38:36,346
Baby, you mad?

888
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:37,012
Baby.

889
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:40,750
Malcolm!

890
00:38:41,786 --> 00:38:43,585
It's not a joke!

891
00:38:43,588 --> 00:38:46,956
Come on. I'm just trying
to make light
of a bad situation.

892
00:38:46,958 --> 00:38:48,925
Bad situation?
So, what,
now you're referring

893
00:38:48,927 --> 00:38:50,960
to my moving in
as a bad situation?

894
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:53,663
I didn't have
a demon in my house
till you moved in.

895
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:56,398
What happened to,
"You're living with me now.
I'll protect you"?

896
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,934
From a burglar,
not a ghost!

897
00:38:58,936 --> 00:39:00,336
You know what?
I ain't listening to this.

898
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,438
Where do you
think you're going?

899
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,373
Out.

900
00:39:04,376 --> 00:39:08,043
Oh, okay!
So you're just gonna
leave me here alone?

901
00:39:08,045 --> 00:39:08,945
Malcolm!

902
00:39:49,588 --> 00:39:50,853
Malcolm!

903
00:39:50,856 --> 00:39:52,521
Okay, I'm coming,
I'm coming, I'm coming!

904
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:53,422
What, what, what, what?

905
00:39:53,425 --> 00:39:54,490
Look at this!

906
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:56,925
Oh, wow. What the...

907
00:39:57,862 --> 00:39:59,596
Oh, Daddy!

908
00:40:01,865 --> 00:40:02,998
Malcolm!

909
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:05,702
Oh, shit.

910
00:40:05,704 --> 00:40:08,704
What kind of monster
would do this?

911
00:40:08,706 --> 00:40:10,539
Uh, uh, baby,
you were right.

912
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:12,675
Listen, there is
an evil spirit
in this house.

913
00:40:12,677 --> 00:40:14,510
I believe you.
I was so dumb.

914
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:18,414
Oh, shit. I feel it.
Oh, my God.
It's right there.

915
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,016
You feel that?
Feel it, feel it, feel it.

916
00:40:20,018 --> 00:40:21,918
- It's cold, right?
- Oh, my God!

917
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,554
Baby, we have to
get rid of this menace
once and for all.

918
00:40:24,556 --> 00:40:25,954
Ooh! The tape!
We can watch the tape.

919
00:40:25,956 --> 00:40:27,891
Wait, no! No, no, no.
Don't watch the tape.

920
00:40:27,893 --> 00:40:29,525
Don't watch the tape.
What?

921
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:31,827
Because it's just me
and you against him.

922
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:35,697
You evil spirit!
You leave this house alone!

923
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:37,434
Now!

924
00:40:37,436 --> 00:40:39,202
You hear me?
You get out!

925
00:40:39,204 --> 00:40:40,903
Get out, demon.
Get out!

926
00:40:40,905 --> 00:40:42,972
Get out, get out, get out!

927
00:40:42,974 --> 00:40:44,507
See, I believe you.
No.

928
00:40:44,509 --> 00:40:45,974
I need you to shut up
once and for all.

929
00:40:45,976 --> 00:40:47,943
Let's watch the tape.
I am shutting up! God!

930
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:57,152
Mm-hmm.

931
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:00,456
<i>Hi, Daddy.</i>

932
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:04,793
<i>You want to come in here</i>
<i>and move in on my house? H?</i>

933
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:07,697
<i>You like</i>
<i>haunting people, huh?</i>
<i>I ain't scared of you.</i>

934
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:08,831
Uh, baby? Um...

935
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:10,132
<i>Fuck you, and fuck your daddy!</i>

936
00:41:10,135 --> 00:41:11,201
This is disturbing.
You don't want to see it.

937
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:12,902
I will break your arm.

938
00:41:12,903 --> 00:41:14,670
<i>You wanna watch TV?</i>

939
00:41:16,172 --> 00:41:17,606
Wow!

940
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:19,708
Oh. Oh, my.

941
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:24,746
See, that hurt. Lookee.

942
00:41:24,748 --> 00:41:25,782
I got a boo-boo,
baby, right...
I don't care.

943
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:37,059
On my father's ashes!
Really?

944
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:39,929
<i>You think you the shit?</i>
<i>I'll show you the shit.</i>

945
00:41:39,931 --> 00:41:42,130
Nasty! That is so nasty.

946
00:41:42,132 --> 00:41:43,199
I will...

947
00:41:43,201 --> 00:41:47,103
So, what did you do,
wipe your ass
with the curtains?

948
00:41:51,976 --> 00:41:53,610
Baby, you didn't like
the curtains anyway.

949
00:41:53,612 --> 00:41:54,978
You're an animal.
We'll get new curtains.

950
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,679
It's just curtains.

951
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:59,114
I'd be an animal
if I didn't wipe at all.
Baby!

952
00:41:59,117 --> 00:42:00,849
This isn't gonna
prove any...
Yes, it is!

953
00:42:01,952 --> 00:42:04,786
I swear that I
will listen to Kisha

954
00:42:04,789 --> 00:42:07,824
whenever she says
strange things are going on
in the house.

955
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:09,259
And?

956
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,561
And...

957
00:42:11,563 --> 00:42:15,797
And I swear that I won't
antagonize the ghost anymore.

958
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,967
Even though I didn't
bring him in the house.

959
00:42:18,235 --> 00:42:20,269
And?

960
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:23,072
And I swear that
Kisha is the prettiest

961
00:42:23,074 --> 00:42:25,307
and the sexiest
girl for never.

962
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:28,043
And?

963
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:29,945
And I promise I won't shit
in your daddy's ashes.

964
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:31,047
Louder!

965
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:32,181
I promise I won't shit

966
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:35,018
on Kisha's daddy's ashes
ever again.

967
00:42:35,686 --> 00:42:37,320
Happy?
Yes.

968
00:42:37,322 --> 00:42:38,855
Can I have my
video game back now?
No!

969
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:41,190
See, man?

970
00:42:43,626 --> 00:42:45,327
Why are you putting
powder on the floor?

971
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:48,297
See, the powder
is gonna let me see
his footprints.

972
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,766
And you think
this is gonna work.

973
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:52,168
It did on  <i>Scooby-Doo.</i>

974
00:43:02,681 --> 00:43:04,246
Malcolm, did you
hear that?

975
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:05,748
Mm-hmm.

976
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:08,684
Then why are you
pretending to be asleep?

977
00:43:08,686 --> 00:43:09,851
'Cause I know if I'm up,

978
00:43:09,853 --> 00:43:13,322
where them
scary-ass noises
are coming from.

979
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:15,157
Get your black ass up.

980
00:43:15,826 --> 00:43:17,193
See, man?

981
00:43:22,632 --> 00:43:25,168
Kisha.

982
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:26,768
Camera.
Get the camera.
Get the camera.

983
00:43:30,039 --> 00:43:32,909
Whose plan was
stupid now, Kisha? Hmm?

984
00:43:32,911 --> 00:43:35,043
Pass me a bat.
A bat?

985
00:43:35,045 --> 00:43:36,211
You're gonna use
a bat on a ghost?

986
00:43:36,213 --> 00:43:38,748
I'm sorry. I left my
proton pack in the car.

987
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:39,916
Pass me the bat.

988
00:43:39,918 --> 00:43:41,985
This ghost's got
some ugly-ass feet.

989
00:43:41,987 --> 00:43:43,085
Looks more like an alien.

990
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:47,090
I don't wanna do it.
I don't wanna do it.

991
00:43:47,092 --> 00:43:48,858
I can't do it.
I can't do it.
What?

992
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:49,992
Malcolm!
No, this... No.

993
00:43:49,994 --> 00:43:51,360
This ain't what we do.

994
00:43:51,362 --> 00:43:53,128
This is for white people.
Will you grow some balls!

995
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:55,864
This is for white people.
This ain't what niggers do.

996
00:43:55,867 --> 00:43:58,635
We don't investigate.
We run. We run, we live.

997
00:43:58,637 --> 00:44:00,335
If we was in a movie theater,
some black woman be screaming,

998
00:44:00,338 --> 00:44:02,338
"Don't do it!
Don't do it, boy!

999
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:04,407
"He behind there.
He in there."

1000
00:44:04,409 --> 00:44:06,909
If we know he's in there,
why the fuck are
we going in there?

1001
00:44:06,911 --> 00:44:08,010
Come on, baby.

1002
00:44:08,012 --> 00:44:09,945
I don't want to do it.

1003
00:44:09,947 --> 00:44:12,114
Stop it.
What if it bites me?

1004
00:44:12,117 --> 00:44:14,050
It's not a zombie.
It's a ghost.

1005
00:44:14,052 --> 00:44:16,085
You wanna play?
That's right!

1006
00:44:16,086 --> 00:44:17,954
You hurt my mother.
You killed my mother.

1007
00:44:17,956 --> 00:44:19,288
That's right!

1008
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:21,289
That's not helping.
It's not helping none.

1009
00:44:21,291 --> 00:44:23,226
You got this. Go.

1010
00:44:24,896 --> 00:44:26,262
You want some of this?
This is how we...

1011
00:44:26,264 --> 00:44:27,429
Get him!

1012
00:44:27,431 --> 00:44:29,164
Bust your...
Whoop that ghost's ass!

1013
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:32,300
Turn on the lights!
Oh, my God! Rosa?

1014
00:44:32,302 --> 00:44:33,869
Rosa? Rosa! Rosa!

1015
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:35,672
<i>Si, senor! Que pasa?</i>

1016
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,974
Oh, my... I'm so sorry.
I thought you...

1017
00:44:37,976 --> 00:44:40,809
I... I didn't know.
I thought you was a ghost.

1018
00:44:40,811 --> 00:44:43,679
- Ghost?
- Or an alien.

1019
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:46,949
I was talking
about your feet, not your
citizenship or lack thereof.

1020
00:44:46,951 --> 00:44:48,083
I quit.

1021
00:44:48,085 --> 00:44:49,786
See? Give me the camera!

1022
00:44:49,788 --> 00:44:50,887
Go fix this.

1023
00:44:50,889 --> 00:44:52,088
No! I'm not fixing nothing!

1024
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:55,224
Oh, can't believe
Rosa quit.

1025
00:44:55,226 --> 00:44:59,829
Yeah, well, you know,
this is stressful
on all of us.

1026
00:44:59,831 --> 00:45:02,197
I think I might have
a little something
to help alleviate

1027
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:03,900
some of that stress.

1028
00:45:04,969 --> 00:45:07,103
Take it. You hit it.
Yeah?

1029
00:45:07,105 --> 00:45:09,806
Now you gonna go spit
up the end and shit.

1030
00:45:09,807 --> 00:45:11,074
Hold it, hold it.

1031
00:45:14,744 --> 00:45:17,380
Damn!

1032
00:45:17,382 --> 00:45:20,048
Yay! Bravo.
Encore, encore.

1033
00:45:20,818 --> 00:45:23,052
I see a face in the chip.

1034
00:45:23,054 --> 00:45:24,887
It's got a mustache.

1035
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:26,188
You're not moving...
Never get high.

1036
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:28,123
...fast enough, Malcolm.
Never get high

1037
00:45:28,126 --> 00:45:29,992
with people that don't
know how to get high.

1038
00:45:29,994 --> 00:45:31,193
I'm baked.

1039
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:59,454
Oh, shit.

1040
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,161
<i>Los Angeles County, 911.</i>

1041
00:46:17,074 --> 00:46:19,108
My dick!

1042
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:22,844
He fell for it!

1043
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:25,347
No, I don't want to.

1044
00:46:26,516 --> 00:46:29,217
Okay. Okay, I'll do it.

1045
00:46:34,525 --> 00:46:39,362
Yeah! That's a shotgun
for your ass.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

1046
00:46:43,101 --> 00:46:44,400
Is he gone?
Oh, he's gone.

1047
00:46:44,402 --> 00:46:45,534
Wow!

1048
00:46:45,536 --> 00:46:47,335
That's that Criss Angel
shit right there.

1049
00:46:47,338 --> 00:46:49,438
Yo, that ghost good.
That ghost good.

1050
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,007
That ghost good.
That ghost good.

1051
00:46:56,112 --> 00:46:57,346
Oh, my God.
What?

1052
00:46:57,347 --> 00:46:58,947
That was awesome!

1053
00:47:06,456 --> 00:47:09,025
Disgusting!

1054
00:47:09,027 --> 00:47:11,193
Malcolm, wake up.
Mmm?

1055
00:47:11,894 --> 00:47:13,429
You peed the bed.

1056
00:47:15,097 --> 00:47:16,199
What?

1057
00:47:16,201 --> 00:47:17,599
You peed the bed.

1058
00:47:17,601 --> 00:47:19,501
Oh, shit! Oh!

1059
00:47:21,038 --> 00:47:22,471
Oh, that's...

1060
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:25,907
That's not funny.

1061
00:47:25,909 --> 00:47:27,275
Oh, that's fucked up.

1062
00:47:28,045 --> 00:47:29,445
That's real fucked up.

1063
00:47:32,081 --> 00:47:34,317
Hey, Steve,
thanks a lot for bringing
the Ouija board over, man.

1064
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:35,384
I really appreciate that.
Oh, no worries, bro.

1065
00:47:35,385 --> 00:47:36,485
- Hopefully...
- Hey, baby.

1066
00:47:36,487 --> 00:47:41,324
Oh, hey, Kisha,
the dinner was
so amazing.

1067
00:47:41,326 --> 00:47:45,460
The chicken was
unbelievably tender
and real juicy.

1068
00:47:45,463 --> 00:47:47,963
Oh, well, actually,
that was all Malcolm.

1069
00:47:47,965 --> 00:47:50,333
Was it now?
I'll be damned.

1070
00:47:50,335 --> 00:47:54,302
Well, thanks for
letting me nibble on the leg
because I love dark meat.

1071
00:47:54,304 --> 00:47:56,606
Mmm. Well, that is true.
She eats it up.

1072
00:47:56,608 --> 00:47:58,474
- I bet she does.
- She eats it all up.

1073
00:47:58,476 --> 00:48:00,141
Yeah.

1074
00:48:00,143 --> 00:48:01,443
You guys are
gonna love this wine.

1075
00:48:01,445 --> 00:48:03,211
It is a very robust red.

1076
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:04,313
Yum.

1077
00:48:04,315 --> 00:48:06,449
Well, you know
what they say.

1078
00:48:06,451 --> 00:48:08,617
"The blacker the berry,
the sweeter the juice."

1079
00:48:08,619 --> 00:48:10,119
Mm-hmm.

1080
00:48:10,121 --> 00:48:12,954
Okay, y'all need to
cut this out.

1081
00:48:12,956 --> 00:48:14,489
Well, you know what?
Normally, we don't
have to chase this hard.

1082
00:48:14,492 --> 00:48:15,992
Mm-hmm.

1083
00:48:15,994 --> 00:48:17,393
Steve...
Hmm?

1084
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:19,961
I was talking about
that stupid board.

1085
00:48:19,963 --> 00:48:21,963
- Oh.
- Oh.

1086
00:48:21,965 --> 00:48:24,099
Baby, I just want to
communicate with it.

1087
00:48:25,936 --> 00:48:28,603
Are you a ghost
or a demon?

1088
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,074
Who's doing that?
Malcolm.
Who's doing that?

1089
00:48:33,077 --> 00:48:34,610
I don't know.
It's not me.
I swear to God.

1090
00:48:34,612 --> 00:48:37,280
"G."

1091
00:48:37,282 --> 00:48:38,481
You guys.

1092
00:48:38,483 --> 00:48:40,449
"O."

1093
00:48:40,451 --> 00:48:42,318
Steve, are you
pushing this?
I'm not doing anything.

1094
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,286
Oh, what? "S."

1095
00:48:44,289 --> 00:48:45,420
Go where...

1096
00:48:46,456 --> 00:48:47,590
"T."

1097
00:48:49,293 --> 00:48:51,661
A "gost?"
What the hell
is a "gost"?

1098
00:48:51,663 --> 00:48:54,163
Oh, maybe he's
trying to spell "ghost."

1099
00:48:54,164 --> 00:48:55,530
Are you trying
to spell "ghost"?

1100
00:48:57,233 --> 00:48:58,333
You're doing that?

1101
00:48:58,335 --> 00:48:59,501
No. I'm not
moving it, I swear.

1102
00:49:01,938 --> 00:49:02,704
"Yes."

1103
00:49:04,173 --> 00:49:06,641
Wait. So, he just
spelled "ghost" "gost."

1104
00:49:08,246 --> 00:49:11,681
What kind of illiterate,
bitch-ass ghost is this?

1105
00:49:11,682 --> 00:49:14,317
Please. Can you please
use "gost" in a sentence?

1106
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:16,152
Yeah, right.

1107
00:49:16,153 --> 00:49:17,686
Up yours,
you stupid "gost."

1108
00:49:19,257 --> 00:49:20,489
He probably dyslexic, too.

1109
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:23,025
He probably
spells "boo," O-O-B.

1110
00:49:23,027 --> 00:49:24,393
Ooh!

1111
00:49:24,394 --> 00:49:26,128
Oh.
Oh.

1112
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:28,496
Whoa, whoa!

1113
00:49:30,132 --> 00:49:31,701
Somebody's sensitive.

1114
00:49:31,702 --> 00:49:32,969
And stupid.

1115
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:38,373
You know what?
I think we'll probably just
show ourselves out.

1116
00:50:07,704 --> 00:50:09,170
Good morning, honey.

1117
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:10,206
Good morning.
Mmm.

1118
00:50:12,108 --> 00:50:13,208
Hey.

1119
00:50:13,409 --> 00:50:14,510
Mmm.

1120
00:50:14,512 --> 00:50:16,411
Well, all right.

1121
00:50:16,414 --> 00:50:23,152
Baby, that is
the best night's sleep
I've had since I moved in.

1122
00:50:23,153 --> 00:50:24,786
Well, maybe because you made
me sleep in the other room.

1123
00:50:26,222 --> 00:50:28,190
What are you
talking about?

1124
00:50:28,192 --> 00:50:30,059
We had
a breakthrough last night.

1125
00:50:30,594 --> 00:50:32,460
A breakthrough? Really?

1126
00:50:32,463 --> 00:50:34,295
Yes, Malcolm.

1127
00:50:34,297 --> 00:50:39,300
The way that you touched me,
caressed me, made love to me.

1128
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:43,304
What are you
talking about?

1129
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:45,775
Malcolm,
we had sex last night!

1130
00:50:45,777 --> 00:50:47,476
No, we didn't.

1131
00:50:47,478 --> 00:50:49,445
Yes, we did.
For about two hours!

1132
00:50:49,447 --> 00:50:51,579
Uh, that definitely
wasn't me.

1133
00:50:51,581 --> 00:50:53,481
Well, who else
could it have been?

1134
00:50:56,519 --> 00:50:57,519
No, get off of me!

1135
00:51:07,331 --> 00:51:09,498
Oh, my God.

1136
00:51:12,501 --> 00:51:16,137
<i>Mmm.</i>

1137
00:51:16,139 --> 00:51:17,373
<i>Mmm, Malcolm.</i>

1138
00:51:17,706 --> 00:51:19,507
What?

1139
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:20,809
<i>Ooh, that's new.</i>

1140
00:51:23,815 --> 00:51:27,615
Oh.
<i>Are you doing the alphabet?</i>

1141
00:51:27,617 --> 00:51:29,552
<i>Uh-uh, nigger,</i>
<i>clean your plate.</i>
<i>Come on.</i>

1142
00:51:30,655 --> 00:51:34,222
<i>Slob it down, slob it down.</i>

1143
00:51:34,224 --> 00:51:36,324
<i>Waterboarding your ass.</i>

1144
00:51:37,494 --> 00:51:38,760
<i>Mm, Malcolm.</i>
<i>Did you grow?</i>

1145
00:51:40,364 --> 00:51:42,797
<i>Ride the pony! Ride it. Oh!</i>

1146
00:51:44,469 --> 00:51:46,668
<i>Oh! Get it! Get it! Get it!</i>
<i>Oh, I've had it.</i>

1147
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:49,704
<i>Oh, yeah! Dip it!</i>
<i>Dip it down!</i>

1148
00:51:50,541 --> 00:51:53,208
Why don't I finish up...
I can't watch anymore.

1149
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:54,742
I just can't watch anymore.
I'll finish.

1150
00:52:02,487 --> 00:52:04,253
<i>Uh-uh, you ain't done yet.</i>

1151
00:52:13,764 --> 00:52:15,864
I had no idea
you was a squirter.

1152
00:52:17,867 --> 00:52:19,568
Neither did I?

1153
00:52:22,838 --> 00:52:24,840
Hey.
Don't touch me.

1154
00:52:24,842 --> 00:52:28,643
You seriously
have an attitude
with me right now?

1155
00:52:28,646 --> 00:52:31,246
You liked it.
What?

1156
00:52:31,248 --> 00:52:33,181
You heard me.
You liked it.

1157
00:52:33,184 --> 00:52:35,617
You like having
sex with that thing

1158
00:52:35,619 --> 00:52:36,885
more than you like
having sex with me.

1159
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:41,590
Malcolm, I was asleep.

1160
00:52:41,592 --> 00:52:42,657
Mm-hmm.
Talk to the hand.
I was...

1161
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:44,159
That's the hand.
Talk to it.

1162
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:45,427
I was asleep, okay?

1163
00:52:45,429 --> 00:52:46,896
I didn't know I was
having sex with a ghost.

1164
00:52:46,898 --> 00:52:48,597
Aha!

1165
00:52:48,599 --> 00:52:50,900
You just admitted
to having sex with a ghost!

1166
00:52:50,902 --> 00:52:54,335
And you liked it!
"Oh, Malcolm, you grew."

1167
00:52:54,905 --> 00:52:56,271
What happened, Kisha?

1168
00:52:56,273 --> 00:52:57,840
I'm not adequate
enough for you?

1169
00:52:57,842 --> 00:53:01,242
Huh? I'm sorry.
I tried Extense, Kisha.

1170
00:53:01,244 --> 00:53:02,478
Went through
the whole program.

1171
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:05,213
I did Cialis,
Viagra and Maca.

1172
00:53:05,215 --> 00:53:06,681
Okay.
All it did was
get me dizzy,

1173
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:08,483
you know...
Okay, stop it, all right?

1174
00:53:08,485 --> 00:53:10,452
That is not fair!
I was anally bleeding

1175
00:53:10,454 --> 00:53:11,954
for a month,
and you didn't even know.

1176
00:53:11,956 --> 00:53:13,956
Listen, that is not fair,

1177
00:53:13,958 --> 00:53:16,759
because I'm the one
who was violated,
not you.

1178
00:53:21,264 --> 00:53:22,697
I'm sorry.

1179
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:24,567
I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1180
00:53:26,469 --> 00:53:28,737
Must have been
a horrific experience
for you.

1181
00:53:28,739 --> 00:53:30,472
I'm sorry.

1182
00:53:30,474 --> 00:53:33,208
Eh, could have been worse.

1183
00:53:35,411 --> 00:53:36,512
Hey, cuz... Ray-Ray.

1184
00:53:36,514 --> 00:53:37,612
You got a beef
up in here?

1185
00:53:37,614 --> 00:53:39,748
Lots of niggers.
Not beef. Hey...

1186
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:41,817
Hey, what the fuck is
you taping for, Kisha?

1187
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:43,885
We thugs.
We can't be on no TV!

1188
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:45,820
Shut up, Ray-Ray.

1189
00:53:45,822 --> 00:53:47,822
Get the fuck off me.
Okay. Sorry.

1190
00:53:47,824 --> 00:53:49,324
So, what's going on
with this beef, homey?

1191
00:53:49,327 --> 00:53:51,460
It's that old bitch
next door,
ain't it, homey?

1192
00:53:51,461 --> 00:53:53,228
Yeah, she was
eyeballing me, cuz,

1193
00:53:53,231 --> 00:53:55,297
when I was all up
in her windowsill
last night.

1194
00:53:55,298 --> 00:53:57,766
But she got a nice body,
though, cuz.

1195
00:53:57,768 --> 00:53:59,735
You know, like a sexy-ass
baked potato, homey.

1196
00:53:59,737 --> 00:54:00,936
It's not like that.

1197
00:54:00,938 --> 00:54:02,637
What the fuck is it like,
then, homey?

1198
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:04,974
Well, someone's coming
between me and Kisha.

1199
00:54:04,976 --> 00:54:06,976
Somebody fucked
your girl, cuz?

1200
00:54:06,978 --> 00:54:08,610
Well, not...
I be the one that
fucked your girl!

1201
00:54:08,612 --> 00:54:10,378
Oh, please.

1202
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:12,280
How you let somebody
fuck your girl
before me, cuz?

1203
00:54:12,282 --> 00:54:13,514
We family, nigger!

1204
00:54:13,516 --> 00:54:14,717
I... I'm sorry... Kinda.

1205
00:54:14,719 --> 00:54:17,652
How the fuck do you "kinda"
bang Kisha, homey?

1206
00:54:17,655 --> 00:54:20,289
Did he have
one pant leg in,
one pant leg out?

1207
00:54:20,291 --> 00:54:22,324
Like,
he wasn't even interested
in fucking her, homey?

1208
00:54:22,326 --> 00:54:23,992
Like, he had somewhere
better to be, homey?

1209
00:54:23,994 --> 00:54:26,027
Okay, Ray-Ray,
that is not what it's like.

1210
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:29,297
And can you
please tell your Negro
to back the hell up off me?

1211
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:31,634
Hey! Pelvis back
2 inches, homey.

1212
00:54:31,635 --> 00:54:33,635
But stay up
on her, though.

1213
00:54:33,637 --> 00:54:35,436
What the fuck is
it like then, Kisha? Hmm?

1214
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:36,704
If you listen,
I'll tell you.

1215
00:54:36,706 --> 00:54:38,340
You tell me!

1216
00:54:38,342 --> 00:54:40,708
I can't wait to get
my hands on this fool.

1217
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:42,543
- Come on out, cuz!
Ray-Ray, cut it out.

1218
00:54:42,545 --> 00:54:44,313
You're gonna make it mad.

1219
00:54:47,483 --> 00:54:50,351
I don't give a fuck, Kisha!

1220
00:54:50,353 --> 00:54:53,289
He should be worried about
making Ray-Ray mad
up in here, bitch!

1221
00:54:53,291 --> 00:54:54,722
Who you
callin' a bitch?

1222
00:54:54,724 --> 00:54:55,858
Show yourself!

1223
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:57,025
No, Ray, don't do that!
Don't...

1224
00:55:01,331 --> 00:55:03,065
What the fuck is that?

1225
00:55:03,067 --> 00:55:04,800
A ghost, Ray.

1226
00:55:05,902 --> 00:55:07,902
A "ghost" ghost?
A "ghost" ghost.

1227
00:55:07,905 --> 00:55:10,905
Yes! Ray-Ray,
that's what
we've been trying

1228
00:55:10,907 --> 00:55:12,840
to tell you
for 15 minutes!

1229
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:15,010
You idiot.

1230
00:55:15,012 --> 00:55:19,715
What the...
What in the hell...

1231
00:55:21,016 --> 00:55:22,918
What happened to
your furniture, cuz?

1232
00:55:31,594 --> 00:55:33,094
Get your hands up, cuz!

1233
00:55:33,097 --> 00:55:34,429
You're trying to
get me killed, cuz.

1234
00:55:34,431 --> 00:55:35,831
I didn't, Ray-Ray! Ray!

1235
00:55:36,865 --> 00:55:38,000
God!

1236
00:55:40,737 --> 00:55:41,836
My stuff!

1237
00:55:43,539 --> 00:55:46,041
Babe, you got to admit,
it's kind of impressive.

1238
00:55:52,581 --> 00:55:55,050
Perfume? Hey!

1239
00:55:55,052 --> 00:55:57,552
Yeah, it's new.
It's called Entity.

1240
00:55:57,554 --> 00:56:00,054
I like it.

1241
00:56:00,056 --> 00:56:02,123
What's the occasion?
What's up?

1242
00:56:02,126 --> 00:56:05,094
Malcolm, is it a crime
to want to sleep

1243
00:56:05,096 --> 00:56:06,728
with no panties on?

1244
00:56:09,632 --> 00:56:12,568
I get it. This...
This ain't for me.

1245
00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:13,936
This is for him.

1246
00:56:13,938 --> 00:56:15,838
Who are you
talking about?

1247
00:56:16,773 --> 00:56:18,606
You know exactly
who I'm talking about.

1248
00:56:18,608 --> 00:56:21,409
For your little
supernatural lover.

1249
00:56:21,411 --> 00:56:22,777
Malcolm,
you're being ridiculous,

1250
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:24,579
and I'm gonna
say this right now.

1251
00:56:24,581 --> 00:56:26,481
Insecurity is
not attractive.

1252
00:56:26,483 --> 00:56:28,650
Yeah? Well,
being a paranormal
jump-off

1253
00:56:28,652 --> 00:56:31,753
is not attractive
either, hon.
Good night.

1254
00:56:31,755 --> 00:56:33,655
You're taking this
too far.
Whatever.

1255
00:56:33,657 --> 00:56:35,623
I have no interest
in a ghost.

1256
00:56:46,503 --> 00:56:48,536
You gonna try
and contact him?

1257
00:56:49,838 --> 00:56:51,072
Good night!
I was gonna...

1258
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:52,007
Good night!

1259
00:57:58,208 --> 00:57:59,875
<i>Get off of me!</i>

1260
00:58:03,512 --> 00:58:05,179
Baby.
Hey!

1261
00:58:05,181 --> 00:58:06,581
Hey.
Hey.

1262
00:58:06,583 --> 00:58:07,949
What's...
What's up with the donut?

1263
00:58:07,952 --> 00:58:11,887
Oh, uh, I just got a little
hemorrhoid, that's all.

1264
00:58:11,889 --> 00:58:13,521
Oh, I'm sorry.
Hurts.

1265
00:58:13,523 --> 00:58:16,057
So, anything happen
eventful last night?

1266
00:58:16,059 --> 00:58:19,260
No, nothing eventful.
Just, you know, the usual.

1267
00:58:19,262 --> 00:58:22,097
Just, like, you know,
door slams, stuff like that.

1268
00:58:22,099 --> 00:58:23,532
Oh. I wanna see.

1269
00:58:23,534 --> 00:58:24,733
Nope, nope.

1270
00:58:24,735 --> 00:58:25,666
Nothing for you
to see, baby.

1271
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:27,101
Wait! Baby!

1272
00:58:27,103 --> 00:58:28,637
Hey!

1273
00:58:28,639 --> 00:58:29,871
Can you... So rude!
Stop! Stop!

1274
00:58:29,873 --> 00:58:31,072
Hey! Malcolm!
Would you...

1275
00:58:31,074 --> 00:58:32,807
Cut it...
Just gotta do...

1276
00:58:32,809 --> 00:58:34,076
Oh, my!
You know what?

1277
00:58:34,077 --> 00:58:35,911
You...
You got altar-boyed.

1278
00:58:35,913 --> 00:58:37,246
You know what?

1279
00:58:37,248 --> 00:58:39,547
You can't...
Malcolm, hold on a second.

1280
00:58:39,550 --> 00:58:41,583
No, no, no, no, no!
You just uploaded it!

1281
00:58:41,585 --> 00:58:42,684
No, no, no!

1282
00:58:42,686 --> 00:58:44,018
Oh, no!

1283
00:58:44,922 --> 00:58:48,757
You're gonna be bigger than
<i>Charlie Bit My Finger.</i>

1284
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:55,931
Say hello
to the camera.

1285
00:58:55,932 --> 00:58:59,668
Get the camera out my face.
I'm not in the mood. Stop it!

1286
00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:05,039
Now that you've been
touched by an angel,
suddenly you're camera shy?

1287
00:59:06,108 --> 00:59:08,277
Let me ask you
a question, Kisha.

1288
00:59:08,278 --> 00:59:10,045
Is this the first
ghost you slept with?

1289
00:59:10,047 --> 00:59:12,748
Or it's the first one
I caught you with?

1290
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:14,248
You wanna go there?
Yeah, I wanna go there.

1291
00:59:14,251 --> 00:59:15,617
When did you
become ghost pussy?

1292
00:59:15,619 --> 00:59:20,556
Maybe I wouldn't need a ghost
if I was with a real man!

1293
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:24,860
There are Super Bowl ads
that last longer than you do!

1294
00:59:24,862 --> 00:59:28,230
People wait all year
for those
Super Bowl ads, baby.

1295
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:29,764
All year!

1296
00:59:29,766 --> 00:59:32,034
And maybe it's 'cause
every time I see you naked,

1297
00:59:32,036 --> 00:59:34,135
all I can think about is
you sitting on the toilet,

1298
00:59:34,137 --> 00:59:38,039
I'm sorry, Kisha.
Some things just
shouldn't be shared.

1299
00:59:38,041 --> 00:59:39,206
I let my guard down and...

1300
00:59:39,208 --> 00:59:40,742
Oh, you let
your guard down.

1301
00:59:40,744 --> 00:59:41,809
...you're gonna
throw it back in my face?

1302
00:59:41,811 --> 00:59:43,110
You killed my dog!

1303
00:59:43,112 --> 00:59:44,713
You have not let this go!

1304
00:59:44,715 --> 00:59:45,780
Yeah, let's go there.

1305
00:59:45,782 --> 00:59:46,882
I did not kill your dog!

1306
00:59:46,884 --> 00:59:48,349
You dog murderer.

1307
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:50,117
That was my baby,
and you killed it
on purpose!

1308
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:51,186
Oh, your baby was
87 years old!

1309
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:53,655
Shh.

1310
00:59:56,192 --> 00:59:57,858
Okay.
Okay.

1311
00:59:57,860 --> 00:59:59,027
All right, come on.
Let's go outside.

1312
00:59:59,028 --> 01:00:00,996
Okay. Okay.
Come on.

1313
01:00:00,998 --> 01:00:03,065
Okay. Go!
Okay.

1314
01:00:03,067 --> 01:00:05,766
Well, you heard the psychic,
all right?

1315
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:07,135
It feeds off of
negative energy.

1316
01:00:07,137 --> 01:00:08,769
All of your arguing
is making it stronger.

1317
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:09,771
My arguing?
My arguing?

1318
01:00:09,773 --> 01:00:10,905
You're the one that...

1319
01:00:10,907 --> 01:00:12,173
That's right.

1320
01:00:12,175 --> 01:00:13,307
We have to
stop fighting.
I can't.

1321
01:00:13,309 --> 01:00:14,742
You are getting
on my nerves.

1322
01:00:14,744 --> 01:00:16,677
Well, just pretend.

1323
01:00:25,922 --> 01:00:27,655
Good thing we
switched to plastic.

1324
01:00:37,099 --> 01:00:38,733
We'll have to get
that pot rack looked at.

1325
01:00:38,735 --> 01:00:40,235
Mm-hmm.

1326
01:00:51,215 --> 01:00:52,146
Tea's ready.
Mmm.

1327
01:01:02,724 --> 01:01:04,126
I'm gonna make
a run to Starbucks.

1328
01:01:13,101 --> 01:01:14,436
Can you pick me
up a latte?

1329
01:01:14,438 --> 01:01:15,737
You got it!

1330
01:01:31,855 --> 01:01:32,954
Malcolm!

1331
01:01:41,831 --> 01:01:44,032
Yeah! I kicked you
in your ghost balls!

1332
01:01:44,034 --> 01:01:45,467
I got some for you...

1333
01:01:49,905 --> 01:01:51,239
Malcolm!

1334
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:54,242
Wake up!
Nigger, open your eyes!

1335
01:01:54,244 --> 01:01:56,811
Take off those
damn headphones!

1336
01:01:56,813 --> 01:01:58,480
Malcolm!

1337
01:02:02,952 --> 01:02:04,418
Malcolm!

1338
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:06,387
Malcolm!

1339
01:02:19,434 --> 01:02:21,469
Yeah, listen.
Something's wrong
with Kisha.

1340
01:02:21,472 --> 01:02:23,472
No, no, she's been
cleaning all morning.

1341
01:02:24,974 --> 01:02:27,876
Dude, Kisha don't clean.

1342
01:02:27,878 --> 01:02:30,211
That's good, baby.
Not the couch, honey!
Not the couch.

1343
01:02:30,213 --> 01:02:32,146
Not the couch.
Yes, the floor.

1344
01:02:32,148 --> 01:02:34,782
Yeah, good girl, good girl.

1345
01:02:34,784 --> 01:02:37,184
Yo, man, earlier,
I caught her masturbating

1346
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,820
with a crucifix.

1347
01:02:39,822 --> 01:02:41,356
Kisha?

1348
01:02:43,059 --> 01:02:44,259
Wouldn't you rather
use this?

1349
01:02:49,465 --> 01:02:50,431
Okay.

1350
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:53,268
Exactly. I'm...

1351
01:02:55,471 --> 01:02:57,204
Uh, dude, I gotta go.

1352
01:02:57,206 --> 01:03:00,041
No, she's
walking the dog.

1353
01:03:00,043 --> 01:03:02,244
What's wrong with that?
The dog is dead.

1354
01:03:02,246 --> 01:03:04,780
I gotta go.
Uh, Kisha?

1355
01:03:05,882 --> 01:03:07,916
Kisha. Oh, boy. Kisha!

1356
01:03:09,050 --> 01:03:11,253
Kisha? Baby?

1357
01:03:13,222 --> 01:03:16,358
Listen,
I just wanted to apologize
for the way I been acting.

1358
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:20,327
and I don't want anything
to come between us.

1359
01:03:20,329 --> 01:03:23,398
And what the hell is that
<i>Twilight</i>shit on your neck?

1360
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:26,534
Oh, my God! Oh, God!

1361
01:03:26,536 --> 01:03:27,969
What the hell?

1362
01:03:29,304 --> 01:03:31,438
Oh, yeah.
She is definitely on the rag.

1363
01:03:33,275 --> 01:03:35,010
Oh, Father.
Thank God you could make it.

1364
01:03:35,945 --> 01:03:37,478
Nigger, call me "Doug."

1365
01:03:37,481 --> 01:03:39,547
I don't like being
called "Father." No way.

1366
01:03:39,550 --> 01:03:42,217
Plus, I got a couple issues
with a few people out there

1367
01:03:42,219 --> 01:03:44,385
claiming false child support.

1368
01:03:44,387 --> 01:03:46,521
I mean,
just 'cause the little
nigger got my eyes,

1369
01:03:46,523 --> 01:03:49,490
my nose, my extremely rare
AB-negative blood type,

1370
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:52,126
don't mean I'm
the damn daddy.

1371
01:03:52,128 --> 01:03:54,195
Plus, I'm still in training.

1372
01:03:54,197 --> 01:03:55,996
At the seminary?

1373
01:03:55,998 --> 01:03:57,364
No, the penitentiary.

1374
01:03:57,367 --> 01:03:59,166
What?
Shit, nigger,

1375
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:01,135
I've been
incarcerated 15 years.

1376
01:04:01,137 --> 01:04:03,471
Oh.
But you learn a lot out there
reading on the yard.

1377
01:04:03,472 --> 01:04:06,240
You shank a nigger,
come in,
read the scripture.

1378
01:04:06,242 --> 01:04:08,376
Shank a motherfucker,
read the scripture.

1379
01:04:08,378 --> 01:04:09,945
You gonna let
a nigger in or what?

1380
01:04:09,947 --> 01:04:13,280
Damn.
Standing out here, nigger.
It's cold as hell.

1381
01:04:16,318 --> 01:04:17,318
Ooh.

1382
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:21,155
Uh, bro, I'm gonna have
to level with you.

1383
01:04:21,157 --> 01:04:23,157
This bitch don't look right.

1384
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:27,094
I mean, she look all
ashy and shit, and just...

1385
01:04:27,097 --> 01:04:29,364
You know, like E.T.
with a weave.

1386
01:04:29,365 --> 01:04:31,065
If I was you,
I'd just be out.

1387
01:04:31,068 --> 01:04:32,534
Let's just go.
Come on. Let's go.

1388
01:04:32,536 --> 01:04:35,135
Uh, I...
I can't leave her.
That's my girl.

1389
01:04:35,137 --> 01:04:36,471
Are you kidding me?
Come on, man.

1390
01:04:36,472 --> 01:04:38,139
There's so much
pussy in the world, man.

1391
01:04:38,141 --> 01:04:39,608
You don't have to
be with just her.

1392
01:04:39,610 --> 01:04:41,009
Come to the congregation.

1393
01:04:41,010 --> 01:04:43,010
I've got a few in
the congregation,

1394
01:04:43,012 --> 01:04:44,478
I'm trying to tell you.
Check this out.

1395
01:04:48,184 --> 01:04:49,483
Now, I know she look old.

1396
01:04:49,485 --> 01:04:51,652
I know she...
But she a freak,
and she got skills.

1397
01:04:51,655 --> 01:04:53,554
Can we go in there
and just save her?

1398
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:55,990
Yo! Yo, dawg,
you yelling at me
right now?

1399
01:04:55,992 --> 01:04:58,293
I know you just
didn't scream on me, dawg.

1400
01:04:58,295 --> 01:05:00,661
I'm here to
exorcise your bitch, man.

1401
01:05:00,664 --> 01:05:02,963
So you wanna
go in the room.
All the way in?

1402
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:06,434
Look at her hair.
Her hair's all crazy.

1403
01:05:07,637 --> 01:05:09,170
You think I'm scared
right now, but I'm not.

1404
01:05:09,172 --> 01:05:10,304
I didn't think
you was scared.

1405
01:05:10,306 --> 01:05:12,007
No, I'm just
a little concerned

1406
01:05:12,009 --> 01:05:14,275
that I don't have
the right stuff.

1407
01:05:14,277 --> 01:05:16,177
Do you have,
like, a loaded gun?

1408
01:05:16,179 --> 01:05:17,478
I'll shank this bitch
for you.

1409
01:05:21,385 --> 01:05:24,184
It's cold as
a motherfucker in here, man.
Y'all ain't got no heat?

1410
01:05:26,021 --> 01:05:28,322
How you doing,
crazy bitch?

1411
01:05:28,324 --> 01:05:29,456
Kisha.

1412
01:05:29,458 --> 01:05:32,260
Kisha, I'm Father Doug.

1413
01:05:33,195 --> 01:05:36,063
I'm here to
un-possess you.

1414
01:05:36,065 --> 01:05:38,400
Wait a minute.
She's moving.

1415
01:05:38,402 --> 01:05:42,503
This is some
crazy-ass shit, man.

1416
01:05:42,505 --> 01:05:43,972
Who are you?

1417
01:05:45,541 --> 01:05:48,043
I wasn't
expecting her to talk.

1418
01:05:48,045 --> 01:05:49,311
I'm Father Doug.

1419
01:05:49,313 --> 01:05:51,478
Connect the cut.
Connect the cut.

1420
01:05:53,550 --> 01:05:56,251
Connect the cut.
Connect the cut.
Connect the cut.

1421
01:05:56,253 --> 01:05:59,119
Oh, oh, that's some of that
Busta Rhymes shit

1422
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:00,322
she doin' right there.

1423
01:06:00,324 --> 01:06:02,423
She's on that  <i>Bus A Bus.</i>

1424
01:06:02,425 --> 01:06:04,559
It's kinda more
like Twista, though.
It's real fast.

1425
01:06:09,431 --> 01:06:11,599
Do you know how to
connect the cuts?

1426
01:06:18,740 --> 01:06:21,076
Uh, uh, uh.

1427
01:06:21,077 --> 01:06:23,210
Tic-tac-toe in your face!

1428
01:06:23,213 --> 01:06:25,447
Straight X's,
straight across, diagonal.

1429
01:06:25,449 --> 01:06:27,581
I almost had your
ass the other way.

1430
01:06:27,583 --> 01:06:31,186
Tic-tac-toe on your arm,
connect the cuts.

1431
01:06:31,188 --> 01:06:32,519
That's what she was saying,
"Connect the cuts."

1432
01:06:33,389 --> 01:06:35,556
I wanna show you something.

1433
01:06:39,195 --> 01:06:43,764
"Suck it." That's gangsta!
That's gangsta.

1434
01:06:43,766 --> 01:06:45,367
You wanna see mine?

1435
01:06:45,369 --> 01:06:51,039
Check this out.
I did a little something
a while back.

1436
01:06:51,041 --> 01:06:53,775
I did that in prison.
Yeah, you know,

1437
01:06:53,777 --> 01:06:56,244
it hurt. But, you know,

1438
01:06:56,246 --> 01:06:58,278
you gotta go through it.
You gotta earn it.

1439
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:00,215
Everybody went crazy.
They was like,

1440
01:07:00,217 --> 01:07:02,150
"No, you didn't!
You so hard, dawg!"

1441
01:07:02,152 --> 01:07:03,717
I had control of
that TV for a month.

1442
01:07:05,355 --> 01:07:07,588
Would you like to
see my paintings?

1443
01:07:09,090 --> 01:07:10,724
Sure. Of course.

1444
01:07:10,726 --> 01:07:15,163
You know, I consider myself
a bit of an art aficionado.

1445
01:07:15,164 --> 01:07:17,231
I think it's going well.
It's going good.

1446
01:07:19,402 --> 01:07:21,135
Mm-hmm.

1447
01:07:21,137 --> 01:07:23,070
If, uh...

1448
01:07:23,072 --> 01:07:25,407
Well, you know, if I can be
perfectly honest with you,

1449
01:07:25,409 --> 01:07:26,608
it's your
technique that's sloppy.

1450
01:07:26,610 --> 01:07:28,175
But that's, you know,

1451
01:07:28,177 --> 01:07:30,411
to be expected from someone
that's possessed.

1452
01:07:37,652 --> 01:07:39,253
Hmm?

1453
01:07:42,690 --> 01:07:45,226
Ah!

1454
01:07:46,362 --> 01:07:47,762
Damn, that made
my breath stink.

1455
01:07:48,664 --> 01:07:51,331
Man, that breath is kickin'!

1456
01:07:51,333 --> 01:07:53,601
I can only imagine
what the kitty smell like.

1457
01:07:53,603 --> 01:07:55,603
Pure evil.

1458
01:07:55,605 --> 01:07:57,072
Goddamn.

1459
01:08:02,143 --> 01:08:04,545
I'm Dan "the Man" Kearney
and today on  <i>Ghost Guys</i>

1460
01:08:04,547 --> 01:08:07,081
we're investigating
paranormal activity

1461
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:09,349
at the Johnson residence
in suburban Los Angeles.

1462
01:08:09,351 --> 01:08:11,186
This is going be
very unsettling.

1463
01:08:11,188 --> 01:08:13,088
Not like those other
fake ghost hunter shows.

1464
01:08:13,090 --> 01:08:14,489
This stuff is real.

1465
01:08:14,490 --> 01:08:18,158
And I don't mean like,
"I saw my dead nana" scary,

1466
01:08:18,161 --> 01:08:21,662
but scary like,
"I left a bag of meth
in the glove box

1467
01:08:21,664 --> 01:08:23,331
"and I'm getting
pulled up by the cops

1468
01:08:23,332 --> 01:08:25,300
"and I got a hot pipe
under the seat."

1469
01:08:25,301 --> 01:08:27,668
That kind of scary.
Let's go inside.

1470
01:08:27,671 --> 01:08:31,206
All right,
on behalf of  <i>Ghost Guys,</i>

1471
01:08:31,207 --> 01:08:34,208
the greatest ghost-hunter
show on the Internet
or cable access,

1472
01:08:34,211 --> 01:08:36,578
I'd like to thank you
for having us.
You've made a good choice.

1473
01:08:36,579 --> 01:08:38,313
You're welcome.
Thank you very
much for coming.

1474
01:08:38,314 --> 01:08:40,180
Malcolm, Malcolm,
I'm not sure about this.

1475
01:08:40,182 --> 01:08:43,784
I mean, this guy, sure.
But Sling Blade there,
don't trust him.

1476
01:08:43,787 --> 01:08:45,619
You said you needed
ghost hunters right?

1477
01:08:45,622 --> 01:08:48,155
I also said I
needed a psychic.

1478
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:51,725
Chip, hey, what's up?

1479
01:08:51,728 --> 01:08:53,328
What's going on?
What are you doing here?

1480
01:08:53,329 --> 01:08:54,796
I'm a psychic,
I sensed you
needed my help.

1481
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:56,264
I do.

1482
01:08:56,265 --> 01:08:57,364
There's a new person.

1483
01:08:57,367 --> 01:09:00,301
Yeah, that's Bob.
Come on, let's go.

1484
01:09:00,302 --> 01:09:03,304
Hey, there's something
different about you.
Something new.

1485
01:09:03,305 --> 01:09:05,873
I can't quite put
my finger in you.
On you. On it.

1486
01:09:05,876 --> 01:09:07,141
Haircut.

1487
01:09:07,144 --> 01:09:08,309
Someone's got a secret.

1488
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:09,511
No, I don't. Come on.

1489
01:09:09,512 --> 01:09:11,179
Hey, guys.

1490
01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:15,315
Gentlemen,
what we have here
is a crazy bitch.

1491
01:09:15,318 --> 01:09:17,185
Now, I would leave
her possessed ass

1492
01:09:17,186 --> 01:09:19,386
in the alley downtown
if it was me,

1493
01:09:19,389 --> 01:09:22,256
but apparently,
Malcolm's got
a thing for the freak.

1494
01:09:22,259 --> 01:09:23,925
Holy shit.

1495
01:09:23,926 --> 01:09:26,161
So, what you're saying is,
there's an actual
demon here in the house?

1496
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:27,729
It's in the bitch.

1497
01:09:28,764 --> 01:09:31,533
I'm sorry, "ho."
No disrespect.

1498
01:09:31,534 --> 01:09:33,768
"Bitch" is fine.
"Bitch" is fine.

1499
01:09:33,770 --> 01:09:36,203
All right,
this is what I'm getting.

1500
01:09:36,206 --> 01:09:41,376
The entity does not want
to leave this house,

1501
01:09:42,177 --> 01:09:43,344
okay?

1502
01:09:44,445 --> 01:09:47,582
It's struggling
to stay inside.

1503
01:09:47,583 --> 01:09:49,884
And Malcolm,
I need to know.

1504
01:09:49,886 --> 01:09:53,453
How far are you gonna go
to get this demon out?

1505
01:09:53,456 --> 01:09:55,390
I'll do anything.

1506
01:09:56,760 --> 01:10:00,962
I don't see how
this is gonna help anything.

1507
01:10:00,963 --> 01:10:02,963
This just got weird.

1508
01:10:02,966 --> 01:10:04,765
What is this
supposed to do?

1509
01:10:06,935 --> 01:10:10,805
Um... Nothing.
I was just trying to see
how far you would go.

1510
01:10:12,274 --> 01:10:13,341
What did I tell you?

1511
01:10:13,342 --> 01:10:14,442
I think she looks fine.

1512
01:10:14,444 --> 01:10:15,710
Clearly does not
look fine.

1513
01:10:15,712 --> 01:10:17,612
She looks fucked up.
I'm gonna need my Bible.

1514
01:10:17,613 --> 01:10:19,247
You're gonna bless her?

1515
01:10:19,248 --> 01:10:22,216
Well, yeah,
I blessed this joint.
Mm-hmm.

1516
01:10:22,219 --> 01:10:24,685
Right out of
the First Chronicles.

1517
01:10:24,688 --> 01:10:28,957
I haven't done many exorcisms,
but I don't think
that's appropriate.

1518
01:10:28,958 --> 01:10:33,261
I get it, I get it.
I can fix that,
though, right now.

1519
01:10:33,262 --> 01:10:34,328
I got a little something.

1520
01:10:34,331 --> 01:10:35,829
What's going on?

1521
01:10:35,832 --> 01:10:38,865
That's a demon party.
Yeah, look out.

1522
01:10:42,537 --> 01:10:44,404
What is this, 1985?

1523
01:10:44,407 --> 01:10:47,641
'Cause I feel like
we could exorcise
any demons in the area.

1524
01:10:47,644 --> 01:10:49,978
What? I'll take on
a whole team of demons.

1525
01:10:49,979 --> 01:10:51,378
What we should do is
get all the demons
in one room

1526
01:10:51,381 --> 01:10:52,479
and get rid of them
all at once.

1527
01:10:52,481 --> 01:10:54,381
Do a collective
demon-gathering.

1528
01:10:54,384 --> 01:10:55,550
We just walk up
to people's doors,

1529
01:10:55,551 --> 01:10:56,717
"How you doing?
How you doing?"

1530
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:59,686
"We heard y'all got
demons up in there.
What's up?"

1531
01:10:59,689 --> 01:11:03,957
I used to braid hair.
I could actually
braid her hair right now.

1532
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:06,261
I'll be hitting her
with some Allen Iversons
and stuff.

1533
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:09,296
I'll give her
some Sprewells.
I'll take it back.

1534
01:11:09,298 --> 01:11:11,765
Let's do
a little exorcism.

1535
01:11:11,768 --> 01:11:14,435
All right,
"Blessed is he

1536
01:11:14,436 --> 01:11:17,771
"who, in the name of
charity and goodwill,

1537
01:11:19,408 --> 01:11:22,844
"shepherds the weak
through
the valley of darkness.

1538
01:11:22,845 --> 01:11:26,814
"For he is truly
his brother's keeper

1539
01:11:26,815 --> 01:11:29,951
"and the finder
of lost children.

1540
01:11:29,953 --> 01:11:33,621
"And you will know
my name is the Lord

1541
01:11:33,622 --> 01:11:37,324
"when I lay my
vengeance upon you!"

1542
01:11:37,327 --> 01:11:40,395
Did you just quote
Sam Jackson in  <i>Pulp Fiction?</i>

1543
01:11:42,032 --> 01:11:48,036
You got that.
You got me on that.
You got me on that one!

1544
01:11:48,037 --> 01:11:49,737
I love Sam Jackson, dawg.

1545
01:11:49,738 --> 01:11:51,506
The Jheri curl
will be dripping
and everything.

1546
01:11:51,507 --> 01:11:52,974
Plus, on the plane movie.

1547
01:11:52,975 --> 01:11:55,042
When he was on the plane
and he killed the snakes.

1548
01:11:55,045 --> 01:11:56,577
That's my favorite movie.

1549
01:11:56,578 --> 01:11:58,779
"Enough is enough!

1550
01:11:58,782 --> 01:12:01,849
"I have had it with these
motherfucking snakes

1551
01:12:01,850 --> 01:12:03,717
"on this
motherfucking plane!"

1552
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:05,653
Hey, all right!
That's what I'm
talking about.

1553
01:12:05,654 --> 01:12:07,055
Guys!
All right, all right!

1554
01:12:07,056 --> 01:12:10,658
Exorcism. That's what
we're here for, right?

1555
01:12:10,659 --> 01:12:13,694
Yes, go back to the thing
that got us here
in the first place.

1556
01:12:13,697 --> 01:12:15,395
Where we met.

1557
01:12:15,398 --> 01:12:17,631
My man!

1558
01:12:17,634 --> 01:12:22,502
By the powers
vested to me,

1559
01:12:22,505 --> 01:12:25,605
that somebody gave me
while I was locked up,

1560
01:12:25,608 --> 01:12:29,777
from
the correctional institution
in Lompoc, that's up north...

1561
01:12:29,779 --> 01:12:33,847
I want the demon that's
in you to come out
and holler at a brother.

1562
01:12:33,850 --> 01:12:36,684
Demon, come up
out of Kisha, demon.

1563
01:12:36,685 --> 01:12:38,418
Come out!
Just come out!

1564
01:12:38,421 --> 01:12:39,487
Come up out of Kisha!

1565
01:12:39,488 --> 01:12:40,421
Come up
out of there, demon.

1566
01:12:40,422 --> 01:12:43,056
Come out! Come out!

1567
01:12:43,059 --> 01:12:43,925
Come out!

1568
01:12:44,426 --> 01:12:45,693
Come out!

1569
01:12:45,694 --> 01:12:48,496
Hey! I'm not the one
with the demon, she is.

1570
01:12:49,530 --> 01:12:51,099
We all have demons, Malcolm.

1571
01:12:52,569 --> 01:12:54,702
I know what
you did last summer.

1572
01:12:54,703 --> 01:12:55,737
You better not do this.

1573
01:12:57,905 --> 01:12:58,939
Let her go, she's fat.

1574
01:13:00,876 --> 01:13:02,909
Kisha! Kisha!

1575
01:13:03,845 --> 01:13:06,146
Kisha! Oh, my God.

1576
01:13:09,818 --> 01:13:10,952
Kisha?

1577
01:13:13,055 --> 01:13:14,488
Kisha?

1578
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:19,025
Oh, hey, buddy,
you made it.

1579
01:13:19,028 --> 01:13:23,064
Grab a finger sandwich,
they're delish!

1580
01:13:23,065 --> 01:13:24,931
About time you
came up in here.

1581
01:13:24,934 --> 01:13:27,534
'Cause there ain't no party
like a mandingo party.

1582
01:13:27,537 --> 01:13:30,070
'Cause a mandingo
party don't stop.

1583
01:13:30,073 --> 01:13:32,640
Drink up, sweetheart.
You need some water?

1584
01:13:32,641 --> 01:13:35,042
Where are you going?
Hey, don't let her down.

1585
01:13:35,043 --> 01:13:36,144
It's her birthday.

1586
01:13:36,145 --> 01:13:37,412
Oh, God.

1587
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:38,845
Hey, did you find Kisha?

1588
01:13:38,847 --> 01:13:40,113
Uh, no,
she's not in there.

1589
01:13:40,115 --> 01:13:41,181
You sure?
What's going on in there?

1590
01:13:41,184 --> 01:13:42,449
Uh, nothing at all.

1591
01:13:42,452 --> 01:13:43,684
Is that a mandingo party?
No.

1592
01:13:43,685 --> 01:13:45,619
Man, I wanna get
my Kunta Kinte on.

1593
01:13:47,122 --> 01:13:48,422
Kisha?

1594
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:51,525
Kisha?

1595
01:13:54,462 --> 01:13:55,128
Oh, shit!

1596
01:13:55,131 --> 01:13:56,497
Baby?

1597
01:13:57,966 --> 01:13:59,934
Oh, my God!
What did you do?

1598
01:13:59,935 --> 01:14:01,601
Shit, I did you a favor.

1599
01:14:02,872 --> 01:14:05,573
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, Rosa!

1600
01:14:05,574 --> 01:14:07,809
I just wanted my
last check, Malcolm.

1601
01:14:07,810 --> 01:14:09,710
Oh, my God,
you shot my housekeeper.

1602
01:14:09,712 --> 01:14:11,445
You mean,
your ex-housekeeper.

1603
01:14:11,448 --> 01:14:13,713
Look, man, the bitch can't be
jumping out on me like that.

1604
01:14:13,716 --> 01:14:15,649
You ain't gonna
tell nobody, right?
I got warrants.

1605
01:14:15,652 --> 01:14:16,884
Hurry, she's in here.

1606
01:14:16,886 --> 01:14:18,618
Come on, guys.

1607
01:14:18,621 --> 01:14:19,854
Kisha!

1608
01:14:19,855 --> 01:14:21,956
We got her cornered.
Baby.

1609
01:14:21,957 --> 01:14:24,024
Father, do something.
Oh, my God!

1610
01:14:26,561 --> 01:14:28,462
Man, that demon
is a freak.

1611
01:14:28,465 --> 01:14:30,564
Yeah, the crazy ones
always got the best pussy.

1612
01:14:30,567 --> 01:14:32,733
The moon landing was fake.

1613
01:14:32,734 --> 01:14:33,967
What?

1614
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:36,570
Biggie and Tupac

1615
01:14:36,573 --> 01:14:38,939
are alive.

1616
01:14:38,942 --> 01:14:42,143
Paul Ryan will be
the next president.

1617
01:14:42,145 --> 01:14:44,110
The demon lies.

1618
01:14:44,113 --> 01:14:45,645
Well, except for
the thing about Tupac.

1619
01:14:45,648 --> 01:14:46,780
He is alive.
He's got a new
album coming out.

1620
01:14:46,783 --> 01:14:48,181
What the fuck
is going on here?

1621
01:14:48,184 --> 01:14:50,251
There's an exorcism
happening, people!

1622
01:14:53,087 --> 01:14:55,222
The power of
Christ compels you.

1623
01:14:55,225 --> 01:14:57,625
The power of
Christ compels you.

1624
01:14:57,627 --> 01:15:02,829
No, it's a new cologne
from Khloe and Lamar.
It's unisex.

1625
01:15:02,832 --> 01:15:04,631
I can smell Lamar.

1626
01:15:04,634 --> 01:15:05,932
Get her!

1627
01:15:07,269 --> 01:15:09,069
Baby!

1628
01:15:10,573 --> 01:15:12,739
Oh! She knows some of
that Spider-Man shit!

1629
01:15:15,144 --> 01:15:16,676
Oh, my God!

1630
01:15:16,679 --> 01:15:18,078
It's got me!

1631
01:15:18,081 --> 01:15:19,913
Chip!
I'm afraid of the dark.

1632
01:15:19,916 --> 01:15:21,948
Why do have your
hand on my balls?

1633
01:15:21,951 --> 01:15:24,150
I'm protecting
them from spirits.

1634
01:15:24,153 --> 01:15:25,552
Get off of me!

1635
01:15:25,555 --> 01:15:27,154
There she is!

1636
01:15:27,155 --> 01:15:28,588
She's going to the basement.

1637
01:15:28,591 --> 01:15:32,225
Bobby? Oh, my God!
Bobby, my brother's gone!

1638
01:15:32,228 --> 01:15:33,793
Oh, my God! Let's go!

1639
01:15:33,796 --> 01:15:34,962
- Bobby?
- Bobby?

1640
01:15:34,963 --> 01:15:36,564
Bobby?

1641
01:15:36,565 --> 01:15:38,231
This is dark.
I don't wanna
go down here.

1642
01:15:38,234 --> 01:15:41,135
Kisha!
Look at all these
weird markings.

1643
01:15:41,136 --> 01:15:42,802
Kisha was here.
She has a sign.

1644
01:15:42,805 --> 01:15:44,171
Bobby!

1645
01:15:45,940 --> 01:15:48,109
Oh, my God! She got Bobby!

1646
01:15:49,578 --> 01:15:51,779
Actually, that's
just Bobby taking a pee.

1647
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:53,780
What?

1648
01:15:53,783 --> 01:15:55,283
Oh, come on, that's gross.

1649
01:15:55,284 --> 01:15:56,783
Kisha!
Kisha.

1650
01:15:56,786 --> 01:15:58,920
Kisha.
Show yourself.

1651
01:15:58,921 --> 01:16:01,122
Baby? Come on,
you gotta stay close.

1652
01:16:01,123 --> 01:16:03,925
What is this,
a Shake Weight
and a Thighmaster?

1653
01:16:03,926 --> 01:16:05,025
Nice.

1654
01:16:05,028 --> 01:16:06,661
Back the train up.
You got a Flowbee?

1655
01:16:06,662 --> 01:16:08,796
Hey, it all looks good
at 2:00 in the morning, okay?

1656
01:16:08,797 --> 01:16:10,997
Hey, look, Malcolm,
one's white and one's black.

1657
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,699
- Guess which one you are.
- Black one.

1658
01:16:12,702 --> 01:16:15,269
What the hell?
Can we just go
find my girl, please?

1659
01:16:15,270 --> 01:16:16,337
Thank you.

1660
01:16:18,105 --> 01:16:19,907
Kisha!
Bobby!

1661
01:16:19,908 --> 01:16:21,876
Would you shut the fuck up?
What are you doing?

1662
01:16:21,877 --> 01:16:23,310
Come on.

1663
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:26,581
Go, go, go.

1664
01:16:28,917 --> 01:16:30,016
What was that?

1665
01:16:32,154 --> 01:16:34,087
Christ,
that bitch is scary.

1666
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:35,221
I dropped the camera!

1667
01:16:36,324 --> 01:16:37,824
Fellas?

1668
01:16:40,595 --> 01:16:41,862
Kisha.

1669
01:16:52,173 --> 01:16:55,643
Malcolm? Malcolm?

1670
01:16:57,244 --> 01:17:01,681
It's me, Chip the Psychic.
Malcolm?

1671
01:17:04,252 --> 01:17:05,953
It's me, Chip.

1672
01:17:05,954 --> 01:17:07,087
Yoo-hoo.

1673
01:17:09,859 --> 01:17:13,060
- Okay, I found the camera.
- What are you guys doing?

1674
01:17:13,061 --> 01:17:14,228
This shit is real, son.

1675
01:17:14,229 --> 01:17:15,630
Yeah.

1676
01:17:15,631 --> 01:17:17,297
Chip, why are you naked?

1677
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:19,000
What the hell?
Hey!

1678
01:17:19,002 --> 01:17:21,135
It got really hot in here.

1679
01:17:21,136 --> 01:17:23,404
Oh, no. Where's Bobby?

1680
01:17:25,807 --> 01:17:26,907
Found my Walkman.

1681
01:17:28,043 --> 01:17:31,679
Kisha? Baby, are you okay?

1682
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:32,680
- Leave her alone.
- Don't touch her.

1683
01:17:32,681 --> 01:17:34,215
Why?

1684
01:17:34,216 --> 01:17:35,815
'Cause she's like
that witch in  <i>Left 4 Dead</i>

1685
01:17:35,818 --> 01:17:37,184
sitting in the corner
crying like that.

1686
01:17:37,185 --> 01:17:39,119
You touch her,
she gonna attack your ass.

1687
01:17:39,122 --> 01:17:40,820
I can't just
leave her, man.

1688
01:17:40,823 --> 01:17:44,057
Kisha? Baby?
It'll be okay, all right?

1689
01:17:47,796 --> 01:17:49,930
Get off my man, bitch!

1690
01:17:52,167 --> 01:17:54,402
You wanna fight?
Take that, demon!

1691
01:17:55,369 --> 01:17:56,936
Elbow smash!

1692
01:17:56,939 --> 01:17:58,706
Ooh!

1693
01:17:58,707 --> 01:18:00,073
Harder!
Beast!

1694
01:18:01,443 --> 01:18:02,909
Take that, demon!

1695
01:18:02,912 --> 01:18:04,345
Fucking bitch, take that.

1696
01:18:06,015 --> 01:18:07,148
That demon can
take a punch.

1697
01:18:07,149 --> 01:18:08,248
That's enough.

1698
01:18:08,949 --> 01:18:10,784
- Baby?
- Malcolm.

1699
01:18:10,787 --> 01:18:12,752
I think she's okay.
Maybe not!

1700
01:18:15,356 --> 01:18:16,690
I won't tell on you,
you don't tell on me.

1701
01:18:16,693 --> 01:18:17,957
Understand me?

1702
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:19,159
You weren't here,
I wasn't here.

1703
01:18:19,162 --> 01:18:20,194
I'll take the blame.
I'll take the blame.

1704
01:18:20,195 --> 01:18:22,328
Okay, good. Hey!

1705
01:18:22,331 --> 01:18:23,831
Man, put some clothes on!

1706
01:18:36,144 --> 01:18:37,877
Hey.
Hey.

1707
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:40,314
You know what?
This  <i>Angry Birds</i>
<i>is kind of fun.</i>

1708
01:18:40,315 --> 01:18:42,115
I told you.
 I like it.

1709
01:18:42,118 --> 01:18:44,118
Look at you
looking all pretty.

1710
01:18:44,119 --> 01:18:47,488
Oh, this?
It's just a little something
I put on for my man.

1711
01:18:47,489 --> 01:18:49,023
Oh, lucky him.

1712
01:18:49,024 --> 01:18:50,725
Oh. Ow...

1713
01:18:50,726 --> 01:18:52,158
Malcolm.
What? What? What?

1714
01:18:52,161 --> 01:18:54,161
My ribs are
still a little sore.

1715
01:18:54,162 --> 01:18:57,198
I'm sorry.
We did beat the hell
out of you, girl.

1716
01:18:57,199 --> 01:18:59,233
We was just trying
to get the demon out.
I'm sorry.

1717
01:18:59,234 --> 01:19:02,770
No, I'm sorry for bringing
that thing into your house.

1718
01:19:02,771 --> 01:19:04,305
Our house.

1719
01:19:05,039 --> 01:19:06,207
Mmm!

1720
01:19:08,243 --> 01:19:11,212
Malcolm?
Is the camera on?
Mm-hmm?

1721
01:19:14,949 --> 01:19:16,216
Fine.

1722
01:19:16,484 --> 01:19:17,851
Good.

1723
01:19:20,188 --> 01:19:21,387
Come here.

1724
01:19:23,524 --> 01:19:26,226
Take like that,
take it like that.

1725
01:19:26,229 --> 01:19:28,362
Oh, my God,
I hit the bottom.

1726
01:19:28,363 --> 01:19:30,831
Oh, yeah, take that.
Who's your dirty daddy?

1727
01:19:35,837 --> 01:19:37,537
Oh, God.

1728
01:19:37,539 --> 01:19:39,873
- I got a cramp.
-  Don't touch it.

1729
01:20:26,087 --> 01:20:29,155
Malcolm!

1730
01:20:29,158 --> 01:20:31,958
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm coming.

1731
01:20:31,961 --> 01:20:33,194
Shit.

1732
01:20:37,565 --> 01:20:40,167
Malcolm!

1733
01:20:40,168 --> 01:20:42,603
I heard you
the first time.
Damn.

1734
01:21:17,471 --> 01:21:19,038
She's gone.

1735
01:21:22,577 --> 01:21:25,345
Yeah, baby, I lived!
I lived.

1736
01:21:25,347 --> 01:21:27,648
In your face.
In your face!

1737
01:21:27,649 --> 01:21:29,515
You thought you'd
move into my house
and kill me?

1738
01:21:29,518 --> 01:21:30,650
What?

1739
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:35,389
She's right behind me,
isn't she?

1740
01:23:22,296 --> 01:23:23,997
Oh, yeah.

1741
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,500
We gonna need a wide angle
for some of
these aerial tricks.

1742
01:23:26,502 --> 01:23:29,069
All right, I call
this one "The Superman."

1743
01:23:30,338 --> 01:23:33,439
Pile driver!
 Take that.
Take that.

1744
01:23:33,675 --> 01:23:35,208
Oh! Oh!

1745
01:23:37,546 --> 01:23:40,247
Can I get you
something to drink, Father?

1746
01:23:40,248 --> 01:23:42,515
Yeah, Hennessy, straight.

1747
01:23:42,518 --> 01:23:45,019
Oh, you got Hpnotiq?
I like to mix them.

1748
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:47,121
Uh, I was
talking about water.

1749
01:23:47,122 --> 01:23:50,289
Water?
I don't drink that bullshit.
What the fuck?

1750
01:23:50,292 --> 01:23:52,760
Yeah, my show is
gonna be huge.

1751
01:23:52,761 --> 01:23:55,595
I'm gonna get my house back.
I'm gonna get a girlfriend.

1752
01:23:55,597 --> 01:23:57,163
I'm gonna be successful.

1753
01:23:57,166 --> 01:24:01,201
Did you just hope
and dream out loud?

1754
01:24:02,804 --> 01:24:05,706
All hopes and dreams
are out loud.
That's the camera show.

1755
01:24:05,707 --> 01:24:08,809
Oh, this is called "68,"
and I owe you one.

1756
01:24:08,810 --> 01:24:12,779
You're crazy, girl.
Yeah, I'll fart in your face.

1757
01:24:12,782 --> 01:24:16,050
Take that.
Now we gonna make some love.

1758
01:24:16,051 --> 01:24:17,417
But I ain't gonna
kiss you on your mouth

1759
01:24:17,420 --> 01:24:19,185
'cause I just
farted in your face.

1760
01:24:19,188 --> 01:24:22,588
Here's the thing.
A lot of people
think penises are scary.

1761
01:24:22,591 --> 01:24:26,060
They're not,
unless it has a gun.
Then that's horrifying.

1762
01:24:26,061 --> 01:24:29,229
90% of penises
don't carry a gun.

1763
01:24:29,230 --> 01:24:31,097
Oh, my God. What?

1764
01:24:31,100 --> 01:24:32,565
That's a fact.

1765
01:24:32,568 --> 01:24:34,501
But I'm gonna
tell you this,
don't ever,

1766
01:24:34,502 --> 01:24:36,470
ever let a man put
his hands on you.

1767
01:24:36,471 --> 01:24:38,572
Unless he
paying the bills. Aah!

1768
01:24:38,573 --> 01:24:40,474
Domestic violence
is amazing.

1769
01:24:43,344 --> 01:24:45,645
Gonna burn me.

1770
01:24:50,085 --> 01:24:53,353
I'm sorry. Shh. Shh.
Take it.

1771
01:24:53,654 --> 01:24:55,189
Ooh.

1772
01:24:56,423 --> 01:24:57,757
Ooh!

1773
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:01,627
This is one bad
picture right here, nigger.

1774
01:25:01,630 --> 01:25:04,864
This a fine motherfucker
right here, boy.
This is dope.

1775
01:25:04,867 --> 01:25:06,365
You know what
I'd do with this?

1776
01:25:06,368 --> 01:25:08,268
Do you know what
I'd do with this?

1777
01:25:08,270 --> 01:25:11,337
All this area,
all this carpet,
this ottoman,

1778
01:25:11,340 --> 01:25:12,405
I'd be all over it.

1779
01:25:12,408 --> 01:25:14,207
What are these?

1780
01:25:14,210 --> 01:25:16,109
Those are my boxers.

1781
01:25:16,112 --> 01:25:17,578
Fascinating.

1782
01:25:17,579 --> 01:25:19,579
Oh, yes.

1783
01:25:19,582 --> 01:25:22,448
His methods are
so unorthodox.

1784
01:25:22,451 --> 01:25:24,618
That's my girlfriend.

1785
01:25:24,619 --> 01:25:26,653
Ah...
Kisha.

1786
01:25:26,654 --> 01:25:29,590
That's a crazy
bitch name all day.
You can google it.

1787
01:25:29,591 --> 01:25:34,127
Top five crazy bitch names.
Kisha, Alisha, Djuana.

1788
01:25:34,130 --> 01:25:36,829
You say that out loud,
and you're
already scared, right?

1789
01:25:36,832 --> 01:25:38,564
Are you done?

1790
01:25:38,567 --> 01:25:40,134
Let's go.
Let's go save the bitch.
