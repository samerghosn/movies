1
00:00:17,065 --> 00:00:19,150
Finally...

2
00:00:19,568 --> 00:00:22,153
the warring nations of earth had
forgotten their differences...

3
00:00:22,571 --> 00:00:25,157
and banded together
to save our planet.

4
00:00:26,574 --> 00:00:31,245
The United Global Space Force
was searching the galaxy...

5
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:34,164
for worlds rich with drinkable
water and breathable air.

6
00:00:34,582 --> 00:00:38,210
The hypergate was our best hope
to colonize space...

7
00:00:38,543 --> 00:00:39,085
our best hope for survival.

8
00:00:39,545 --> 00:00:41,130
But as we prepared
to launch ourselves...

9
00:00:41,546 --> 00:00:43,131
into the black of space...

10
00:00:44,548 --> 00:00:48,177
terrorists, calling themselves
"The Global Sedition..."

11
00:00:48,552 --> 00:00:50,095
were preparing to strike.

12
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,146
Grissom base, this is Cargo 7
requesting landing clearance.

13
00:00:59,563 --> 00:01:01,106
Roger, transport.
This is Grissom gate control.

14
00:01:01,523 --> 00:01:02,064
Please download security codes.

15
00:01:03,524 --> 00:01:04,067
Downloading.

16
00:01:04,525 --> 00:01:07,153
Transport, I've got two blips
inside your radar signature.

17
00:01:07,528 --> 00:01:08,070
They're hiding in your shadow.

18
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:09,072
I don't see anything.

19
00:01:14,534 --> 00:01:17,162
This is gate control.
Battle stations.

20
00:01:21,542 --> 00:01:22,042
Battle stations.

21
00:01:22,543 --> 00:01:25,128
Two Sedition fighters
are attacking the hypergate.

22
00:01:25,545 --> 00:01:26,045
Battle stations.

23
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:28,088
Gate control, this is Eagle One.
I'm locked and loaded.

24
00:01:28,548 --> 00:01:30,091
Ready to fly.

25
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:32,093
Roger, Eagle One.
You're clear to launch.

26
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:39,098
Jeb, where are you, buddy?

27
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:43,145
This cold war just got hot.

28
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:45,104
They're Sedition raiders.

29
00:01:45,521 --> 00:01:47,106
It's another
mutant suicide squad.

30
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,109
Here we go. Man-to-man.
Split them up.

31
00:01:51,527 --> 00:01:55,197
Last one to kill a bad guy
buys the beer.

32
00:01:58,533 --> 00:02:00,076
I'm gonna go through the gate,
get in front of him.

33
00:02:00,536 --> 00:02:03,162
That's not standard procedure,
Don.

34
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,084
I'm gettin' some heat.

35
00:02:17,509 --> 00:02:19,093
You gen-techs are ugly up close.

36
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:20,054
Target lock.

37
00:02:20,512 --> 00:02:21,054
Show time.

38
00:02:29,521 --> 00:02:31,063
Bogey One dispatched.

39
00:02:32,522 --> 00:02:35,109
Don, he's right on my tail.

40
00:02:35,526 --> 00:02:37,069
Damn! Can't shake him.

41
00:02:42,533 --> 00:02:44,075
I've been hit!

42
00:02:44,533 --> 00:02:45,034
Weapons are off-line.

43
00:02:46,536 --> 00:02:48,079
I'm gonna jettison
the main drive core.

44
00:02:48,496 --> 00:02:49,038
There you are.

45
00:02:56,503 --> 00:02:58,087
Am I good or what?

46
00:02:58,504 --> 00:03:01,133
Warning. Failure
in redundant drive systems.

47
00:03:01,508 --> 00:03:03,050
Gate control,
this is Ranger One.

48
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:05,052
Engines will not respond.

49
00:03:06,513 --> 00:03:09,139
Don, I'm falling
towards the hypergate.

50
00:03:10,515 --> 00:03:12,060
Breaking thrusters won't fire!

51
00:03:12,518 --> 00:03:15,103
Impact in 30 seconds.

52
00:03:15,521 --> 00:03:16,021
Ranger One, this is base.

53
00:03:16,521 --> 00:03:18,064
Rescue craft
have been dispatched.

54
00:03:20,484 --> 00:03:24,153
Grissom, those pods will never
reach him in time.

55
00:03:24,487 --> 00:03:25,030
I'm going in.

56
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:28,115
Major West, you are not
authorized to jeopardize--

57
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:29,033
Never liked that station anyway.

58
00:03:29,491 --> 00:03:33,162
Warning. Proximity alert.

59
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,000
Hang on, Jeb. I'm coming in.

60
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,086
Abort. Abort!

61
00:03:41,502 --> 00:03:44,088
I'll give you a little kiss.
Don't take this the wrong way.

62
00:03:44,506 --> 00:03:46,049
Impact in five seconds.

63
00:04:05,525 --> 00:04:07,151
Does this mean
we're going steady?

64
00:04:07,568 --> 00:04:10,153
You're not getting out
of buying those beers that easy.

65
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:26,168
With intrepid pioneering spirit,
the Robinson family...

66
00:04:26,627 --> 00:04:29,213
will journey to the distant
world of Alpha Prime.

67
00:04:29,588 --> 00:04:32,216
What kind of future can
our children look forward to?

68
00:04:32,632 --> 00:04:34,177
A future in paradise.

69
00:04:35,593 --> 00:04:36,137
The Jupiter mission...

70
00:04:36,595 --> 00:04:40,264
made possible by the Army and
Silicon Graphics Corporation.

71
00:04:40,598 --> 00:04:44,269
S.G.I. Saving the future
for our children.

72
00:04:44,603 --> 00:04:46,187
Give me a break.

73
00:04:46,605 --> 00:04:48,189
Holo-call
from Houston middle school.

74
00:04:48,605 --> 00:04:50,191
Hello?

75
00:04:50,608 --> 00:04:51,108
Hello, Principal Cartwright.

76
00:04:51,608 --> 00:04:54,237
What has he done this time?

77
00:04:54,612 --> 00:04:58,240
He hacked our main power grid
to run his experiment.

78
00:04:59,615 --> 00:05:00,117
The school was in chaos.

79
00:05:01,617 --> 00:05:03,161
Yeah, right.

80
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,163
We didn't even have lights.

81
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:12,252
This is no laughing matter,
Professor Robinson.

82
00:05:12,586 --> 00:05:16,257
Will is terribly gifted.

83
00:05:16,589 --> 00:05:18,175
The changing shape of education.

84
00:05:18,591 --> 00:05:21,220
His little time machines,
though pure fancy...

85
00:05:21,595 --> 00:05:24,221
are the products
of a truly brilliant mind.

86
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,143
No more monkey business.

87
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,144
I mean it.

88
00:05:30,603 --> 00:05:32,146
The boy is starved
for attention.

89
00:05:33,605 --> 00:05:36,192
I know your life is anything
but normal right now...

90
00:05:36,567 --> 00:05:38,151
but wasn't there some way...

91
00:05:38,569 --> 00:05:41,196
his father could have
attended the science fair?

92
00:05:41,572 --> 00:05:43,156
As you are aware...

93
00:05:43,572 --> 00:05:46,201
Alpha Prime is the only other
habitable planet...

94
00:05:46,576 --> 00:05:50,245
yet detected
by deep space recon.

95
00:05:51,581 --> 00:05:55,250
My crew will sleep away
our 10-year journey there...

96
00:05:55,584 --> 00:05:56,084
in suspended animation.

97
00:05:57,586 --> 00:06:01,255
Once we have rendezvoused with
the research colony on Alpha...

98
00:06:01,589 --> 00:06:03,175
I will supervise
construction of a hypergate.

99
00:06:03,591 --> 00:06:07,220
By then,
technicians here on Earth...

100
00:06:07,595 --> 00:06:10,180
will have completed
the companion hypergate...

101
00:06:10,598 --> 00:06:12,141
in our planet's orbit.

102
00:06:14,601 --> 00:06:15,101
Once both gates are complete...

103
00:06:17,605 --> 00:06:21,233
ships will be able to pass
instantaneously between them.

104
00:06:21,567 --> 00:06:25,237
Immediate colonization
of Alpha Prime will be possible.

105
00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:28,197
Can't you just use
the Jupiter's hyper-engine...

106
00:06:28,572 --> 00:06:30,115
to zap straight to Alpha Prime?

107
00:06:31,576 --> 00:06:34,202
Hyperspace exists
beneath normal space.

108
00:06:34,579 --> 00:06:37,206
If you try to enter hyperspace
without a gate...

109
00:06:38,581 --> 00:06:40,125
your exit factor is random.

110
00:06:40,584 --> 00:06:42,127
There's no telling
where you'd come out.

111
00:06:42,586 --> 00:06:46,213
Ninety-eight percent of
the galaxy is still uncharted.

112
00:06:46,548 --> 00:06:48,132
There's a lot of space
to get lost in.

113
00:06:51,552 --> 00:06:53,137
How is Captain Daniels
recovering from the flu?

114
00:06:53,553 --> 00:06:55,139
Will he pilot the mission?

115
00:06:55,555 --> 00:06:57,141
Ladies and gentlemen.

116
00:06:57,557 --> 00:07:01,228
You came to get your first look
at the Jupiter 1.

117
00:07:01,562 --> 00:07:03,146
Don't you think
you've waited long enough?

118
00:07:04,564 --> 00:07:06,149
Let's move into the launch dome.

119
00:07:06,565 --> 00:07:07,067
One more question, Professor.

120
00:07:07,567 --> 00:07:10,153
Now that the mission's
been pushed up...

121
00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:13,156
how do your children feel
about leaving the earth behind?

122
00:07:13,572 --> 00:07:16,158
They couldn't be more excited.

123
00:07:17,576 --> 00:07:19,119
This mission sucks!

124
00:07:19,577 --> 00:07:22,163
I don't wanna leave early.
I don't wanna go at all.

125
00:07:22,581 --> 00:07:23,081
We will discuss this at dinner.

126
00:07:24,582 --> 00:07:28,211
For the last three years, I've
missed everything training...

127
00:07:28,586 --> 00:07:30,129
so I can spend the next 10 years
missing everything else.

128
00:07:32,548 --> 00:07:34,132
I'm not staying home for dinner.

129
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:35,091
I'm seeing my friends.

130
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,136
Penny.

131
00:07:37,552 --> 00:07:41,180
I'm going out to say good-bye
to my entire life.

132
00:07:42,557 --> 00:07:45,185
Penny, I need you here tonight.
Wait a minute.

133
00:07:52,567 --> 00:07:56,194
On this eve, before she's torn
from everything she knows--

134
00:07:56,528 --> 00:07:58,112
kidnapped...

135
00:07:58,529 --> 00:08:01,158
hurled into deep space
against her will--

136
00:08:01,533 --> 00:08:04,161
what thoughts fill the mind
of the daring space captive?

137
00:08:04,536 --> 00:08:06,120
Are there boys on Alpha Prime?

138
00:08:06,538 --> 00:08:08,122
What will I wear?

139
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:15,211
What will it be like to jettison
your body into deep space?

140
00:08:16,547 --> 00:08:20,216
First...
you'll try holding your breath.

141
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:23,136
But your blood's
already begun to boil.

142
00:08:23,552 --> 00:08:28,223
Then your skin inflates
like a balloon.

143
00:08:28,557 --> 00:08:30,100
Then...pop.

144
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,061
Do they have a name
for what's wrong with you?

145
00:08:36,565 --> 00:08:38,107
Dad says don't bring them.

146
00:08:38,524 --> 00:08:40,110
Like anything I do
matters to him.

147
00:08:40,527 --> 00:08:43,154
Don't sweat it, kid.

148
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:47,200
I got apology videos
for two birthdays.

149
00:08:47,533 --> 00:08:49,076
He forgot last year completely.

150
00:08:50,536 --> 00:08:53,163
This mission's the only thing
he cares about anymore.

151
00:08:59,544 --> 00:09:01,087
So that's a no to family dinner?

152
00:09:01,547 --> 00:09:03,090
Let's see.

153
00:09:03,506 --> 00:09:05,091
Do I spend my last night
on Earth...

154
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:09,178
watching Mom and Dad pretend
not to be fighting again...

155
00:09:09,511 --> 00:09:12,139
or blow 10 years worth
of allowance at the mall?

156
00:09:13,515 --> 00:09:15,100
You do the math.

157
00:09:15,518 --> 00:09:16,059
Mom's gonna go thermal.

158
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,104
What's she gonna do,
ground me?

159
00:09:20,522 --> 00:09:23,149
I'm nervous about jamming in
a new pilot the last second.

160
00:09:23,524 --> 00:09:25,110
The Global Sedition
is getting brave.

161
00:09:25,527 --> 00:09:27,111
First the hypergate,
then Daniels.

162
00:09:27,528 --> 00:09:30,155
Next time, they may attack
the launch dome.

163
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:31,032
We can't afford to wait.

164
00:09:31,532 --> 00:09:35,161
Will's science fair. Reminder.
Apology video for Will.

165
00:09:35,536 --> 00:09:37,078
He'll understand.

166
00:09:37,538 --> 00:09:38,038
Ben, listen.

167
00:09:38,538 --> 00:09:41,125
My family is on this mission.

168
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,086
I need a pilot who's
more than just spit and polish.

169
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:46,086
I've got your man.

170
00:09:46,504 --> 00:09:48,088
He just doesn't know it yet.

171
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,052
At ease, Major.

172
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:56,096
Why was I pulled
from active duty?

173
00:09:56,514 --> 00:09:58,057
Those gen-techs
may attack again.

174
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:00,058
I need to be up there.

175
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,059
Do you know Professor Robinson?

176
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:05,147
By reputation. Your father's
battle strategies...

177
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:07,065
were required reading
at the academy.

178
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:11,110
What can you tell me
about the Jupiter mission?

179
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:14,071
The Jupiter
is an oversized robot.

180
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:16,032
Everything's automatic.

181
00:10:18,491 --> 00:10:19,033
Any monkey in a flight suit...

182
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:22,120
can pilot that ship
out of the solar system...

183
00:10:22,495 --> 00:10:24,081
and set her down on Alpha Prime.

184
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:27,125
It's a baby-sitting job, sir.

185
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,043
No offense.

186
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,171
Major, are you aware Earth's
resources are severely limited?

187
00:10:32,504 --> 00:10:34,048
Every schoolchild knows...

188
00:10:34,506 --> 00:10:37,092
that our recycling technologies
will cure the environment.

189
00:10:38,509 --> 00:10:40,053
Sending a family
across the galaxy...

190
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:43,097
is a stunt to sell computers
to people of all ages.

191
00:10:43,514 --> 00:10:45,057
Every schoolchild was lied to.

192
00:10:45,517 --> 00:10:48,102
Recycling technologies
came too late.

193
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:51,105
All fossil fuels
are virtually exhausted.

194
00:10:51,522 --> 00:10:53,065
The ozone layer is down to 40%%%.

195
00:10:53,524 --> 00:11:00,279
In two decades, the earth will
be unable to support human life.

196
00:11:00,489 --> 00:11:03,115
The new Global Sedition knows
the truth as well as we do.

197
00:11:03,491 --> 00:11:05,076
They're building
their own hypergate.

198
00:11:05,494 --> 00:11:08,120
They hope to colonize
Alpha Prime first.

199
00:11:08,495 --> 00:11:10,038
If they're successful...

200
00:11:10,498 --> 00:11:12,041
western demons like you and l,
Major West...

201
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,043
will be left on Earth to die.

202
00:11:14,501 --> 00:11:17,086
Captain Daniels doesn't have
the flu, does he?

203
00:11:17,504 --> 00:11:20,090
Captain Daniels was murdered
in his apartment last night.

204
00:11:20,506 --> 00:11:22,049
The flu story is a cover.

205
00:11:23,467 --> 00:11:25,052
I flew with Mike.

206
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:28,097
We should blast their bases!
A decisive strike now!

207
00:11:28,472 --> 00:11:30,057
My squadron is alert status--

208
00:11:30,475 --> 00:11:32,059
Your rescue stunt was foolhardy!

209
00:11:32,476 --> 00:11:34,061
I had a friend in trouble.

210
00:11:34,477 --> 00:11:37,105
So you endangered
a $10-billion spacecraft...

211
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,066
disobeyed a direct order
because of a friend?

212
00:11:41,485 --> 00:11:41,985
I did...

213
00:11:43,486 --> 00:11:43,986
sir.

214
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:47,990
He'll do.

215
00:11:53,495 --> 00:11:53,995
Congratulations.

216
00:11:54,496 --> 00:11:57,081
You're the new pilot
of the Jupiter mission.

217
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,086
Where's my money?

218
00:12:07,466 --> 00:12:10,135
The Sedition hired me
to provide access...

219
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,096
to Daniels' apartment
and no more.

220
00:12:12,471 --> 00:12:14,097
My work is done.

221
00:12:16,517 --> 00:12:18,059
They found a replacement pilot.

222
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:20,062
Our attack
on the hypergate failed.

223
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,063
How tragic for you.

224
00:12:23,523 --> 00:12:27,192
We require a more direct
intervention on your part.

225
00:12:27,568 --> 00:12:29,111
I see.

226
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:33,157
It will cost you.

227
00:12:35,576 --> 00:12:39,245
I'm afraid that my price
has just become...

228
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,121
astronomical.

229
00:12:42,582 --> 00:12:43,125
Holograph off.

230
00:12:53,592 --> 00:12:54,092
Come in.

231
00:12:59,597 --> 00:13:03,225
Control hasn't received
results of the preflight exams.

232
00:13:03,601 --> 00:13:06,187
The Robinsons
have checked out 100%%%.

233
00:13:09,606 --> 00:13:12,192
They're fit as a fiddle
and ready to fly.

234
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:13,110
Wish them luck...

235
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:16,154
for me.

236
00:13:22,577 --> 00:13:25,205
Mission protocols are simple.
Robinson is in command...

237
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,123
unless you encounter
a military emergency.

238
00:13:27,581 --> 00:13:29,125
In that case, Major West,
you are in charge.

239
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:32,211
I'm a fighter pilot.
There must be better candidates.

240
00:13:32,586 --> 00:13:34,129
Hell, even my own family
can't stand me.

241
00:13:34,588 --> 00:13:36,131
Shut up.

242
00:13:39,551 --> 00:13:41,135
Jeb Walker.
He's an excellent flyer.

243
00:13:42,553 --> 00:13:43,096
He's perfect for this mission.

244
00:13:43,554 --> 00:13:44,096
Welcome aboard, Major.

245
00:14:03,572 --> 00:14:05,158
Looks like somebody sprung
for the full-extras package...

246
00:14:05,575 --> 00:14:06,076
on this beauty.

247
00:14:06,576 --> 00:14:10,205
If you have to be a baby-sitter,
it's not such a bad nursery.

248
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,123
Wouldn't you agree?

249
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:15,083
I don't get it.

250
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:18,169
I can't get the cryo-sleep
systems up over 96%%%.

251
00:14:18,586 --> 00:14:20,129
Dr. Smith approved the specs.

252
00:14:20,588 --> 00:14:24,216
Dr. Smith is the base physician.
I am responsible in flight.

253
00:14:24,551 --> 00:14:26,135
These tubes will be perfect,
or the ship will not launch.

254
00:14:26,552 --> 00:14:28,138
Is that clear?

255
00:14:28,554 --> 00:14:30,139
Absolutely, Doctor.

256
00:14:30,557 --> 00:14:34,226
Judy, I want to introduce you
to Major West.

257
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:36,102
He'll be taking Mike's place.

258
00:14:39,565 --> 00:14:41,107
He's heavier than Mike.
We'll have to recalibrate.

259
00:14:42,567 --> 00:14:45,153
I'd be happy to discuss
my dimensions, Doctor...

260
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:46,071
say, over dinner?

261
00:14:47,572 --> 00:14:49,115
West.
I've read about you.

262
00:14:49,532 --> 00:14:51,116
You're a war hero, aren't you?

263
00:14:51,533 --> 00:14:54,161
Well, yes, actually.

264
00:14:55,538 --> 00:14:58,164
Who was it who said,
"Those who can't think, fight"?

265
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:02,168
I think that it was me.

266
00:15:02,543 --> 00:15:04,129
It was nice to have met you.

267
00:15:08,549 --> 00:15:11,134
That's one cold fish
I'd love to thaw.

268
00:15:13,553 --> 00:15:16,139
I'm not gonna make it over
for dinner tonight, Dad.

269
00:15:26,566 --> 00:15:28,109
It's gonna be a long flight.

270
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:32,113
Maureen, pick up the phone,
honey.

271
00:15:32,529 --> 00:15:34,115
I know you're there.
Are you still packing?

272
00:15:34,532 --> 00:15:35,073
I'm just leaving.
Go to bed.

273
00:15:48,544 --> 00:15:49,086
Sweetie?

274
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:59,096
He won first prize again.

275
00:15:59,513 --> 00:16:01,097
Is this the new model
he's been working on?

276
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:08,104
Crazy idea he's got about a...

277
00:16:09,522 --> 00:16:11,106
time machine?

278
00:16:14,527 --> 00:16:16,111
Pretty sharp stuff for a midget.

279
00:16:18,529 --> 00:16:20,115
Sorry about dinner.
That new pilot--

280
00:16:20,532 --> 00:16:21,033
John, the family needs you here.

281
00:16:21,533 --> 00:16:24,119
This whole thing
is about family.

282
00:16:25,537 --> 00:16:27,080
My only condition
for accepting this mission...

283
00:16:27,538 --> 00:16:30,124
was that we could bring
the children with us...

284
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:31,042
not leave them behind...

285
00:16:31,542 --> 00:16:34,128
so future generations
would have a new home.

286
00:16:34,544 --> 00:16:37,130
You're off saving humanity,
so what does it matter...

287
00:16:37,548 --> 00:16:39,091
that Will
has to blackout his school...

288
00:16:39,549 --> 00:16:41,092
to get his father's attention...

289
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:45,179
Penny's been dragged home
by security 3 nights in a row...

290
00:16:45,514 --> 00:16:48,140
Judy's become a ghost,
like her father?

291
00:16:48,515 --> 00:16:50,100
I have to compensate
for the new launch time.

292
00:16:50,518 --> 00:16:51,059
What do you think I'm doing?

293
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:53,062
Revising life-science protocols.

294
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,063
I'm also dealing
with two kids...

295
00:16:55,523 --> 00:16:58,149
who are leaving
an entire planet behind.

296
00:16:58,524 --> 00:17:01,110
Sorry, but there's no manuals
on how to deal with this.

297
00:17:05,531 --> 00:17:07,075
Maybe it doesn't do any good...

298
00:17:10,494 --> 00:17:14,164
saving a world of families
if we can't save our own.

299
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,086
Is that it, Professor?

300
00:17:23,507 --> 00:17:24,007
John.

301
00:17:25,509 --> 00:17:27,093
I know, baby.
I'm scared, too.

302
00:17:56,494 --> 00:17:58,079
Med supplies for the Jupiter 2?

303
00:17:58,497 --> 00:18:00,082
That's what it looks like.

304
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,041
They're not taking any chances.

305
00:18:51,503 --> 00:18:55,132
Forgive me if I forego the kiss,
my sleeping behemoth...

306
00:18:55,508 --> 00:18:58,093
but the time has come to awake.

307
00:18:58,469 --> 00:19:00,054
Robot is on-line.

308
00:19:00,471 --> 00:19:02,055
Reviewing primary directives.

309
00:19:02,471 --> 00:19:06,142
One--
preserve the Robinson family.

310
00:19:06,476 --> 00:19:08,060
Two--
maintain the ship's systems.

311
00:19:08,478 --> 00:19:12,147
Spare me the chatter,
my steely centurion.

312
00:19:12,481 --> 00:19:17,193
Sadly, I fear I have far more
dire deeds in store for you.

313
00:19:18,487 --> 00:19:20,029
Robot is on-line.

314
00:19:20,489 --> 00:19:22,031
Reviewing primary directives.

315
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:25,076
Sixteen hours into mission,
destroy Robinson family.

316
00:19:25,451 --> 00:19:28,078
Destroy all systems.

317
00:19:28,454 --> 00:19:30,038
That's more like it.

318
00:19:30,455 --> 00:19:33,084
Farewell,
my platinum-plated pal.

319
00:19:35,461 --> 00:19:38,087
Give my regards to oblivion.

320
00:19:46,471 --> 00:19:51,142
Apparently you have completed
your mission on schedule.

321
00:19:51,476 --> 00:19:55,104
I do so admire a spot
of timely terrorism.

322
00:19:55,479 --> 00:19:58,065
I thought I told you
never to call me here.

323
00:19:58,481 --> 00:20:00,025
The transmission signal
will be traced.

324
00:20:01,484 --> 00:20:05,113
I just wanted to express
my most sincere gratitude...

325
00:20:05,446 --> 00:20:08,074
for your unflagging loyalty.

326
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:11,076
Good work, good doctor...

327
00:20:11,451 --> 00:20:13,037
and good-bye.

328
00:20:28,509 --> 00:20:32,096
Jupiter 1 launch
in three minutes.

329
00:20:32,512 --> 00:20:34,056
Mom, just--

330
00:20:34,472 --> 00:20:35,016
Shoot.

331
00:20:35,473 --> 00:20:36,016
Mom, I'm fine.

332
00:20:36,517 --> 00:20:38,059
That's supposed to be there.

333
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:41,063
This is almost acceptable.

334
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,106
-Mom, don't.
-What?

335
00:20:44,482 --> 00:20:47,152
Vogue says this will be
the style in 10 years.

336
00:20:47,568 --> 00:20:48,068
Can we cut back on her oxygen...

337
00:20:48,569 --> 00:20:51,154
so she's not so annoying
when she wakes up?

338
00:20:51,572 --> 00:20:52,115
Does he have to wake up at all?

339
00:20:52,573 --> 00:20:55,159
That's it. I'm gonna turn
this spaceship around.

340
00:20:55,576 --> 00:20:59,246
Satellite defense net locked
and a-ok.

341
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,188
-Everything's gonna be fine.
-30 seconds. Mark.

342
00:21:27,564 --> 00:21:30,148
-Hey, there, buddy.
-Com-links encoded and secure.

343
00:21:30,567 --> 00:21:32,109
-Good night, guys.
-Good night.

344
00:21:32,567 --> 00:21:34,111
Here we go.

345
00:21:34,569 --> 00:21:36,113
Artificial gravity at 100%%%.

346
00:21:36,572 --> 00:21:38,115
You get a "C"
in paternal expression...

347
00:21:38,574 --> 00:21:41,160
but an "A" for effort.

348
00:21:41,576 --> 00:21:43,119
-I'm doing the best I can.
-Come here.

349
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,125
You always get an "A" in this.

350
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:52,127
Main drive systems on-line.

351
00:21:52,545 --> 00:21:54,130
Sweet dreams.

352
00:21:54,547 --> 00:21:55,088
See you there.

353
00:21:57,549 --> 00:22:01,220
You are at "T" minus one minute
and counting, Major West.

354
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,104
Houston, the bird is hot.

355
00:22:14,565 --> 00:22:15,066
She's all yours.

356
00:22:17,567 --> 00:22:20,153
I'll try to give you
a smooth ride.

357
00:22:26,534 --> 00:22:28,118
Mission control,
this is Dr. Robinson.

358
00:22:28,536 --> 00:22:29,077
We are in the green.

359
00:22:29,537 --> 00:22:33,207
Roger, Doctor. You are go
to initiate cryo-stasis.

360
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:38,086
One question.

361
00:22:39,546 --> 00:22:42,173
Is there room
in these tubes for two?

362
00:22:43,549 --> 00:22:46,135
There's barely enough
for you and your ego.

363
00:22:47,554 --> 00:22:49,096
Don't sweat it, doc.

364
00:22:49,556 --> 00:22:51,098
I do this all the time.

365
00:22:51,516 --> 00:22:53,099
Just drive carefully.

366
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:58,146
You are at "T" minus 40 seconds
and counting.

367
00:22:58,521 --> 00:22:59,064
Ready.

368
00:23:09,531 --> 00:23:12,117
You are at "T" minus
30 seconds and counting.

369
00:23:26,548 --> 00:23:29,134
You are at "T" minus
20 seconds and counting.

370
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:31,094
Control, this is Jupiter 1.

371
00:23:31,551 --> 00:23:32,052
The Robinsons are all tucked in.

372
00:23:32,552 --> 00:23:34,096
We are ready to fly.

373
00:23:34,512 --> 00:23:38,182
Major West, your escape vector
is clear of all traffic.

374
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:40,102
Op is go on your command.

375
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:42,104
Roger, Houston.

376
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,105
And the monkey flips the switch.

377
00:24:18,511 --> 00:24:21,097
Jupiter 1 boosters disengaged.

378
00:24:29,521 --> 00:24:31,065
This is Jupiter 2.

379
00:24:31,523 --> 00:24:34,109
Diverting all spacecraft control
to the main computer.

380
00:24:36,528 --> 00:24:38,072
Eight years of flight training.

381
00:24:41,532 --> 00:24:44,118
Navigational holographics
on-line.

382
00:24:44,493 --> 00:24:45,036
Fifty combat missions.

383
00:24:48,498 --> 00:24:51,125
Course confirmed for slingshot
exit of the solar system.

384
00:24:53,502 --> 00:24:57,131
So I can take the family camper
on an interstellar picnic.

385
00:25:00,509 --> 00:25:03,095
Ten years is a lifetime.

386
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:06,056
Sleep well, old friend.

387
00:25:08,516 --> 00:25:10,058
I never liked
these freezing tubes.

388
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,021
Bad dreams.

389
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:27,157
Navigational interface
confirmed.

390
00:25:27,491 --> 00:25:30,077
Cryo-sleep systems are 100%%%.

391
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:10,990
Shit!

392
00:26:17,496 --> 00:26:19,038
Robot is on-line.

393
00:26:19,455 --> 00:26:22,084
Sixteen hours into mission,
destroy Robinson family.

394
00:26:22,459 --> 00:26:24,044
Destroy all systems.

395
00:26:24,461 --> 00:26:27,087
Disable program !

396
00:26:27,463 --> 00:26:30,090
Sixteen hours into mission,
destroy Robinson family.

397
00:26:30,465 --> 00:26:32,050
Destroy all systems.

398
00:26:33,469 --> 00:26:35,054
Robot is on-line.

399
00:26:35,471 --> 00:26:35,971
Destroy.

400
00:26:41,476 --> 00:26:44,061
Destroy all operating systems.

401
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:46,021
Destroy Jupiter 2.

402
00:26:50,484 --> 00:26:53,069
Destroy all operating systems.

403
00:26:53,488 --> 00:26:55,030
Destroy Jupiter 2.

404
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:58,075
Destroy cryo-sleep systems.

405
00:27:03,454 --> 00:27:05,039
Destroy.

406
00:27:13,463 --> 00:27:15,007
Destroy navigational systems.

407
00:27:17,468 --> 00:27:20,095
Come on!
Wake up, damn you!

408
00:27:22,471 --> 00:27:25,057
I can't stop this infernal
contraption on my own.

409
00:27:30,438 --> 00:27:34,107
Emergency cryo-stasis
desequencing in process.

410
00:27:34,442 --> 00:27:37,068
Destroy all systems.

411
00:27:37,443 --> 00:27:39,028
Destroy Robinson family.

412
00:27:39,445 --> 00:27:41,030
Maureen, the children!

413
00:27:41,448 --> 00:27:41,990
Destroy.

414
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:43,991
Run!

415
00:27:45,451 --> 00:27:47,037
-Destroy.
-Deactivate safety.

416
00:27:52,458 --> 00:27:55,044
That was a mistake.

417
00:28:04,469 --> 00:28:06,011
Dad!

418
00:28:09,473 --> 00:28:11,017
Mom, let's go!

419
00:28:11,433 --> 00:28:15,104
-Will, stop!
-Destroy.

420
00:28:33,453 --> 00:28:34,997
Destroy Jupiter 2.

421
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:41,044
Destroy Robinson family.

422
00:28:55,473 --> 00:28:57,058
Look away, baby.

423
00:28:58,477 --> 00:29:01,063
Robot, disable pulse blaster.

424
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:01,980
Command accepted.

425
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,023
Cancel attack sequence
and stand by.

426
00:29:07,484 --> 00:29:10,153
If the family won't come
to the science fair...

427
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:13,156
bring the science fair
to the family.

428
00:29:14,575 --> 00:29:16,117
Showoff.

429
00:29:17,577 --> 00:29:18,077
Robot.

430
00:29:18,578 --> 00:29:20,122
On-line. Standing by.

431
00:29:20,538 --> 00:29:23,165
Return to docking bay
and power down.

432
00:29:23,541 --> 00:29:25,126
Major, you all right?

433
00:29:25,544 --> 00:29:28,171
Next picnic, no robots.

434
00:29:29,547 --> 00:29:31,089
Where's Judy?

435
00:29:34,551 --> 00:29:37,179
Stabilize the operating systems.

436
00:29:37,555 --> 00:29:38,055
Fire control.

437
00:29:39,556 --> 00:29:41,098
Attempting
containment protocols.

438
00:29:42,558 --> 00:29:44,102
I want to go home now.

439
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:47,105
Navigation's down.
System shorts everywhere.

440
00:29:47,521 --> 00:29:50,148
Damn.
Communications are out.

441
00:29:50,525 --> 00:29:52,109
Link up the secondary system.

442
00:29:52,527 --> 00:29:55,153
-Shunting power from reserve.
-Come on.

443
00:29:55,528 --> 00:29:56,072
Try it now.

444
00:29:56,529 --> 00:29:57,072
Navigational boards are lit.

445
00:29:58,531 --> 00:30:00,116
Can we reroute?

446
00:30:00,534 --> 00:30:02,118
I'm locked out of the helm.

447
00:30:02,536 --> 00:30:04,121
Nothing in computer control.

448
00:30:04,538 --> 00:30:06,122
Main com to manual.

449
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:08,124
See if she'll respond.

450
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:11,126
The main subroutine won't open.
I'm gonna try remote ops.

451
00:30:14,547 --> 00:30:15,047
Smith!

452
00:30:15,548 --> 00:30:18,133
Get back!
Get away from me!

453
00:30:18,549 --> 00:30:21,135
What the hell
are you doing here?

454
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:24,138
Major West,
thank God it's you.

455
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:27,142
I was in here
to do some last minute checks...

456
00:30:27,558 --> 00:30:28,058
and somebody hit me from behind.

457
00:30:28,518 --> 00:30:30,103
That's Sedition technology.

458
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,063
You're the damn spy.

459
00:30:32,521 --> 00:30:33,064
You did this.

460
00:30:36,525 --> 00:30:37,067
What are you doing?

461
00:30:37,526 --> 00:30:38,067
Throwing out the trash!

462
00:30:38,527 --> 00:30:40,069
I need help!

463
00:30:41,529 --> 00:30:43,073
I can't get Judy out!
She's dying!

464
00:30:48,536 --> 00:30:50,078
Touch me,
and the girl dies!

465
00:30:50,538 --> 00:30:52,080
I don't deal with dead men.

466
00:30:52,539 --> 00:30:54,083
Kill me, kill the girl.

467
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,086
How much is your revenge worth?

468
00:30:57,502 --> 00:30:59,087
I can save her life...

469
00:30:59,505 --> 00:31:03,174
only if you give me your word
as an officer you'll spare mine.

470
00:31:05,509 --> 00:31:09,180
-Help her.
-I've got helm control.

471
00:31:18,521 --> 00:31:20,106
We're way off course.

472
00:31:24,528 --> 00:31:26,070
We're caught in the sun's
gravitational pull.

473
00:31:26,528 --> 00:31:28,073
Is that what that big ball is?

474
00:31:32,535 --> 00:31:35,121
We've got four minutes before
the outer hull begins to melt.

475
00:31:35,538 --> 00:31:38,123
I need you to check
on the thruster alignments.

476
00:31:38,499 --> 00:31:40,084
Professor!

477
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,085
I'll try for the Mercury mines.

478
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:46,088
I'll need Dr. Robinson's
portable gurney.

479
00:31:46,506 --> 00:31:47,048
You'll find it below.

480
00:31:47,507 --> 00:31:49,049
Smith, come on!

481
00:31:52,511 --> 00:31:55,138
You tried to kill my family.

482
00:31:55,513 --> 00:31:56,015
We trusted you.

483
00:31:56,515 --> 00:31:58,057
It's the world behind the world,
Professor Robinson.

484
00:31:58,517 --> 00:32:02,144
Lie once, cheat twice,
and everything becomes clear.

485
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:07,192
Do not mistake my deception
for a character flaw.

486
00:32:07,483 --> 00:32:08,026
It is a philosophical choice...

487
00:32:08,484 --> 00:32:11,112
that I've found
in a study of the universe.

488
00:32:11,487 --> 00:32:13,071
It is a way of life.

489
00:32:13,489 --> 00:32:14,030
You're a monster.

490
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:17,116
Perhaps,
but I'm also the only one...

491
00:32:17,492 --> 00:32:19,077
that can save Judy's life.

492
00:32:21,497 --> 00:32:23,080
Penny, precious, I want you to
short the power on my command.

493
00:32:24,499 --> 00:32:25,000
Does he have to call me
precious?

494
00:32:28,502 --> 00:32:29,002
Penny, precious.

495
00:32:30,505 --> 00:32:32,048
Now!

496
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:39,054
She's not breathing.

497
00:32:39,512 --> 00:32:41,056
Sick bay, move!

498
00:32:41,515 --> 00:32:43,057
The sun won't let us go.

499
00:32:43,517 --> 00:32:45,059
Heat shield breach,
60 seconds.

500
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:46,019
I need options, Professor.

501
00:32:46,478 --> 00:32:48,063
We have to divert all power
to the engines.

502
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,065
I'm rerouting life sciences.

503
00:32:51,481 --> 00:32:53,067
Rerouting life support.

504
00:32:53,483 --> 00:32:55,068
Engines at 80%%%.

505
00:32:57,488 --> 00:33:00,115
There's no cardiopulmonary
or respiratory functions.

506
00:33:09,499 --> 00:33:09,999
Clear.

507
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:14,045
Again. Clear.

508
00:33:21,468 --> 00:33:22,009
Alert.

509
00:33:22,469 --> 00:33:23,010
Medical.

510
00:33:25,471 --> 00:33:26,013
Rerouting error.

511
00:33:26,472 --> 00:33:27,015
Systems are crashing.

512
00:33:31,477 --> 00:33:33,061
We're losing her. Do something.

513
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:44,990
Come on, child.

514
00:33:47,491 --> 00:33:49,035
Put a little heart into it.

515
00:33:51,496 --> 00:33:51,996
The other life I save...

516
00:33:53,498 --> 00:33:55,040
will be my own.

517
00:33:56,459 --> 00:34:00,128
Wake up, baby, please.

518
00:34:02,463 --> 00:34:04,048
That's all the power we've got.

519
00:34:04,465 --> 00:34:06,009
I'm putting the pedal
to the metal. Here goes.

520
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:25,068
She can't break free.
She doesn't have enough thrust.

521
00:34:25,443 --> 00:34:28,070
There's got to be a way
to get through this.

522
00:34:29,447 --> 00:34:29,989
That's it.

523
00:34:35,452 --> 00:34:35,994
It's working!

524
00:34:36,454 --> 00:34:38,038
What is?

525
00:34:38,454 --> 00:34:41,041
If we can't go around the sun,
we go straight through it...

526
00:34:41,458 --> 00:34:41,958
using your hyperdrive.

527
00:34:42,458 --> 00:34:44,043
Engage the hyperdrive
without a gate?

528
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:47,047
We could be thrown
anywhere in the galaxy.

529
00:34:47,463 --> 00:34:47,963
Anywhere but here.

530
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:56,012
On my mark.

531
00:35:01,476 --> 00:35:04,061
Three, two, one, initiate.

532
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,003
Hyperdrive at 100%%%.

533
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:35,090
Major, you have the com.

534
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:36,967
Dad?

535
00:35:37,425 --> 00:35:37,967
Dad!

536
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:42,014
Let's see what this baby can do.

537
00:36:18,422 --> 00:36:20,007
Maureen, everyone?

538
00:36:23,427 --> 00:36:23,969
-Where is Judy?
-She's OK.

539
00:36:24,427 --> 00:36:27,054
She is, thanks to me.

540
00:36:28,431 --> 00:36:28,972
Here I am.

541
00:36:30,432 --> 00:36:31,976
Either I should cut down
on the liquids...

542
00:36:32,434 --> 00:36:35,021
or I should sew in a new flap
because it was really hell...

543
00:36:35,438 --> 00:36:35,938
getting out of that thing.

544
00:36:36,438 --> 00:36:37,981
You're...

545
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,983
Vitals are normal. Pulse
and respiration seem to be.

546
00:36:40,442 --> 00:36:41,985
-Are you OK?
-I'm fine, really.

547
00:36:42,402 --> 00:36:42,943
Come here.

548
00:36:45,405 --> 00:36:48,032
Will every little problem be an
excuse for familial sentiment?

549
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:53,954
How much, Smith?

550
00:36:55,414 --> 00:36:59,083
What was the price tag
that you put on our future?

551
00:37:15,474 --> 00:37:18,059
You can't do it, can you, John?

552
00:37:18,476 --> 00:37:22,105
You can't kill the man
without becoming the monster.

553
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:33,074
Coward.

554
00:37:41,539 --> 00:37:43,083
What's happened, John?
Where are we?

555
00:37:50,505 --> 00:37:53,134
I bypassed
most of the damaged systems.

556
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:55,094
We'll have to repair the rest
manually.

557
00:37:57,512 --> 00:37:58,054
You had me worried, doc.

558
00:37:58,514 --> 00:38:00,099
Nice to see you thawed.

559
00:38:00,516 --> 00:38:03,143
You have a puzzling definition
of a smooth ride.

560
00:38:03,518 --> 00:38:08,231
Computer,
map our current position.

561
00:38:09,523 --> 00:38:13,193
Searching
for recognizable constellations.

562
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:20,159
This database has star maps
of all the known galaxy.

563
00:38:20,534 --> 00:38:23,119
I don't recognize
a single system.

564
00:38:25,539 --> 00:38:27,081
We're lost....

565
00:38:28,541 --> 00:38:29,041
aren't we?

566
00:38:46,516 --> 00:38:47,057
Easy, doc. God.

567
00:38:47,516 --> 00:38:48,016
Please.

568
00:38:48,518 --> 00:38:51,103
The cryosuit absorbed
most of the electrical charge.

569
00:38:52,521 --> 00:38:54,065
You're lucky
this wasn't your hide.

570
00:38:54,523 --> 00:38:58,152
Doctor, is that concern
I detect in your voice?

571
00:39:00,528 --> 00:39:02,072
Great bedside manner.

572
00:39:05,492 --> 00:39:07,077
What's that?

573
00:39:07,494 --> 00:39:09,077
A battle scar?

574
00:39:10,496 --> 00:39:11,039
Sort of.

575
00:39:12,498 --> 00:39:14,083
It was a tattoo.

576
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:18,170
An ex-girlfriend's name,
but I had it removed.

577
00:39:18,503 --> 00:39:20,088
Wouldn't it be easier
to use a magic marker?

578
00:39:22,507 --> 00:39:24,050
Yeah, well, that's me.

579
00:39:24,509 --> 00:39:27,094
A girl in every port.

580
00:39:27,512 --> 00:39:28,012
So, Major, no family?

581
00:39:29,514 --> 00:39:31,056
Nothing to tie you down,
no one to miss?

582
00:39:32,516 --> 00:39:35,101
I've never been
the fit-in and play-nice type.

583
00:39:37,521 --> 00:39:39,063
You think that's romantic?

584
00:39:42,483 --> 00:39:43,025
I don't.

585
00:39:44,485 --> 00:39:47,112
But what about you, doc?

586
00:39:47,489 --> 00:39:49,072
Is there some lucky little nerd
you left behind?

587
00:39:51,492 --> 00:39:53,034
I spent three years working
on this mission.

588
00:39:53,494 --> 00:39:55,036
We're trying to save the planet.

589
00:39:55,496 --> 00:39:57,081
I haven't had time for fun.

590
00:39:57,498 --> 00:40:01,126
If there's no time for fun...

591
00:40:01,501 --> 00:40:03,045
then what are we saving
the planet for?

592
00:40:15,472 --> 00:40:16,014
Here.

593
00:40:16,474 --> 00:40:17,016
Thanks.

594
00:40:17,474 --> 00:40:19,059
I hate being little.

595
00:40:25,481 --> 00:40:27,067
I think it broke.

596
00:40:30,485 --> 00:40:30,987
I'll try and fix it.

597
00:40:31,487 --> 00:40:34,072
Why aren't you up on deck
with Mom and Dad?

598
00:40:34,489 --> 00:40:34,990
Have you met our parents?

599
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:37,034
Good point.

600
00:40:39,494 --> 00:40:39,994
Popcorn, orchids...

601
00:40:40,496 --> 00:40:43,081
waves, Billy...

602
00:40:43,498 --> 00:40:45,041
kissing.

603
00:40:47,501 --> 00:40:48,001
Chocolate.

604
00:40:49,461 --> 00:40:51,047
It's a list...

605
00:40:53,465 --> 00:40:55,050
of everything we left behind.

606
00:41:00,472 --> 00:41:01,014
Never love anything, kiddo...

607
00:41:02,474 --> 00:41:05,101
'cause you just end up
losing it.

608
00:41:15,443 --> 00:41:17,028
Smith could still hurt us.

609
00:41:19,447 --> 00:41:21,032
Maybe I shouldn't let him live.

610
00:41:28,456 --> 00:41:28,998
But...

611
00:41:29,456 --> 00:41:31,041
How can we bring
civilization to the stars...

612
00:41:31,458 --> 00:41:34,085
if we can't remain civilized?
Right, Professor?

613
00:41:34,461 --> 00:41:37,047
Have you noticed that you
take the opposite position...

614
00:41:37,463 --> 00:41:39,007
to whatever I say?

615
00:41:39,465 --> 00:41:41,050
Of course I do.

616
00:41:41,467 --> 00:41:43,010
We're married.

617
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:45,972
Alert.

618
00:41:46,472 --> 00:41:49,057
Spatial anomaly in progress.

619
00:41:49,434 --> 00:41:51,018
What the hell?

620
00:41:59,443 --> 00:42:02,070
I must be dreaming.
That looks like a ship.

621
00:42:02,445 --> 00:42:06,115
It appears to be some sort
of hole in space.

622
00:42:06,449 --> 00:42:07,992
Where does it lead?

623
00:42:08,451 --> 00:42:10,036
A reasonable question.

624
00:42:14,456 --> 00:42:16,000
Major, wait.

625
00:42:16,458 --> 00:42:16,958
I'll wait later.

626
00:42:24,423 --> 00:42:24,965
Pull back.

627
00:42:25,425 --> 00:42:27,010
Let there be light.

628
00:42:56,454 --> 00:42:56,954
Proteus?

629
00:42:59,456 --> 00:43:00,998
She's one of ours, all right.

630
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:04,960
All right.

631
00:43:07,422 --> 00:43:09,007
I've never seen a ship
like this.

632
00:43:12,427 --> 00:43:15,054
No response to hails.

633
00:43:15,429 --> 00:43:19,099
Scanning all military
and civilian frequencies.

634
00:43:19,432 --> 00:43:19,974
Nothing.

635
00:43:20,434 --> 00:43:23,019
I'm getting
inconsistent life signs...

636
00:43:23,436 --> 00:43:26,063
but they may be sensor ghosts.

637
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:28,942
Computer is still on.

638
00:43:31,443 --> 00:43:34,030
I'll try the standard
docking codes.

639
00:43:34,405 --> 00:43:35,989
Control codes confirmed.

640
00:43:36,407 --> 00:43:36,949
Initiating docking sequence.

641
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:45,039
Weird.
What kind of ship is that?

642
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:47,000
That's not one of ours.

643
00:43:59,427 --> 00:44:02,014
Boys, that's not even human.

644
00:44:04,432 --> 00:44:04,932
If this is all a dream...

645
00:44:05,432 --> 00:44:08,018
why can't there be more girls?

646
00:44:14,442 --> 00:44:15,985
As part of her enslavement...

647
00:44:16,402 --> 00:44:20,072
the brave young space captive
Penny Robinson...

648
00:44:20,405 --> 00:44:26,161
is forced to utilize her
dazzling technical expertise.

649
00:44:35,418 --> 00:44:35,920
Identify yourself, soldier.

650
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:40,047
West, Major,
United Global Space Force...

651
00:44:40,423 --> 00:44:43,010
requesting permission
to see the prisoner.

652
00:44:47,389 --> 00:44:51,059
Proceed, Major West.

653
00:45:02,402 --> 00:45:03,987
Could he be cuter?

654
00:45:06,405 --> 00:45:07,990
I don't think so.

655
00:45:08,407 --> 00:45:09,951
Breathe, Penny.

656
00:45:14,413 --> 00:45:14,914
Unlock.

657
00:45:25,382 --> 00:45:26,965
These quarters are unacceptable.

658
00:45:27,384 --> 00:45:30,052
We're going to check out
the probe ship.

659
00:45:30,385 --> 00:45:33,054
Maybe we can figure out how they
got here and how to get home.

660
00:45:33,431 --> 00:45:33,931
Have a wonderful trip.

661
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:37,976
Put this on.

662
00:45:42,438 --> 00:45:44,023
You're coming with us.

663
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:48,068
Out of the question. I am
a doctor, not a space explorer.

664
00:45:48,485 --> 00:45:50,028
What you are
is a murderous saboteur.

665
00:45:50,445 --> 00:45:52,072
I am not leaving you here...

666
00:45:52,447 --> 00:45:54,074
so you can do more harm
than you've already caused.

667
00:45:54,492 --> 00:45:56,077
I absolutely refuse.

668
00:45:58,494 --> 00:46:00,079
Give me an excuse to kill you.

669
00:46:01,498 --> 00:46:03,083
Please?

670
00:46:10,505 --> 00:46:13,092
Black was always my color.

671
00:46:17,512 --> 00:46:18,012
Lock.

672
00:46:30,525 --> 00:46:32,068
Activate standby.

673
00:46:33,527 --> 00:46:35,070
Crush, kill, destroy.

674
00:46:38,489 --> 00:46:40,074
Surprise.

675
00:46:40,492 --> 00:46:41,034
Safety on.

676
00:46:43,494 --> 00:46:45,038
Dad, chill.
It's OK.

677
00:46:45,496 --> 00:46:47,039
I hacked into his CPU,
and then...

678
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:51,126
I bypassed
his main operating systems...

679
00:46:51,501 --> 00:46:54,088
and accessed his subroutines.

680
00:46:54,505 --> 00:46:57,090
He's basically just running
on remote control.

681
00:46:59,467 --> 00:47:01,052
I know I haven't been around--

682
00:47:01,469 --> 00:47:03,054
Professor.

683
00:47:04,472 --> 00:47:06,056
We're ready to go.

684
00:47:08,476 --> 00:47:10,061
We'll talk later, son.

685
00:47:14,481 --> 00:47:16,067
Take care of my dad.

686
00:47:16,483 --> 00:47:18,068
OK, Robot?

687
00:47:28,494 --> 00:47:30,038
Vacuum check complete.

688
00:47:53,476 --> 00:47:54,018
Oxygen levels are normal.

689
00:47:55,478 --> 00:47:56,019
Microbe scans are negative.

690
00:47:56,478 --> 00:47:58,021
Clear.

691
00:48:01,483 --> 00:48:04,068
The air is stale, old.

692
00:48:04,485 --> 00:48:06,028
That's the smell of ghosts.

693
00:48:09,449 --> 00:48:12,076
I've got
her on-board computer up.

694
00:48:13,452 --> 00:48:13,994
Not working?

695
00:48:14,452 --> 00:48:16,038
She's working, all right.

696
00:48:16,454 --> 00:48:16,996
Just--I don't know.

697
00:48:17,456 --> 00:48:20,083
Too damn fast.

698
00:49:02,456 --> 00:49:05,083
Dad, do you hear something?

699
00:49:05,458 --> 00:49:07,001
Like the drip, drip of blood.

700
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:10,088
You really need to shut up.

701
00:49:11,463 --> 00:49:13,007
Here.

702
00:49:24,434 --> 00:49:26,018
This matter appears biological.

703
00:49:27,436 --> 00:49:29,021
Nothing good will come of this.

704
00:49:29,438 --> 00:49:32,065
You, of course, being the expert
on space exploration.

705
00:49:34,443 --> 00:49:34,985
Let's go.

706
00:49:37,445 --> 00:49:39,030
Trust me, Major.

707
00:49:40,449 --> 00:49:43,034
Evil knows evil.

708
00:50:10,434 --> 00:50:11,978
Motion sensors
are still working.

709
00:50:12,436 --> 00:50:12,978
This way.

710
00:50:31,411 --> 00:50:34,039
Rambler-crane series robots.

711
00:50:34,414 --> 00:50:37,041
But like no design
I've ever seen.

712
00:50:37,418 --> 00:50:39,003
Well, well.

713
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:42,005
Aren't we the poor cousin?

714
00:50:42,422 --> 00:50:44,007
Down here.

715
00:50:52,431 --> 00:50:53,974
It's a remote op station.

716
00:50:55,434 --> 00:50:56,976
Come on, Dr. Smith.

717
00:51:00,438 --> 00:51:01,981
Could this ship be a prototype?

718
00:51:03,442 --> 00:51:04,985
Looks like some kind
of fire fight.

719
00:51:07,445 --> 00:51:08,987
Captain's log is degraded.

720
00:51:10,405 --> 00:51:14,076
Maybe I can gather
some fragments.

721
00:51:18,414 --> 00:51:19,956
Sorry.

722
00:51:22,416 --> 00:51:25,045
The hyperspace tracker seems
to be functioning normally...

723
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:28,047
but we cannot process
all the data.

724
00:51:30,425 --> 00:51:33,010
There is no sign
of the Jupiter 2.

725
00:51:33,427 --> 00:51:36,012
I have exceeded my timetable.

726
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:40,976
When did he make Major?

727
00:51:41,393 --> 00:51:42,978
I want this on the record.

728
00:51:43,394 --> 00:51:47,065
I am not willing to give up.

729
00:51:47,398 --> 00:51:48,983
Don would come looking for me.

730
00:51:56,407 --> 00:51:58,992
That's it. The rest
of the data's totally corrupted.

731
00:51:59,409 --> 00:52:01,994
How could they launch
a rescue mission for us...

732
00:52:02,411 --> 00:52:04,998
when we've only been lost a day?

733
00:52:05,414 --> 00:52:08,001
There's no data
on the alien ship...

734
00:52:08,418 --> 00:52:11,003
but they brought in something
that was attached to its hull.

735
00:52:13,422 --> 00:52:13,922
Got it.

736
00:52:19,385 --> 00:52:20,971
Some sort of egg sack?

737
00:52:33,398 --> 00:52:33,940
Get back here!

738
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:38,027
Be happy to oblige...

739
00:52:38,403 --> 00:52:39,947
although I don't think it's me
you should be worrying about...

740
00:52:40,405 --> 00:52:41,949
but rather these.

741
00:52:48,371 --> 00:52:49,956
I'm detecting motion.

742
00:52:50,373 --> 00:52:51,958
Behind you.

743
00:52:54,376 --> 00:52:54,918
After it. Move!

744
00:53:00,382 --> 00:53:00,923
Bring Smith.

745
00:53:01,382 --> 00:53:04,010
Don't even think about it.

746
00:53:24,403 --> 00:53:24,905
Hydroponics.

747
00:53:25,405 --> 00:53:27,990
Growth like this
would take decades.

748
00:53:30,367 --> 00:53:32,994
Unhand me, you mechanical moron.

749
00:53:36,373 --> 00:53:37,916
Don't move.

750
00:53:47,425 --> 00:53:48,927
Easy.

751
00:53:49,427 --> 00:53:50,969
Easy there, buddy.

752
00:53:51,429 --> 00:53:52,972
No one's gonna hurt you.

753
00:53:55,391 --> 00:53:56,976
Easy.

754
00:53:59,394 --> 00:54:00,978
Relax.

755
00:54:08,445 --> 00:54:09,027
Excellent.

756
00:54:09,445 --> 00:54:12,114
Looks like you made a friend.

757
00:54:12,447 --> 00:54:12,989
Still, I'd wait a few weeks...

758
00:54:13,449 --> 00:54:15,076
before tattooing
her name on your arm.

759
00:54:18,494 --> 00:54:18,996
Do yourself a favor.

760
00:54:19,496 --> 00:54:21,039
Don't evolve.

761
00:54:22,498 --> 00:54:24,041
Charming.

762
00:54:24,501 --> 00:54:26,043
The Dr. Dolittle of outer space.

763
00:54:26,503 --> 00:54:30,130
This could be a creature
from that alien ship.

764
00:54:30,505 --> 00:54:32,048
But this guy's no pilot.

765
00:54:32,507 --> 00:54:34,050
He looks like a child.

766
00:54:50,483 --> 00:54:52,025
Try it now.

767
00:54:57,489 --> 00:54:59,032
Strange.

768
00:54:59,490 --> 00:55:02,077
The scales are giving off heat.

769
00:55:02,452 --> 00:55:04,036
I've tapped into
the internal sensor array.

770
00:55:06,456 --> 00:55:09,083
There's no other
animate life present.

771
00:55:09,458 --> 00:55:12,085
Besides us,
this ship is totally deserted.

772
00:55:12,461 --> 00:55:15,088
A ghost ship.

773
00:55:15,463 --> 00:55:19,134
The flavor of the day
is banana beef.

774
00:55:21,469 --> 00:55:23,054
Who thinks up
these combinations?

775
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:32,980
Good.

776
00:55:33,481 --> 00:55:36,065
Major West, I highly
recommend you never breed.

777
00:55:37,483 --> 00:55:40,070
That, by the way,
is my medical opinion.

778
00:56:01,465 --> 00:56:02,007
Little thing was hungry.

779
00:56:02,465 --> 00:56:04,009
I got their star maps on-line.

780
00:56:04,467 --> 00:56:06,010
Here we go.

781
00:56:06,469 --> 00:56:09,054
More systems
than I've ever seen.

782
00:56:09,472 --> 00:56:12,057
Finding a route to Alpha Prime.

783
00:56:12,432 --> 00:56:15,061
Downloading to Jupiter.

784
00:56:30,449 --> 00:56:32,034
I don't like the sound
of that sound.

785
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:41,960
They're moving.

786
00:56:52,469 --> 00:56:55,056
Get this infernal...

787
00:56:55,431 --> 00:56:57,016
ape thing off me!

788
00:56:57,432 --> 00:56:57,974
Come here.

789
00:56:58,434 --> 00:57:01,061
John, get the hell out of there.

790
00:57:01,436 --> 00:57:04,063
Mom says,
"Get the hell out of there."

791
00:57:33,423 --> 00:57:33,965
Evacuate.

792
00:57:34,425 --> 00:57:36,010
Now!

793
00:57:47,436 --> 00:57:48,980
The controls are too slow.

794
00:57:49,438 --> 00:57:50,981
Activate holographic interface.

795
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:54,025
Holographic interface, on-line.

796
00:58:17,422 --> 00:58:18,965
They eat their wounded.

797
00:58:30,393 --> 00:58:30,934
Seal the bulkhead.

798
00:58:33,396 --> 00:58:33,938
Codes are locked.

799
00:58:40,402 --> 00:58:40,943
Duck.

800
00:58:44,405 --> 00:58:47,032
Closing bulkhead.

801
00:58:56,416 --> 00:58:57,960
Fire sensor activated.

802
00:58:58,418 --> 00:58:59,961
Emergency bulkhead closing.

803
00:59:02,422 --> 00:59:03,965
Stop!

804
00:59:04,423 --> 00:59:05,967
We have to get that door open.

805
00:59:12,389 --> 00:59:13,974
Open, damn you!

806
00:59:14,391 --> 00:59:15,976
Get out of here.

807
00:59:16,393 --> 00:59:20,063
What is with me
and these damn doors?

808
00:59:20,396 --> 00:59:23,025
I can't override
the fire protocol!

809
00:59:25,402 --> 00:59:26,945
A million bucks
worth of weaponry...

810
00:59:28,403 --> 00:59:29,947
and I'd trade it all back...

811
00:59:31,407 --> 00:59:32,949
for a lousy...

812
00:59:34,409 --> 00:59:34,909
can of Raid.

813
00:59:51,384 --> 00:59:52,969
Stand clear.

814
01:00:07,398 --> 01:00:08,942
Get moving! Go!

815
01:00:16,407 --> 01:00:16,907
Come on!

816
01:00:17,407 --> 01:00:19,992
Maureen...
can you get me anything?

817
01:00:20,409 --> 01:00:21,954
Cycling through a vacuum check.
I'm overriding.

818
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:33,922
No way it's that easy.

819
01:01:05,367 --> 01:01:05,869
Run!

820
01:01:08,371 --> 01:01:10,956
Run! Get back!
Get back to the ship!

821
01:01:11,373 --> 01:01:12,958
Move it!

822
01:01:26,387 --> 01:01:26,887
Got it. Try it now.

823
01:01:27,389 --> 01:01:29,974
Mom says, "Try it now."

824
01:01:44,362 --> 01:01:44,905
Can we save it?

825
01:01:45,362 --> 01:01:48,992
Can't without letting
the spiders into the ship.

826
01:01:49,367 --> 01:01:49,867
Leave him behind!

827
01:01:58,333 --> 01:02:02,003
That spider scratched me!

828
01:02:03,338 --> 01:02:04,922
Stop laughing, you little worm.

829
01:02:17,393 --> 01:02:17,893
Good-bye, Robot.

830
01:02:20,394 --> 01:02:20,896
You couldn't save him, kid.

831
01:02:21,396 --> 01:02:22,981
Save him? Of course.

832
01:02:29,445 --> 01:02:29,903
What are you trying to do?

833
01:02:34,492 --> 01:02:34,992
Hurry! Disengage!

834
01:02:45,460 --> 01:02:47,045
This is a fun picnic.

835
01:02:47,461 --> 01:02:50,088
First yellow aliens,
now giant spiders.

836
01:03:00,474 --> 01:03:02,016
The crowd goes wild.

837
01:03:02,476 --> 01:03:04,018
Recall your childhood
nightmares, Major.

838
01:03:04,478 --> 01:03:06,021
Monsters are rarely
so easily dissuaded.

839
01:03:06,438 --> 01:03:09,065
Why don't you talk to them,
bug to bug?

840
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:11,025
I think
they'd rather come inside.

841
01:03:20,449 --> 01:03:22,034
Arming torpedoes.

842
01:03:24,454 --> 01:03:24,954
Fire in the hole.

843
01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:34,045
Alert. Detonation failure.

844
01:03:36,465 --> 01:03:39,050
The robot must have damaged
the detonator cores.

845
01:03:39,467 --> 01:03:41,010
They won't blow.

846
01:03:41,469 --> 01:03:45,097
Alert.
Outer hub has been compromised.

847
01:03:46,474 --> 01:03:48,016
DNA extrapolation coming up.

848
01:03:48,434 --> 01:03:52,105
Silicone-based, mantium shell,
lack of respiratory system.

849
01:03:52,438 --> 01:03:54,023
Means they do live
in deep space.

850
01:03:56,442 --> 01:03:59,068
Tiny front brain implies
communal relationships.

851
01:03:59,445 --> 01:03:59,987
Like beetles.

852
01:04:00,445 --> 01:04:03,072
The biology lesson is over.
I could use some help.

853
01:04:03,447 --> 01:04:06,076
They may be attracted
to heat and light.

854
01:04:08,452 --> 01:04:11,039
Inner hull breach in 15 seconds.

855
01:04:11,456 --> 01:04:14,041
I'm bringing the Proteus
fusion drives on-line.

856
01:04:27,429 --> 01:04:27,971
It's working.

857
01:04:28,429 --> 01:04:30,014
Let's turn up the heat.

858
01:04:30,431 --> 01:04:30,972
What are you doing?

859
01:04:31,431 --> 01:04:33,016
Never leave an enemy stronghold
intact.

860
01:04:33,434 --> 01:04:33,934
Stop!

861
01:04:34,434 --> 01:04:36,019
That's one of your father's
first rules of the game.

862
01:04:37,438 --> 01:04:37,938
That is a direct order.

863
01:04:38,438 --> 01:04:38,938
I hate spiders.

864
01:05:06,422 --> 01:05:07,965
That's coming fast.

865
01:05:08,423 --> 01:05:09,967
Get into the harnesses now.

866
01:05:10,425 --> 01:05:11,969
Manual helm, engage.

867
01:05:14,429 --> 01:05:15,972
-Children, secure?
-Secure.

868
01:05:16,431 --> 01:05:16,931
I'm in.

869
01:05:37,409 --> 01:05:38,994
Pull up.

870
01:05:39,411 --> 01:05:39,952
Really? No kidding.
Thanks.

871
01:05:45,416 --> 01:05:47,001
Coming in too hot.
I'll try and slow us down.

872
01:06:18,405 --> 01:06:18,947
Hang on!

873
01:06:42,385 --> 01:06:42,927
Everybody by the numbers.

874
01:06:43,387 --> 01:06:44,971
Life sciences,
still breathing.

875
01:06:47,389 --> 01:06:50,018
Video mechanics...
OK.

876
01:06:50,393 --> 01:06:51,978
Mission medical, I'm alive.

877
01:06:52,394 --> 01:06:53,980
Me, too.
Robotics, I mean.

878
01:06:54,396 --> 01:06:55,981
I'm alive...

879
01:06:56,398 --> 01:06:58,983
Major West's poor excuse for
piloting skills notwithstanding.

880
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:03,030
Oh, Dorothy.

881
01:07:03,405 --> 01:07:03,905
Back in Kansas at last.

882
01:07:34,391 --> 01:07:35,934
You violated a direct order.

883
01:07:37,393 --> 01:07:39,980
About half the core
material's burned out.

884
01:07:40,396 --> 01:07:41,940
We'll never generate
enough power to break orbit.

885
01:07:42,356 --> 01:07:42,898
We can get off the ground...

886
01:07:43,358 --> 01:07:44,943
but getting back into space
is another story.

887
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:50,030
I ordered you not to blow
that ship's reactors.

888
01:07:50,364 --> 01:07:52,992
Life support is marginal.

889
01:07:53,367 --> 01:07:53,909
It's gonna get cold in here
tonight.

890
01:07:54,367 --> 01:07:59,081
Also, the pod and the chariot
are pretty much scrap metal.

891
01:07:59,373 --> 01:08:00,958
Don't you walk away from me
when I'm talking to you.

892
01:08:01,375 --> 01:08:02,958
Give it a rest, Professor.

893
01:08:03,376 --> 01:08:03,876
I was technically
still in command.

894
01:08:04,376 --> 01:08:06,963
I am commander of this mission.

895
01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:08,922
Look, no offense...

896
01:08:09,382 --> 01:08:10,925
but you're an egghead
with an honorary rank.

897
01:08:11,384 --> 01:08:13,969
No one ever intended for you
to handle combat situations.

898
01:08:14,387 --> 01:08:18,015
You handled it brilliantly,
sending us crashing down here.

899
01:08:18,390 --> 01:08:20,975
Those aliens posed
a continuing threat.

900
01:08:21,393 --> 01:08:22,935
I made a judgment call...

901
01:08:23,395 --> 01:08:25,980
and, if I have to,
I'll make it again.

902
01:08:26,355 --> 01:08:27,940
You of all people
should understand that.

903
01:08:28,358 --> 01:08:28,899
Your father would back me up.

904
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:29,900
My father is dead...

905
01:08:30,359 --> 01:08:35,072
killed in one of those combat
missions you admire so much.

906
01:08:35,363 --> 01:08:36,907
My family is on this ship,
and you will follow my orders...

907
01:08:37,365 --> 01:08:39,993
whether you agree with them
or not. Is that clear?

908
01:08:40,368 --> 01:08:40,911
Save your speeches.

909
01:08:41,369 --> 01:08:42,912
I like you, but I'm gonna
do whatever it takes...

910
01:08:43,371 --> 01:08:44,914
to ensure the success
of this mission...

911
01:08:45,372 --> 01:08:47,958
with or without your help.
Is that clear?

912
01:08:48,376 --> 01:08:49,918
Am I interrupting something?

913
01:08:50,336 --> 01:08:51,921
No, really.

914
01:08:52,337 --> 01:08:53,922
I think you two
should slug it out.

915
01:08:57,342 --> 01:08:58,926
Here we are,
stranded on an alien world...

916
01:08:59,344 --> 01:09:01,971
and you want
to get into a pissing contest?

917
01:09:02,346 --> 01:09:03,931
Please, go for it.

918
01:09:04,349 --> 01:09:06,975
I'll have Judy down here
to declare you both unfit...

919
01:09:07,351 --> 01:09:07,851
and I'll take over this mission.

920
01:09:09,354 --> 01:09:11,939
I don't want to hear another
word from you. Is that clear?

921
01:09:13,356 --> 01:09:15,943
Not...another word.

922
01:09:16,359 --> 01:09:16,860
Better.

923
01:09:18,362 --> 01:09:20,948
If you've finished hosing down
the decks with testosterone...

924
01:09:21,364 --> 01:09:22,908
I suggest you come with me.

925
01:09:23,365 --> 01:09:24,909
I may have found a way
off this planet.

926
01:09:30,372 --> 01:09:31,916
Tell me about it.

927
01:10:11,327 --> 01:10:12,912
Damn bug bite.

928
01:10:30,345 --> 01:10:31,887
She...

929
01:10:32,387 --> 01:10:36,015
She really is an interesting
specimen. Huh, doc?

930
01:10:36,391 --> 01:10:37,935
She's fascinating.

931
01:10:39,395 --> 01:10:40,938
The retinal aperture dilation...

932
01:10:41,395 --> 01:10:44,024
seems directly linked
to the skin pigmentation.

933
01:10:47,359 --> 01:10:47,902
What?

934
01:10:50,404 --> 01:10:50,947
Can I keep her?

935
01:10:55,451 --> 01:10:58,078
She's not just another fad
you can pick up and throw away.

936
01:10:58,453 --> 01:11:01,081
Oh, please.

937
01:11:01,456 --> 01:11:04,042
She's all alone here, and
I promise I'll look out for her.

938
01:11:04,458 --> 01:11:06,002
I promise.

939
01:11:09,421 --> 01:11:11,006
She kind of needs me.

940
01:11:15,469 --> 01:11:18,055
The minute you misplace her,
you forget to feed her--

941
01:11:18,430 --> 01:11:20,015
Don't smile. I mean it, Pen.

942
01:11:21,432 --> 01:11:23,018
Thanks...doc.

943
01:11:26,438 --> 01:11:30,065
We're both a long way from home,
aren't we, little one?

944
01:11:34,444 --> 01:11:34,944
Blarp?

945
01:11:41,451 --> 01:11:42,993
That's what we'll call you--
Blarp.

946
01:11:49,417 --> 01:11:51,002
Nice girl.

947
01:11:51,418 --> 01:11:53,003
Pretty girl.

948
01:12:01,427 --> 01:12:01,929
Nice.

949
01:12:06,432 --> 01:12:10,060
The atmosphere here
can sustain human life.

950
01:12:10,435 --> 01:12:13,021
I've located 500 rads
of radioactive material...

951
01:12:13,439 --> 01:12:14,981
five miles west.

952
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:18,027
We'll need at least that much to
get the core functioning again.

953
01:12:19,403 --> 01:12:20,988
We start out at daybreak.

954
01:12:24,407 --> 01:12:25,992
Be safer that way.

955
01:12:29,412 --> 01:12:30,997
Those are my orders.

956
01:12:39,421 --> 01:12:40,963
I agree
with your recommendation.

957
01:12:43,425 --> 01:12:43,925
Détente's a beautiful thing.

958
01:12:52,432 --> 01:12:55,019
It's nice to see you found
a corner to suit your talents.

959
01:12:55,435 --> 01:12:56,979
Turn down the bed
before you leave.

960
01:12:57,438 --> 01:12:58,980
I gave my word I'd let you live.

961
01:13:01,399 --> 01:13:01,942
I never said for how long.

962
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:05,028
Family hour is over.

963
01:13:05,403 --> 01:13:06,988
We're dying here.

964
01:13:07,404 --> 01:13:11,074
Robinson is out of his league.

965
01:13:11,408 --> 01:13:15,037
Look into his eyes and tell me
you can't see his fear.

966
01:13:18,414 --> 01:13:21,001
I fought in the millennial wars.

967
01:13:21,417 --> 01:13:21,917
Survival is a soldier's game.

968
01:13:22,418 --> 01:13:26,046
We both know this civilian fool
will lead us straight to hell.

969
01:13:26,381 --> 01:13:32,136
Robinson needs our help,
if he wants it or not.

970
01:13:32,386 --> 01:13:33,970
With minimal force,
we could take this ship...

971
01:13:34,387 --> 01:13:37,015
and assure them we shall
continue at your command.

972
01:13:38,391 --> 01:13:39,976
Of course.

973
01:13:40,394 --> 01:13:41,979
My God...

974
01:13:42,395 --> 01:13:43,979
you're right.

975
01:13:44,396 --> 01:13:46,983
How could I have been so blind?

976
01:13:47,399 --> 01:13:53,154
I'll just run and get you a gun
so we can hijack the ship, OK?

977
01:13:55,408 --> 01:13:56,951
Sarcasm is the recourse
of the weak mind.

978
01:13:59,411 --> 01:14:00,953
I'm hiding the pain.

979
01:14:01,412 --> 01:14:01,912
Really.

980
01:14:06,417 --> 01:14:06,917
Lock.

981
01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:15,051
Your pain...

982
01:14:15,384 --> 01:14:15,926
has just begun.

983
01:14:21,390 --> 01:14:22,932
Starlight, star bright.

984
01:14:27,395 --> 01:14:29,980
A million strange stars,
and only one wish.

985
01:14:30,398 --> 01:14:31,940
I wish we were home.

986
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:36,945
Never seen a sky look so alien.

987
01:14:37,363 --> 01:14:39,989
We really are lost,
aren't we?

988
01:14:46,371 --> 01:14:48,997
When the first sailors
circled the globe...

989
01:14:49,373 --> 01:14:52,001
saw a brand-new sky...

990
01:14:52,376 --> 01:14:56,005
they thought they'd sailed
off the edge of the earth...

991
01:14:56,380 --> 01:14:56,881
but they were really
just around the corner.

992
01:15:00,384 --> 01:15:01,969
You're saying we should
just billow our sails...

993
01:15:02,386 --> 01:15:03,929
and let the wind take us home?

994
01:15:04,386 --> 01:15:04,887
Is that it?

995
01:15:07,390 --> 01:15:08,932
Those sailors...

996
01:15:10,393 --> 01:15:14,020
found familiar shapes...

997
01:15:14,396 --> 01:15:16,981
in the stars...

998
01:15:17,358 --> 01:15:19,984
to make the sky seem
more friendly...

999
01:15:20,359 --> 01:15:20,903
and to help them
find their way home.

1000
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:23,988
That's how the constellations
were born.

1001
01:15:26,365 --> 01:15:28,993
Porky, the wise and mighty pig.

1002
01:15:46,342 --> 01:15:51,055
The great...
big-eared bunny Bugs.

1003
01:16:01,355 --> 01:16:03,942
The way you got us down here,
that was pretty flying.

1004
01:16:12,365 --> 01:16:13,908
My quarters or yours?

1005
01:16:14,368 --> 01:16:15,911
Excuse me?

1006
01:16:16,369 --> 01:16:17,912
Don't play coy.

1007
01:16:18,372 --> 01:16:22,000
We're the only single people
of consenting age in the galaxy.

1008
01:16:22,376 --> 01:16:23,918
How much more of a setup
do you need?

1009
01:16:26,378 --> 01:16:28,965
So you figure, why not dispense
with the pleasantries...

1010
01:16:29,340 --> 01:16:30,925
and get down to business?

1011
01:16:31,341 --> 01:16:33,970
You have a way with words.

1012
01:16:36,346 --> 01:16:37,890
Do you want to show me
how you handle the helm?

1013
01:16:43,353 --> 01:16:44,938
Right here on this console?

1014
01:16:49,359 --> 01:16:51,944
Right here would be fine.

1015
01:17:02,328 --> 01:17:04,956
Why don't you just hang on
to your joystick?

1016
01:17:14,340 --> 01:17:15,925
Excellent technique, Major.

1017
01:17:18,344 --> 01:17:18,844
Really.

1018
01:17:24,349 --> 01:17:24,850
Hi.

1019
01:17:25,350 --> 01:17:26,893
Will was looking for you.

1020
01:17:30,313 --> 01:17:31,898
I sent him back to his room.

1021
01:17:32,355 --> 01:17:34,942
He's decided
he can rebuild the robot.

1022
01:17:37,319 --> 01:17:39,947
He wants to stay up all night
and show me his designs.

1023
01:17:41,323 --> 01:17:42,908
Funny creatures, men.

1024
01:17:43,324 --> 01:17:46,994
Try so hard not to be
their fathers...

1025
01:17:47,328 --> 01:17:48,872
end up making the same mistakes.

1026
01:17:49,329 --> 01:17:54,042
We can't get off this planet,
let alone get back on course.

1027
01:17:54,335 --> 01:17:55,877
I don't have time.

1028
01:17:56,337 --> 01:17:57,880
Just listen to him.

1029
01:17:58,338 --> 01:18:00,923
It doesn't matter what he says.
Just listen.

1030
01:18:01,341 --> 01:18:04,970
Sometimes--especially
in the eyes of their fathers--

1031
01:18:05,302 --> 01:18:07,930
Iittle boys have to come first.

1032
01:18:08,347 --> 01:18:10,932
As soon as
we get back up into space...

1033
01:18:11,309 --> 01:18:13,935
we'll spend a lot of time
together, I promise.

1034
01:18:34,329 --> 01:18:36,916
It's nice having your
whole family under one roof.

1035
01:18:39,333 --> 01:18:41,920
Even if we did have to go...

1036
01:18:42,295 --> 01:18:44,922
halfway across the galaxy
to manage it.

1037
01:18:58,351 --> 01:18:58,894
Good night, John.

1038
01:18:59,353 --> 01:19:00,895
Good night, Maureen.

1039
01:19:01,354 --> 01:19:02,898
Good night, Judy.

1040
01:19:03,398 --> 01:19:03,856
Good night, Will.

1041
01:19:05,442 --> 01:19:06,984
Good night, Penny.

1042
01:19:09,444 --> 01:19:10,988
You guys have got to be kidding.

1043
01:19:18,412 --> 01:19:19,997
Good morning, Will Robinson.

1044
01:19:20,413 --> 01:19:23,041
Solar panels are charged.

1045
01:19:41,432 --> 01:19:42,975
The radioactive material
we need for the core...

1046
01:19:43,435 --> 01:19:44,978
is in the center of that bubble.

1047
01:19:45,436 --> 01:19:45,936
I was afraid of this.

1048
01:19:48,439 --> 01:19:51,024
OK, everybody,
let's get settled now.

1049
01:19:53,444 --> 01:19:56,029
I think this "bubble"
out there...

1050
01:19:56,404 --> 01:20:00,074
is exactly the same thing
we passed through in space.

1051
01:20:00,408 --> 01:20:04,078
Both of them are opening
and closing doorways.

1052
01:20:04,412 --> 01:20:05,956
Doorways to where?

1053
01:20:06,413 --> 01:20:10,042
Doorways in...time.

1054
01:20:10,417 --> 01:20:10,960
You can't be serious.

1055
01:20:11,418 --> 01:20:12,962
Time travel is impossible.

1056
01:20:13,421 --> 01:20:16,006
It's not.
Just improbable.

1057
01:20:16,422 --> 01:20:20,051
What if we crossed
into a time...

1058
01:20:20,385 --> 01:20:23,012
years after Earth
sent a rescue mission?

1059
01:20:23,387 --> 01:20:24,972
Perhaps the professor
hit his head when we landed.

1060
01:20:25,390 --> 01:20:25,931
Think about it.

1061
01:20:26,390 --> 01:20:29,018
The way the Proteus
seemed deserted for so long.

1062
01:20:30,395 --> 01:20:33,021
Your friend looking so old.

1063
01:20:33,396 --> 01:20:34,981
So if we walk
inside that bubble...

1064
01:20:35,399 --> 01:20:36,984
we could be walking
further into the future.

1065
01:20:38,402 --> 01:20:40,988
Dad, what if the doorways
aren't natural?

1066
01:20:41,404 --> 01:20:45,074
This kind of phenomenon could
only be produced naturally.

1067
01:20:45,408 --> 01:20:46,951
That bubble's
the kind of side effect...

1068
01:20:47,409 --> 01:20:49,996
I predicted my time machine
would do.

1069
01:20:50,412 --> 01:20:51,956
What if someone built a device--

1070
01:20:52,414 --> 01:20:55,000
Son...
I appreciate your input...

1071
01:20:55,417 --> 01:20:56,961
but now is not the time
for flights of fancy.

1072
01:20:57,377 --> 01:21:00,005
You never listen to me.

1073
01:21:01,422 --> 01:21:02,966
Not ever.

1074
01:21:12,390 --> 01:21:15,019
This time bubble could be
causing these earthquakes.

1075
01:21:16,395 --> 01:21:20,023
No telling how long before
this planet breaks up entirely.

1076
01:21:20,399 --> 01:21:21,942
The major and I
are going to locate...

1077
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:23,944
the radioactive material
for the core.

1078
01:21:25,403 --> 01:21:27,988
We may have very little time.

1079
01:21:39,373 --> 01:21:40,958
I'm leaving now.

1080
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:41,917
That's a surprise.

1081
01:21:48,382 --> 01:21:52,052
You're the most important thing
in the world to me.

1082
01:21:52,386 --> 01:21:54,971
One day, I hope you'll
be able to understand that.

1083
01:21:55,389 --> 01:22:00,060
What if...
one time you don't come home?

1084
01:22:04,396 --> 01:22:05,939
Whenever your grandfather
went on a mission...

1085
01:22:14,364 --> 01:22:18,034
he'd leave these with me
for safekeeping.

1086
01:22:19,368 --> 01:22:23,039
When he came home,
I would always be there...

1087
01:22:23,372 --> 01:22:26,001
waiting to give them back.

1088
01:22:28,377 --> 01:22:29,921
I'm coming back.

1089
01:22:32,381 --> 01:22:32,881
I promise.

1090
01:22:58,363 --> 01:22:58,863
Listen...

1091
01:23:01,365 --> 01:23:01,867
about last night...

1092
01:23:04,368 --> 01:23:05,912
Go on. You can do it.

1093
01:23:08,372 --> 01:23:08,872
I'm sorry.

1094
01:23:09,373 --> 01:23:11,958
See, that wasn't so difficult.

1095
01:23:12,376 --> 01:23:16,005
Like pulling steel needles
through my cheeks.

1096
01:23:16,380 --> 01:23:21,051
Then you understand
what saying this feels like.

1097
01:23:21,342 --> 01:23:22,927
Try to come back in one piece.

1098
01:23:28,349 --> 01:23:29,934
Listen, doc, I'm...

1099
01:23:32,353 --> 01:23:34,979
I'm thinking this is your basic
"kiss for luck" occasion.

1100
01:23:35,355 --> 01:23:35,855
Wouldn't you agree?

1101
01:23:36,356 --> 01:23:37,940
Thinking.

1102
01:23:38,359 --> 01:23:39,902
It's not really
your strong suit, is it?

1103
01:23:45,364 --> 01:23:47,951
I've got a fix
on the radioactive material.

1104
01:24:01,337 --> 01:24:02,922
That was scientific.

1105
01:24:05,341 --> 01:24:05,841
Scared?

1106
01:24:07,342 --> 01:24:08,927
There's an alloy
in this crater wall...

1107
01:24:09,345 --> 01:24:10,930
that's disabling the com-links.

1108
01:24:11,346 --> 01:24:12,890
You're not going to be able
to communicate with the ship.

1109
01:24:18,354 --> 01:24:19,896
Come home to me, professor.

1110
01:24:22,315 --> 01:24:23,899
I love you, wife.

1111
01:24:30,323 --> 01:24:30,864
Come here, squirt.

1112
01:24:44,336 --> 01:24:46,962
Nice girl.
Pretty girl. Nice.

1113
01:25:17,323 --> 01:25:19,909
It's OK.
You're still in one piece.

1114
01:25:25,332 --> 01:25:25,832
Come on.

1115
01:25:31,337 --> 01:25:33,922
Can you hear me, Robot?
Hello?

1116
01:25:35,298 --> 01:25:36,884
Systems error!

1117
01:25:37,342 --> 01:25:38,886
Robot unable to locate
motor controls!

1118
01:25:39,302 --> 01:25:39,845
Unable to--

1119
01:25:40,304 --> 01:25:40,845
Calm down.

1120
01:25:41,305 --> 01:25:43,931
What is happening to me?

1121
01:25:44,306 --> 01:25:47,976
I didn't have enough time
to finish the download.

1122
01:25:48,310 --> 01:25:49,854
Warning!
Penny, give it back!

1123
01:25:50,313 --> 01:25:52,939
My circuits are unbalanced.

1124
01:25:53,315 --> 01:25:54,859
So I had to finish you off
with another personality.

1125
01:25:55,317 --> 01:25:56,860
I put my mind inside of yours.

1126
01:26:03,324 --> 01:26:05,909
That explains
this warm fuzzy feeling...

1127
01:26:06,286 --> 01:26:07,871
when I think about baseball.

1128
01:26:08,287 --> 01:26:09,872
Strike! You're out!

1129
01:26:10,288 --> 01:26:11,873
But this does not compute.

1130
01:26:12,291 --> 01:26:12,832
What?

1131
01:26:13,292 --> 01:26:15,920
Robot tried to destroy
the Robinson family.

1132
01:26:16,295 --> 01:26:18,921
Why did Will Robinson
save Robot's personality?

1133
01:26:19,297 --> 01:26:22,967
I guess sometimes friendship
means listening to your heart...

1134
01:26:23,301 --> 01:26:23,801
not your head.

1135
01:26:24,301 --> 01:26:26,887
Put that in your memory bank.

1136
01:26:28,305 --> 01:26:29,890
Don't worry.

1137
01:26:33,310 --> 01:26:33,810
I'm going to build you
a new body.

1138
01:26:36,313 --> 01:26:38,899
Mom always said I should
try to make new friends.

1139
01:26:47,323 --> 01:26:48,867
I need a microsealer.

1140
01:26:49,283 --> 01:26:50,868
I got it.

1141
01:26:58,292 --> 01:26:59,835
After much deliberation...

1142
01:27:00,293 --> 01:27:01,837
the space captive
has finally decided...

1143
01:27:02,295 --> 01:27:05,966
to accept her new role
as a member of the crew.

1144
01:27:06,341 --> 01:27:08,885
The Robinsons, after all,
can obviously use her help.

1145
01:27:11,345 --> 01:27:12,889
Blarp, come back here.

1146
01:27:13,305 --> 01:27:15,890
Theoretically,
this future would be fixed...

1147
01:27:16,307 --> 01:27:18,935
unchanged by what we do
or did in the past--

1148
01:27:19,310 --> 01:27:20,895
Professor?

1149
01:27:21,313 --> 01:27:22,898
Why don't you give
the old egghead a rest?

1150
01:27:23,314 --> 01:27:28,027
Out here we got two moons,
a crater the size of Miami...

1151
01:27:28,319 --> 01:27:31,029
and that would be
one great climb.

1152
01:27:32,405 --> 01:27:32,864
My father would have liked you.

1153
01:27:39,412 --> 01:27:39,912
What's that?

1154
01:27:51,423 --> 01:27:52,966
This metal's decades old.

1155
01:27:53,426 --> 01:27:54,969
What kind of a nightmare
is this?

1156
01:27:57,387 --> 01:27:57,930
Where the hell are we?

1157
01:27:58,389 --> 01:27:59,972
The question is,
when the hell are we?

1158
01:28:22,368 --> 01:28:26,038
I will tell you a joke.

1159
01:28:26,372 --> 01:28:27,957
Why did the robot
cross the road?

1160
01:28:29,375 --> 01:28:32,002
Because he was carbon-bonded
to the chicken.

1161
01:28:32,377 --> 01:28:33,962
We have a lot of work to do.

1162
01:28:37,382 --> 01:28:40,010
That sounds like old Morse code.

1163
01:28:40,385 --> 01:28:40,927
What does it say?

1164
01:28:41,386 --> 01:28:43,971
"Danger,
Will Robinson, danger."

1165
01:29:08,368 --> 01:29:09,953
William. Come in.

1166
01:29:12,372 --> 01:29:12,914
Unlock.

1167
01:29:17,377 --> 01:29:18,962
You said someone was in danger.

1168
01:29:19,378 --> 01:29:20,922
We all are.

1169
01:29:21,381 --> 01:29:22,923
You are wise to arm yourself.

1170
01:29:23,382 --> 01:29:25,969
This gun is set to fire
for me only...

1171
01:29:26,386 --> 01:29:28,971
so don't try anything funny.
Lock.

1172
01:29:32,350 --> 01:29:37,061
You misjudge me.
I only want to help you.

1173
01:29:37,354 --> 01:29:39,981
Help us?
You tried to kill us.

1174
01:29:40,356 --> 01:29:41,942
But now our fates
are intertwined.

1175
01:29:42,359 --> 01:29:46,029
If your father
and that idiot West fail...

1176
01:29:46,363 --> 01:29:48,989
I have no chance
of getting home.

1177
01:29:49,364 --> 01:29:53,034
It's in my best interests
that they succeed...

1178
01:29:53,368 --> 01:29:57,038
and I always follow
my best interests.

1179
01:29:59,373 --> 01:30:07,172
What monsters roam
these alien wilds?

1180
01:30:07,381 --> 01:30:09,967
They're fools!

1181
01:30:10,385 --> 01:30:14,012
To set off blindly
across this savage land.

1182
01:30:16,347 --> 01:30:17,932
Much as I hate to admit it...

1183
01:30:19,350 --> 01:30:21,979
it will be much harder
without them.

1184
01:30:22,354 --> 01:30:24,980
What are you talking about?

1185
01:30:25,356 --> 01:30:27,984
They'll be back.
They'll be OK.

1186
01:30:30,360 --> 01:30:30,903
Will they?

1187
01:30:35,365 --> 01:30:36,908
Someone should go after them.

1188
01:30:37,368 --> 01:30:37,868
Unlock.

1189
01:30:38,368 --> 01:30:39,912
I forbid it. You're a boy.

1190
01:30:40,328 --> 01:30:40,871
A clever one,
but a child nonetheless.

1191
01:30:41,371 --> 01:30:43,957
This planet
is likely full of predators.

1192
01:30:44,332 --> 01:30:48,002
Even if you found them,
what if they're hurt? Ravaged?

1193
01:30:53,341 --> 01:30:53,882
Dying?

1194
01:30:57,344 --> 01:30:58,929
What good could you do?

1195
01:31:03,350 --> 01:31:05,935
You can help them.
You're a doctor.

1196
01:31:13,359 --> 01:31:14,902
I'm a doctor.

1197
01:31:17,363 --> 01:31:18,905
We made it.

1198
01:31:19,363 --> 01:31:21,949
Mom didn't see us.

1199
01:31:22,367 --> 01:31:23,909
That's fantastic.

1200
01:31:26,328 --> 01:31:28,957
I told them we could get
into the bubble this way.

1201
01:31:35,337 --> 01:31:35,880
The bubble's growing!

1202
01:31:41,342 --> 01:31:43,929
Run, child!

1203
01:32:00,319 --> 01:32:01,903
Cool.

1204
01:32:02,319 --> 01:32:03,904
Wait!

1205
01:32:10,328 --> 01:32:13,997
Come on.
We can always go back.

1206
01:32:14,332 --> 01:32:16,917
It's just like stepping
between two rooms.

1207
01:32:17,333 --> 01:32:18,877
I can barely contain my glee.

1208
01:32:20,337 --> 01:32:22,922
Dad's signal is...
this way.

1209
01:32:27,342 --> 01:32:28,886
I loathe children.

1210
01:32:49,322 --> 01:32:51,948
Billy...kissing...

1211
01:32:52,324 --> 01:32:56,996
hot wings, orchids, corn.

1212
01:32:59,288 --> 01:33:06,087
Waves...Billy...
popcorn with...kissing...

1213
01:33:06,296 --> 01:33:09,966
What did you find?

1214
01:33:10,298 --> 01:33:12,926
Come on.
No time to dawdle.

1215
01:33:13,301 --> 01:33:15,930
Let's move along.

1216
01:33:18,306 --> 01:33:20,893
Follow your father's signal.
There's a good boy.

1217
01:33:22,310 --> 01:33:22,810
Come on.

1218
01:33:52,296 --> 01:33:57,009
All things really do come
to he who waits.

1219
01:34:07,268 --> 01:34:07,810
What is this place?

1220
01:34:08,269 --> 01:34:10,896
The shock must have
scrambled your brain.

1221
01:34:11,271 --> 01:34:12,856
Take a look around.

1222
01:34:18,278 --> 01:34:19,863
Don't you recognize this spot?

1223
01:34:24,283 --> 01:34:26,869
You're home.

1224
01:34:32,291 --> 01:34:33,876
This can't be.

1225
01:34:34,292 --> 01:34:35,836
What have you done to the ship?

1226
01:34:38,296 --> 01:34:39,840
Where is my family?

1227
01:34:41,300 --> 01:34:44,927
What chance do you think
your family had without you?

1228
01:34:45,302 --> 01:34:48,931
A few spiders survived
the destruction of the Proteus.

1229
01:34:49,306 --> 01:34:50,850
They reached this planet and...

1230
01:34:56,271 --> 01:34:58,899
I can still hear
the women scream.

1231
01:35:03,278 --> 01:35:03,819
Who are you?

1232
01:35:05,279 --> 01:35:05,822
You don't recognize me?

1233
01:35:14,287 --> 01:35:16,873
I'm your son Will.

1234
01:35:21,252 --> 01:35:22,837
Dad's signal
is just over this ridge.

1235
01:35:23,255 --> 01:35:26,925
Be still, my foolish heart.

1236
01:35:27,257 --> 01:35:28,842
Shit.

1237
01:35:29,260 --> 01:35:31,929
A boy of your intelligence
should never swear.

1238
01:35:35,265 --> 01:35:36,891
Shit.

1239
01:35:41,313 --> 01:35:41,813
Indeed.

1240
01:35:46,317 --> 01:35:47,902
Look, Father...

1241
01:35:48,319 --> 01:35:54,115
what my flights of fancy
have wrought.

1242
01:35:55,408 --> 01:35:59,037
I used your hyper engine
to build my time machine.

1243
01:36:02,373 --> 01:36:03,958
OK, Robot, put him down.

1244
01:36:04,376 --> 01:36:04,917
Affirmative.

1245
01:36:11,381 --> 01:36:12,925
Where are we?

1246
01:36:13,384 --> 01:36:16,011
I think the Jupiter 2,
but in a different future.

1247
01:36:16,386 --> 01:36:17,930
Father?

1248
01:36:18,389 --> 01:36:18,889
Once this core material...

1249
01:36:19,389 --> 01:36:21,975
is fully introduced
into the control console...

1250
01:36:22,391 --> 01:36:24,978
Core material.

1251
01:36:25,353 --> 01:36:27,980
If we could get that
back to our Jupiter...

1252
01:36:28,355 --> 01:36:33,069
I will open a doorway
stable enough...

1253
01:36:33,360 --> 01:36:38,073
for one person to take
one trip through time...

1254
01:36:38,364 --> 01:36:40,993
and space as well.

1255
01:36:41,368 --> 01:36:43,994
Commence proto-generation.

1256
01:36:45,372 --> 01:36:46,956
Cool, huh?

1257
01:36:47,372 --> 01:36:51,042
Today, I will change history.

1258
01:36:53,378 --> 01:36:55,965
I'm gonna go back to that day
you dragged us into space.

1259
01:36:58,384 --> 01:36:59,926
I'll stop the ship
from taking off.

1260
01:37:04,389 --> 01:37:05,931
I'll save the family.

1261
01:37:06,390 --> 01:37:08,976
Earth, October 1, 2058.

1262
01:37:09,351 --> 01:37:10,936
Target lock confirmed.

1263
01:37:11,354 --> 01:37:11,895
Excellent.

1264
01:37:12,354 --> 01:37:12,896
Son...

1265
01:37:15,356 --> 01:37:16,942
Look around.

1266
01:37:17,359 --> 01:37:20,988
The force of your time machine
is ripping this planet apart.

1267
01:37:21,363 --> 01:37:22,905
These violent distortions
in time...

1268
01:37:23,364 --> 01:37:25,992
are being caused
by your experiment.

1269
01:37:26,368 --> 01:37:28,953
What if it has the same effect
on Earth?

1270
01:37:29,369 --> 01:37:30,912
What if, in getting home...

1271
01:37:31,372 --> 01:37:32,914
you destroy Earth
in the process?

1272
01:37:41,340 --> 01:37:41,881
I know you mean well.

1273
01:37:42,341 --> 01:37:46,011
I'm going home.

1274
01:37:46,344 --> 01:37:47,929
I'm going to save the family.

1275
01:37:48,345 --> 01:37:50,972
You've got to listen to me.
I'm your father!

1276
01:37:52,350 --> 01:37:53,934
My father?

1277
01:37:56,353 --> 01:37:58,939
Let me tell you about my father.

1278
01:37:59,355 --> 01:38:01,942
I'll never forget
that morning 20 years ago.

1279
01:38:02,359 --> 01:38:03,902
What was it you said?

1280
01:38:05,362 --> 01:38:06,904
"l'm coming back.
I promise."

1281
01:38:07,363 --> 01:38:09,948
You promised...
and you never came home.

1282
01:38:10,365 --> 01:38:13,994
My father's not
coming to the rescue.

1283
01:38:38,350 --> 01:38:39,893
What do you think you're doing,
young man?

1284
01:38:40,351 --> 01:38:41,895
Let me tell you about life.

1285
01:38:43,313 --> 01:38:43,854
Around every corner,
monsters wait.

1286
01:38:45,314 --> 01:38:45,856
I know. I am one.

1287
01:38:46,315 --> 01:38:49,985
We monsters have no fear
in devouring little boys.

1288
01:38:50,319 --> 01:38:51,904
To survive, you must be
fully prepared to kill.

1289
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:53,905
I can do it.

1290
01:38:54,323 --> 01:38:54,864
Can you?

1291
01:38:58,327 --> 01:38:59,912
Listen to me, my child...

1292
01:39:00,328 --> 01:39:02,913
I've crossed this world
with you...

1293
01:39:03,331 --> 01:39:07,001
risked my life,
but I would not throw it away.

1294
01:39:07,335 --> 01:39:09,921
Who knows what dangers
lie ahead?

1295
01:39:11,338 --> 01:39:12,881
You can't protect us.

1296
01:39:14,341 --> 01:39:14,841
I can.

1297
01:39:17,344 --> 01:39:17,845
I will.

1298
01:39:20,346 --> 01:39:22,932
Gimme the gun.

1299
01:39:23,350 --> 01:39:24,893
Enable gun for all users.

1300
01:39:25,351 --> 01:39:25,851
Voiceprint confirmed.

1301
01:39:28,313 --> 01:39:31,983
A brief lesson in survival
on this world or any other--

1302
01:39:32,315 --> 01:39:35,985
never trust anyone.
Especially me.

1303
01:39:40,323 --> 01:39:42,951
It's almost time.
I hope it works.

1304
01:39:43,326 --> 01:39:43,827
Never fear...

1305
01:39:46,328 --> 01:39:46,829
Smith is here.

1306
01:39:48,331 --> 01:39:49,873
Don't move,
Professor Robinson...

1307
01:39:50,332 --> 01:39:53,961
or this peculiar family reunion
will be tragically brief.

1308
01:39:54,295 --> 01:39:55,880
I'll ask you
to step away from that.

1309
01:39:56,296 --> 01:39:57,881
It's a time machine,
you idiot.

1310
01:39:58,297 --> 01:40:00,926
I had hoped to take over
the ship with this.

1311
01:40:01,301 --> 01:40:04,970
One of life's little ironies.

1312
01:40:05,305 --> 01:40:07,931
Let's try this dance again.

1313
01:40:08,307 --> 01:40:10,935
You are the puppet,
I am the puppeteer.

1314
01:40:11,310 --> 01:40:13,895
Do try to get it right
this time.

1315
01:40:14,313 --> 01:40:17,983
Robot, you will respond
to my voice alone.

1316
01:40:18,317 --> 01:40:18,817
Affirmative.

1317
01:40:19,318 --> 01:40:20,860
We need electric disrupters.

1318
01:40:25,323 --> 01:40:26,865
That's good I met you.

1319
01:40:29,327 --> 01:40:32,954
You did it.
Just like I imagined.

1320
01:40:33,331 --> 01:40:34,873
You linked
the dimensional sifter...

1321
01:40:35,291 --> 01:40:35,832
to the navigational array.

1322
01:40:36,292 --> 01:40:38,918
That's how it can be in
the same place at the same time.

1323
01:40:39,293 --> 01:40:44,006
But the spatial delivery system,
the targeting laser...

1324
01:40:44,298 --> 01:40:45,841
I never thought of those.

1325
01:40:46,301 --> 01:40:49,929
The future is never what
it seems like when you're 10.

1326
01:40:50,304 --> 01:40:52,931
Say good-bye to your past!

1327
01:40:53,306 --> 01:40:55,893
Your future lies with me.

1328
01:40:56,310 --> 01:40:57,853
I'm going home in your place.

1329
01:41:01,273 --> 01:41:02,858
What are you grinning at?

1330
01:41:05,277 --> 01:41:09,988
Look around you...
at this hostile world.

1331
01:41:10,280 --> 01:41:13,951
Do you think a boy
could have survived all alone?

1332
01:41:15,286 --> 01:41:16,869
Never fear...
Smith is here.

1333
01:41:19,288 --> 01:41:20,873
It's Dr. Smith.

1334
01:41:21,291 --> 01:41:22,876
Hello.

1335
01:41:23,292 --> 01:41:25,878
How nice to see me again
after all these years.

1336
01:41:26,296 --> 01:41:28,881
Confused?
Have I changed?

1337
01:41:29,298 --> 01:41:32,926
The spider's sting had some
unexpected side effects.

1338
01:41:33,301 --> 01:41:35,887
My unique gifts
gave me an advantage...

1339
01:41:36,305 --> 01:41:37,847
in this quarrelsome world.

1340
01:41:38,306 --> 01:41:40,893
After the women were savaged...

1341
01:41:41,310 --> 01:41:45,980
I became the father
Will never had.

1342
01:41:46,271 --> 01:41:52,028
Two decades of agony taught me
the error of my ways.

1343
01:41:52,278 --> 01:41:58,033
But you, your crude ambition
fills me with self-loathing.

1344
01:41:58,283 --> 01:42:00,911
You see,
I have looked within me...

1345
01:42:01,286 --> 01:42:03,872
and what I see is you!

1346
01:42:12,255 --> 01:42:14,881
I never liked me anyway.

1347
01:42:15,256 --> 01:42:16,841
Robot, kill them all.

1348
01:42:18,260 --> 01:42:19,845
Wait.

1349
01:42:20,261 --> 01:42:21,846
Dr. Smith, please.

1350
01:42:25,266 --> 01:42:26,850
Don't.

1351
01:42:33,274 --> 01:42:34,859
Very well.

1352
01:42:35,275 --> 01:42:37,860
Robot, take them inside
and keep them there.

1353
01:42:38,278 --> 01:42:41,907
If they move...
then kill them.

1354
01:42:42,282 --> 01:42:44,868
Proceed or be destroyed.

1355
01:43:08,264 --> 01:43:08,805
Nothing works.

1356
01:43:12,268 --> 01:43:13,810
I'll draw his fire,
you grab Will and get out.

1357
01:43:14,270 --> 01:43:14,770
Halt!

1358
01:43:16,271 --> 01:43:17,814
Stop!

1359
01:43:20,234 --> 01:43:21,818
Do you remember me?

1360
01:43:22,234 --> 01:43:24,863
Do you remember what I
taught you about friendship?

1361
01:43:29,242 --> 01:43:31,868
I need you to help us now,
because we're friends.

1362
01:43:32,244 --> 01:43:34,872
Logic error.
Friendship does not compute.

1363
01:43:35,247 --> 01:43:37,875
Forget logic.
Act with your heart.

1364
01:43:38,250 --> 01:43:40,836
Robot has no heart.

1365
01:43:41,252 --> 01:43:43,838
Robot is powered by
a fusion pulse generator.

1366
01:43:44,256 --> 01:43:45,840
Every living thing has a heart.

1367
01:43:46,256 --> 01:43:48,842
My programming has been modified
to remove all emotion.

1368
01:43:49,260 --> 01:43:50,802
Any attempts to override
command protocols...

1369
01:43:52,305 --> 01:43:53,847
may result in fusing
my neural net.

1370
01:43:58,310 --> 01:43:58,810
Please, Robot?

1371
01:43:59,310 --> 01:44:00,854
If you don't let us go,
we're all gonna die.

1372
01:44:01,313 --> 01:44:03,939
I'm asking you now,
will you help us?

1373
01:44:06,317 --> 01:44:06,859
Will you be my friend?

1374
01:44:11,363 --> 01:44:13,990
Robot attempting
to deactivate control bolt.

1375
01:44:14,367 --> 01:44:16,993
-Commands overridden!
-Do it!

1376
01:44:17,368 --> 01:44:18,912
Destroy Robinson family!

1377
01:44:20,372 --> 01:44:20,872
Destroy!

1378
01:44:32,341 --> 01:44:32,882
You did it.

1379
01:44:35,344 --> 01:44:37,970
Robot will save Will Robinson.

1380
01:44:38,346 --> 01:44:39,931
Robot will save his friend.

1381
01:44:44,351 --> 01:44:45,936
Where are they?

1382
01:45:00,367 --> 01:45:00,867
Wait here.

1383
01:45:02,368 --> 01:45:03,912
Without that core...

1384
01:45:04,371 --> 01:45:05,913
I can't promise
we'll get off this rock.

1385
01:45:06,372 --> 01:45:08,957
See if you can make it
back to our Jupiter.

1386
01:45:09,375 --> 01:45:09,876
I'll get the core material
and meet you there.

1387
01:45:10,376 --> 01:45:11,918
We don't have the trackers
to find our way back.

1388
01:45:13,337 --> 01:45:14,921
The family needs their father.

1389
01:45:15,338 --> 01:45:16,923
The crew needs their pilot.

1390
01:45:17,341 --> 01:45:21,011
I can't fly the ship
as well as you can.

1391
01:45:21,345 --> 01:45:22,887
You're their best chance
to survive.

1392
01:45:24,346 --> 01:45:25,890
Listen to me.

1393
01:45:26,349 --> 01:45:27,891
I know you never wanted
to take this job.

1394
01:45:28,350 --> 01:45:31,979
I think you're going to turn out
to be a grade-A baby-sitter.

1395
01:45:32,354 --> 01:45:35,983
So...
the camper's all yours now.

1396
01:45:36,358 --> 01:45:37,900
Take care of them.

1397
01:45:39,319 --> 01:45:39,862
Good luck.

1398
01:45:40,319 --> 01:45:41,904
-Dad!
-Professor!

1399
01:45:45,324 --> 01:45:47,952
Remember the space spiders
in the Proteus?

1400
01:45:52,331 --> 01:45:52,872
They're not going to be able
to get back.

1401
01:45:57,336 --> 01:45:58,921
Enable all missiles.

1402
01:46:00,338 --> 01:46:01,922
But the warheads don't work.

1403
01:46:02,340 --> 01:46:02,841
Just do it.

1404
01:46:06,344 --> 01:46:06,845
Look!

1405
01:46:12,350 --> 01:46:14,935
Damn, he's still breathing.

1406
01:46:18,354 --> 01:46:18,855
Fire in the hole.

1407
01:46:26,320 --> 01:46:28,948
So these sailors,
they drew shapes in the sky...

1408
01:46:32,326 --> 01:46:33,868
Look! It's a flare!

1409
01:46:36,329 --> 01:46:37,872
...to help them
find their way home.

1410
01:46:38,332 --> 01:46:39,875
Danger, Will Robinson!

1411
01:46:55,305 --> 01:46:57,932
Climb on! Hurry!

1412
01:47:08,318 --> 01:47:10,903
Field dampeners on-line.

1413
01:47:11,319 --> 01:47:12,904
Portal compression commenced.

1414
01:47:23,331 --> 01:47:26,960
Tell me again, old monster,
how did the girls die?

1415
01:47:27,335 --> 01:47:30,962
We've been over this before,
son.

1416
01:47:34,300 --> 01:47:35,885
In all the years since...

1417
01:47:38,302 --> 01:47:40,930
the spiders
have never resurfaced.

1418
01:47:44,309 --> 01:47:44,850
Why?

1419
01:47:45,310 --> 01:47:50,023
Let's forget the past.

1420
01:47:54,318 --> 01:47:57,945
Portal aperture reduction, 50%%%.

1421
01:48:03,284 --> 01:48:05,912
Careful, child!
The plasma around the portal...

1422
01:48:06,287 --> 01:48:07,872
will rip a man into pieces!

1423
01:48:14,295 --> 01:48:17,965
Haven't you made the doorway...
too small?

1424
01:48:18,297 --> 01:48:19,882
Not for me.

1425
01:48:21,301 --> 01:48:23,886
But then I'm not going, am l?

1426
01:48:24,304 --> 01:48:26,890
Spiders didn't kill the girls.

1427
01:48:28,307 --> 01:48:29,850
It was you.

1428
01:48:30,309 --> 01:48:32,895
I just never let myself see it.

1429
01:48:33,311 --> 01:48:35,898
You kept me alive
because you needed me.

1430
01:48:37,315 --> 01:48:38,859
Because I could
build this for you.

1431
01:48:40,277 --> 01:48:42,904
Poor boy.

1432
01:48:43,279 --> 01:48:46,949
Did you really think
I would let you go?

1433
01:48:47,283 --> 01:48:52,997
Let all that I have become
vanish?

1434
01:48:53,288 --> 01:48:55,916
Look at me!
I am no mere man!

1435
01:48:56,292 --> 01:49:00,962
I...am...a...god!

1436
01:49:01,296 --> 01:49:02,838
Within these egg sacs
grow the seeds...

1437
01:49:03,297 --> 01:49:05,884
of a master race of spiders.

1438
01:49:06,259 --> 01:49:08,886
We shall descend upon
helpless Earth...

1439
01:49:09,261 --> 01:49:10,846
an entire planet to rule!

1440
01:49:11,264 --> 01:49:13,890
An entire planet
on which to feed!

1441
01:49:16,268 --> 01:49:18,895
Time to die...son.

1442
01:49:19,270 --> 01:49:20,855
I'm not your son.

1443
01:49:21,273 --> 01:49:23,859
Good-bye.

1444
01:49:36,287 --> 01:49:36,787
My father once said...

1445
01:49:39,288 --> 01:49:40,832
Evil always finds its true form.

1446
01:49:42,292 --> 01:49:44,877
You should have killed me
when you had the chance.

1447
01:49:45,295 --> 01:49:47,881
You were right.
I couldn't kill the man...

1448
01:49:49,256 --> 01:49:50,841
but I can kill the monster!

1449
01:49:54,261 --> 01:49:57,930
Spare me
the fuming of the righteous.

1450
01:49:59,265 --> 01:50:03,979
I think there's time for a snack
before my trip.

1451
01:50:11,277 --> 01:50:11,777
The pain.

1452
01:50:14,238 --> 01:50:15,823
You ain't seen nothing yet.

1453
01:50:24,247 --> 01:50:25,832
Remember the Proteus?

1454
01:50:26,248 --> 01:50:27,833
These monsters
eat their wounded.

1455
01:50:42,264 --> 01:50:44,849
Take all the time you want
to die!

1456
01:51:17,253 --> 01:51:20,881
Wake up, son!

1457
01:51:21,257 --> 01:51:21,757
Dad?

1458
01:51:29,222 --> 01:51:31,850
Core material insertion
complete.

1459
01:51:34,228 --> 01:51:37,898
All table run--2058.

1460
01:51:38,231 --> 01:51:38,774
Mission control.

1461
01:51:39,233 --> 01:51:42,903
You could've taken the core
and left before it was too late.

1462
01:51:43,235 --> 01:51:45,822
I couldn't let you fall.

1463
01:51:46,238 --> 01:51:46,739
You're my boy.

1464
01:51:55,247 --> 01:51:56,789
Mom ! It's them.

1465
01:52:03,255 --> 01:52:04,797
Oh, Mom !

1466
01:52:07,216 --> 01:52:07,759
You all right?

1467
01:52:08,217 --> 01:52:09,844
You're not as dumb as you look.

1468
01:52:10,261 --> 01:52:10,761
I'm going to get your name
tattooed right here.

1469
01:52:13,264 --> 01:52:14,849
Greetings.

1470
01:52:15,265 --> 01:52:16,809
Where's John?

1471
01:52:20,270 --> 01:52:20,811
The bubble closed behind us.

1472
01:52:21,270 --> 01:52:24,899
It was his only way back.

1473
01:52:25,317 --> 01:52:26,859
I'm sorry.

1474
01:52:29,319 --> 01:52:31,948
We've already begun
the preflight countdown.

1475
01:52:32,323 --> 01:52:33,908
I'm going to save
as many lives as I can.

1476
01:52:46,336 --> 01:52:47,921
I kept hoping somehow
he'd make it back.

1477
01:52:55,344 --> 01:52:55,845
Let's go, Major.

1478
01:52:58,346 --> 01:52:58,846
Good-bye, my love.

1479
01:53:00,349 --> 01:53:01,891
Engaging primary thrusters now.

1480
01:53:39,342 --> 01:53:41,927
Look. He made it.

1481
01:53:54,314 --> 01:53:56,942
Go.

1482
01:54:04,323 --> 01:54:05,908
We're not getting any altitude.

1483
01:54:06,326 --> 01:54:08,912
We don't have enough power.

1484
01:54:18,337 --> 01:54:18,837
I'm sorry.

1485
01:54:37,313 --> 01:54:38,855
I couldn't save them.

1486
01:54:44,319 --> 01:54:46,904
So many years ago.

1487
01:54:47,322 --> 01:54:48,864
I can still feel it--

1488
01:54:49,282 --> 01:54:50,867
our sun...

1489
01:54:52,284 --> 01:54:53,868
our Earth.

1490
01:54:56,287 --> 01:54:59,957
It's all I've thought about--
going home.

1491
01:55:04,296 --> 01:55:05,880
A long time ago,
you told a small boy...

1492
01:55:06,296 --> 01:55:09,966
that one day he'd understand
how much his father loved him.

1493
01:55:12,302 --> 01:55:14,889
I could never see
how much you cared...

1494
01:55:18,307 --> 01:55:19,851
until now.

1495
01:55:20,310 --> 01:55:20,810
Come.

1496
01:55:21,310 --> 01:55:23,896
Let's go.

1497
01:55:26,315 --> 01:55:28,900
I kept hoping he'd make it back.

1498
01:55:29,319 --> 01:55:30,862
Good-bye, my love.

1499
01:55:34,280 --> 01:55:35,865
Look!

1500
01:55:37,283 --> 01:55:39,912
Don't make me wait another
lifetime to know how you feel.

1501
01:55:50,296 --> 01:55:51,838
Dad!

1502
01:55:57,302 --> 01:56:00,930
Dad, it worked!

1503
01:56:02,265 --> 01:56:02,807
Come with us!

1504
01:56:03,265 --> 01:56:05,894
I can't.

1505
01:56:06,269 --> 01:56:09,939
Only enough power for
one person, one trip, remember?

1506
01:56:15,277 --> 01:56:16,862
It's good to see you again, Mom.

1507
01:56:17,279 --> 01:56:19,864
It's good to see you all.

1508
01:56:20,282 --> 01:56:21,867
Take care of them, Will.

1509
01:56:29,289 --> 01:56:31,876
Don't forget me.

1510
01:56:33,293 --> 01:56:34,837
He sacrificed everything
for his family.

1511
01:56:43,261 --> 01:56:43,802
I'm glad you came back.

1512
01:56:46,264 --> 01:56:48,890
I just want you to know
I love you.

1513
01:56:50,268 --> 01:56:52,895
I love you very much.

1514
01:57:00,277 --> 01:57:02,863
The planet
is breaking up around us.

1515
01:57:09,243 --> 01:57:11,871
We're doomed!

1516
01:57:17,251 --> 01:57:17,792
Boy, that felt good.

1517
01:57:18,252 --> 01:57:19,837
Get us airborne.

1518
01:57:22,255 --> 01:57:24,882
I'm going to try
to reach escape velocity.

1519
01:57:25,257 --> 01:57:26,842
We don't have the core material.

1520
01:57:27,260 --> 01:57:28,845
The gravity wells
will pull us back down.

1521
01:57:29,261 --> 01:57:29,761
We might be able to--

1522
01:57:30,262 --> 01:57:32,847
We won't make it. I know.

1523
01:57:35,266 --> 01:57:35,768
We have to go...

1524
01:57:38,270 --> 01:57:39,813
down--

1525
01:57:40,271 --> 01:57:42,858
through the planet
as she's breaking up.

1526
01:57:43,274 --> 01:57:45,859
We can use
the planet's gravity...

1527
01:57:46,277 --> 01:57:46,778
What?

1528
01:57:47,278 --> 01:57:50,907
to throw us out the other side
and back into space.

1529
01:57:51,239 --> 01:57:51,782
That's insane.

1530
01:57:52,240 --> 01:57:53,826
I don't have time to argue.

1531
01:57:59,247 --> 01:57:59,789
That's a direct order.

1532
01:58:03,251 --> 01:58:03,792
Yes, sir, commander.

1533
01:58:06,253 --> 01:58:07,796
This should be interesting.

1534
01:58:40,243 --> 01:58:41,828
I see it.

1535
01:58:42,244 --> 01:58:42,746
Full burn.

1536
01:58:53,255 --> 01:58:53,756
Stop!

1537
01:58:54,256 --> 01:58:55,798
-Right!
-Left!

1538
01:58:56,257 --> 01:58:56,759
Let me drive.

1539
01:59:05,225 --> 01:59:07,851
All right, everybody,
hold your noses.

1540
01:59:29,204 --> 01:59:31,832
Rock and roll.

1541
02:00:01,234 --> 02:00:03,819
Amazing.

1542
02:00:11,202 --> 02:00:12,787
Nice work, flyboy.

1543
02:00:13,203 --> 02:00:15,831
I earn that kiss yet?

1544
02:00:16,207 --> 02:00:16,748
You earn this.

1545
02:00:24,213 --> 02:00:25,756
This one's on credit.

1546
02:00:35,224 --> 02:00:36,809
Cold fish, huh?

1547
02:00:56,327 --> 02:00:57,911
There you are. Come here.

1548
02:00:59,328 --> 02:01:02,957
Where have you been,
you little creep?

1549
02:01:03,332 --> 02:01:04,876
-Little creep?
-Oh, great.

1550
02:01:05,335 --> 02:01:06,877
Warning, Major West.

1551
02:01:07,337 --> 02:01:09,921
My sensors indicate
we have a problem.

1552
02:01:14,342 --> 02:01:16,929
The planet's gravity field
is collapsing.

1553
02:01:17,304 --> 02:01:17,845
We'll be sucked in.

1554
02:01:18,305 --> 02:01:19,890
No way to get clear in time.

1555
02:01:20,306 --> 02:01:21,891
The hyperdrive.

1556
02:01:22,309 --> 02:01:23,894
I'm accessing
the Proteus star maps.

1557
02:01:25,311 --> 02:01:25,854
Here we go again.

1558
02:01:26,311 --> 02:01:27,855
Targeting Alpha Prime...
I hope.

1559
02:01:30,315 --> 02:01:32,944
Initiate...now.

1560
02:01:33,319 --> 02:01:33,819
Cool.
