1
00:07:44,161 --> 00:07:45,497
Where are you going?

2
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:48,233
The kitchen to
get something to eat.

3
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:49,802
You want something?

4
00:07:50,869 --> 00:07:52,536
Oh, Jesus.

5
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:54,238
John, you scared...

6
00:07:54,672 --> 00:07:55,672
John.

7
00:07:56,841 --> 00:07:57,841
John?

8
00:07:58,843 --> 00:08:00,411
You're asleep.

9
00:08:01,011 --> 00:08:02,447
Go back to bed.

10
00:08:02,581 --> 00:08:03,613
John, let go.

11
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:04,749
John.

12
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:07,586
Let go. John!

13
00:08:08,386 --> 00:08:11,322
John, wake up. Wake up.
John... Oh, John.

14
00:08:11,456 --> 00:08:12,456
John. John!

15
00:08:12,555 --> 00:08:14,055
Wake up!

16
00:08:22,901 --> 00:08:24,636
"Feeling suddenly scared
for no reason?"

17
00:08:24,769 --> 00:08:26,127
Yes. "Experiencing
night terrors,

18
00:08:26,228 --> 00:08:28,538
difficulty sleeping."
That's a yes.

19
00:08:28,673 --> 00:08:31,944
"Spells of terror or panic,
hopelessness about the future." Yes.

20
00:08:32,076 --> 00:08:34,611
- "Thoughts of ending your life."
- Are you finished?

21
00:08:35,546 --> 00:08:38,282
I mean, I don't know what
you want me to do here.

22
00:08:38,415 --> 00:08:41,552
- They're dreams, Richard.
- They're night terrors, John.

23
00:08:41,686 --> 00:08:43,520
And this one turned violent.

24
00:08:43,654 --> 00:08:44,822
Now, I'm very sorry,

25
00:08:44,956 --> 00:08:46,636
but I've given you
more than enough time,

26
00:08:46,756 --> 00:08:50,260
and we cannot fix this.

27
00:08:50,394 --> 00:08:51,962
I am fine.

28
00:08:52,096 --> 00:08:53,365
The crew is fine.

29
00:08:53,496 --> 00:08:55,495
Come on. Half the crew's
sleeping 15 hours a day,

30
00:08:55,595 --> 00:08:57,153
and the other half
can't sleep at all.

31
00:08:57,253 --> 00:08:58,530
We have problems
of aggression,

32
00:08:58,635 --> 00:08:59,837
of depression, of isolation.

33
00:08:59,971 --> 00:09:01,807
Ten years.
That's the mission.

34
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,375
Yes, ten years.
And we're five years in.

35
00:09:04,509 --> 00:09:05,947
And you think this gets
any easier?

36
00:09:06,048 --> 00:09:07,345
What's going to happen

37
00:09:07,477 --> 00:09:10,681
when your night terrors
start manifesting themselves

38
00:09:10,815 --> 00:09:12,116
as hallucinations?

39
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,988
Or I start decorating
the walls with my own feces?

40
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,423
- This isn't a joke.
- I'm not happy about this either.

41
00:09:19,557 --> 00:09:21,793
You're a great captain.
This is a great crew.

42
00:09:21,926 --> 00:09:25,895
But I'm afraid we're just no
longer fit to continue our mission.

43
00:09:26,029 --> 00:09:27,600
I'm sorry, John.

44
00:09:28,366 --> 00:09:30,269
I'm gonna have to recommend...

45
00:09:31,501 --> 00:09:33,337
removal from Pangea.

46
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:43,080
Shoot.

47
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,918
Pangea, call Jenny Miller.

48
00:09:47,051 --> 00:09:48,351
<i>Connecting.</i>

49
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,258
<i>Unable to locate.</i>

50
00:09:55,426 --> 00:09:59,062
Let's try this.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

51
00:09:59,197 --> 00:10:01,166
These things'll kill ya.

52
00:10:03,668 --> 00:10:06,138
Okay. Richard, get us started?

53
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:10,174
Life
support, stable, 92%. Told.

54
00:10:10,308 --> 00:10:11,610
Nothing to report.
Told.

55
00:10:11,743 --> 00:10:13,020
Home isn't returning
our calls.

56
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,120
- How long?
- Ten hours.

57
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,498
COMM's good.
It's on their end.

58
00:10:15,597 --> 00:10:17,581
Most sophisticated technology
in the world,

59
00:10:17,716 --> 00:10:20,051
and ya can't make
a long-distance phone call.

60
00:10:20,183 --> 00:10:22,153
I'll try again next pass.
All told.

61
00:10:22,286 --> 00:10:24,321
Thank you.
Is there anything else?

62
00:10:24,455 --> 00:10:25,455
Nope.

63
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:28,326
Want you to read these
carefully.

64
00:10:31,562 --> 00:10:35,067
Anything, uh, rings untrue,
let me know.

65
00:10:36,668 --> 00:10:38,736
"No longer mentally fit"?

66
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,270
- We're not crazy.
- Oh.

67
00:10:40,404 --> 00:10:42,039
- No.
- No, Lisa's not crazy.

68
00:10:42,173 --> 00:10:43,475
No, but I want to stay.

69
00:10:43,606 --> 00:10:45,125
Well,
this isn't about what you want.

70
00:10:45,225 --> 00:10:46,702
This is about
what we're capable of.

71
00:10:46,802 --> 00:10:48,413
- We're not capable anymore.
- I am.

72
00:10:48,546 --> 00:10:50,306
Okay, well, after I make
my recommendation,

73
00:10:50,414 --> 00:10:52,250
Home will conduct
their own evaluation,

74
00:10:52,383 --> 00:10:54,918
and their thing
is based on everybody.

75
00:10:55,052 --> 00:10:56,855
One person fails
and we will go home.

76
00:10:56,988 --> 00:10:58,121
Oh, what happens if we stay?

77
00:10:58,255 --> 00:10:59,789
If, you know,
we don't say anything?

78
00:10:59,923 --> 00:11:01,491
- Maybe nothing.
- Or?

79
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:04,261
Or we slowly continue
to drift apart.

80
00:11:04,395 --> 00:11:07,130
We become increasingly
isolated from one another.

81
00:11:07,264 --> 00:11:09,668
And it snowballs until
one day a search party

82
00:11:09,801 --> 00:11:13,471
is sent out to find us,
and what do they find?

83
00:11:13,604 --> 00:11:15,038
Who knows?

84
00:11:15,905 --> 00:11:17,575
But it won't be us.

85
00:11:18,241 --> 00:11:19,943
Not as we are today.

86
00:11:20,077 --> 00:11:21,278
Jesus!

87
00:11:21,544 --> 00:11:24,215
Richard, we just lost
our careers!

88
00:11:24,347 --> 00:11:25,783
Wait, why would
I lose my career?

89
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:27,018
No one is losing anything.

90
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,284
They're going to recommend

91
00:11:28,419 --> 00:11:30,187
that we be removed
from Pangea

92
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,422
due to mental instability,

93
00:11:31,554 --> 00:11:34,390
forcing Home to send
replacement crews

94
00:11:34,524 --> 00:11:36,125
five years ahead of schedule.

95
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:41,033
We will never set foot
in a station again!

96
00:11:50,341 --> 00:11:51,741
Jackie!

97
00:11:52,243 --> 00:11:53,943
Jackie, stop!

98
00:11:57,548 --> 00:12:00,384
- Talk to me.
- <i>Heating ventilation restored.</i>

99
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:04,022
I sacrificed everything
to be a part of this.

100
00:12:04,154 --> 00:12:05,789
I left my daughter.

101
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,025
And because of you,
it was for nothing.

102
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:11,761
So I will finish my duties
until I'm relieved,

103
00:12:11,895 --> 00:12:15,332
but until then, I don't wanna talk to
you, I don't wanna look at you.

104
00:12:15,466 --> 00:12:17,702
- Jackie.
- Do you understand me?

105
00:12:33,918 --> 00:12:35,119
Again.

106
00:12:40,224 --> 00:12:43,193
It was so nice
when we got here.

107
00:12:43,327 --> 00:12:45,663
We were happy.

108
00:12:45,796 --> 00:12:47,799
Richard was showering.

109
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,735
We did great things.

110
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:55,374
I know it's not
your fault we lost our shooot.

111
00:12:55,505 --> 00:12:58,209
But we all saw it coming.

112
00:12:59,743 --> 00:13:01,611
Couldn't you have
done something?

113
00:13:20,597 --> 00:13:22,399
What the flap was that?

114
00:13:22,533 --> 00:13:24,691
- Did we blow a power cell?
- Negative, it wasn't us.

115
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:25,831
Can anyone confirm source?

116
00:13:26,602 --> 00:13:28,404
<i>Warning! Warning!</i>

117
00:13:28,539 --> 00:13:29,875
Everyone to stations!
Jackie?

118
00:13:30,006 --> 00:13:31,875
- Cell two's crashing.
- <i>Recalibrating.</i>

119
00:13:32,009 --> 00:13:33,644
One and three are stable.

120
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,981
<i>Recalibrating.</i>

121
00:13:37,115 --> 00:13:39,485
Power fuel backup, stable!

122
00:13:40,484 --> 00:13:41,485
One and three are off.

123
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,187
Negative results on source.

124
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,054
There's something wrong
with the scan.

125
00:13:45,188 --> 00:13:46,423
- Engaging manual.
- <i>Warning.</i>

126
00:13:46,557 --> 00:13:48,195
- Two's on its way out.
- <i>Total failure.</i>

127
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:50,293
We need Life Support
on backup before it crashes.

128
00:13:50,393 --> 00:13:51,393
Okay.

129
00:13:58,601 --> 00:14:02,139
<i>Richard, Life Support!
Richard?</i>

130
00:14:02,272 --> 00:14:04,241
<i>Richard's not responding.
Lisa, go!</i>

131
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:08,846
<i>John, what's happening?</i>

132
00:14:08,979 --> 00:14:10,777
Whatever it is,
it's not coming from Pangea.

133
00:14:10,876 --> 00:14:12,417
Opening bay doors for visual.

134
00:14:12,549 --> 00:14:14,919
<i>I've reached Support.
Richard's not here.</i>

135
00:14:15,052 --> 00:14:16,053
<i>Putting us on backup.</i>

136
00:14:16,186 --> 00:14:17,288
<i>Do we have cause?</i>

137
00:14:17,421 --> 00:14:19,456
<i>John, can you hear me?</i>

138
00:14:21,525 --> 00:14:22,725
Brace!

139
00:14:43,014 --> 00:14:45,783
Richard, Jackie.

140
00:14:46,183 --> 00:14:47,485
Respond.

141
00:14:56,794 --> 00:14:58,729
Why isn't
the intercom working?

142
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:02,933
Jackie, why isn't
anyone responding?

143
00:15:09,505 --> 00:15:10,908
How long was I out?

144
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:13,510
Um... I don't know.

145
00:15:14,245 --> 00:15:16,313
Did you move us
to backup power?

146
00:15:16,447 --> 00:15:18,716
Yeah, but we lost Cell Two.

147
00:15:19,448 --> 00:15:21,519
What the hell hit us?

148
00:15:23,288 --> 00:15:26,825
- Did you find a source?
- Not yet.

149
00:15:26,957 --> 00:15:28,957
And, um...

150
00:15:29,693 --> 00:15:30,995
there's...

151
00:15:31,729 --> 00:15:32,729
Lisa.

152
00:15:38,001 --> 00:15:39,568
I found her in Life Support.

153
00:15:39,702 --> 00:15:41,804
She must have been thrown
from the blast.

154
00:15:41,938 --> 00:15:44,842
- I'm doing what I can, but...
- Where's my medical officer?

155
00:15:55,986 --> 00:15:57,288
Why aren't you in Medical?

156
00:15:57,421 --> 00:16:00,857
He's been like this.
He won't talk, he won't move.

157
00:16:00,991 --> 00:16:04,128
You abandoned your post.
What happened?

158
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:07,331
I don't have time for this.
I want you in Medical now.

159
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,533
Don't make me repeat myself.

160
00:16:10,668 --> 00:16:13,772
Richard, your captain's
given you an order.

161
00:16:21,212 --> 00:16:22,746
I don't know.
I found him that way.

162
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:24,917
And you can't blame him
for what happened to Lisa.

163
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:27,293
- We were all thrown around.
- He abandoned his station.

164
00:16:27,394 --> 00:16:29,510
She shouldn't have been
in there in the first place.

165
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:31,208
The system's rebooting
and COMM's down.

166
00:16:31,308 --> 00:16:33,145
We're gonna have to wait
for Home to confirm.

167
00:16:33,245 --> 00:16:34,844
We haven't been
in contact with anyone?

168
00:16:34,943 --> 00:16:36,158
Well, what about the light?

169
00:16:36,293 --> 00:16:37,961
Did you see it?
It was a wave.

170
00:16:38,096 --> 00:16:39,865
You're saying you think
a light did this?

171
00:16:39,996 --> 00:16:41,631
I'm saying I saw a light.

172
00:16:42,567 --> 00:16:44,903
I want Lisa in CT as soon
as we're back online.

173
00:16:45,036 --> 00:16:47,432
If you can't get Richard to do his
job, I want him cabined.

174
00:16:47,532 --> 00:16:50,707
You can't cabin him if there's
something wrong with him, John.

175
00:16:52,476 --> 00:16:55,447
I forgot to ask.
Were you hurt?

176
00:16:56,779 --> 00:16:57,815
I'm fine.

177
00:16:59,283 --> 00:17:02,086
Good.
Do as your captain says.

178
00:17:06,522 --> 00:17:07,892
Richard.

179
00:17:10,827 --> 00:17:12,931
Richard, what are you doing?

180
00:17:14,432 --> 00:17:16,835
Richard, look at me.

181
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,742
This is Captain John
Laine of Pangea. Please respond.

182
00:17:29,813 --> 00:17:32,950
This is John Laine of Pangea.
Respond.

183
00:17:33,717 --> 00:17:35,552
Move to an open frequency.

184
00:17:38,556 --> 00:17:40,657
- What's that mean?
- I don't know.

185
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:43,260
I'm gonna try patching
through to Europa.

186
00:17:43,394 --> 00:17:45,596
All right, give me a visual.

187
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:46,932
- Now, Jackie.
- I'm try...

188
00:17:47,065 --> 00:17:48,666
It's non-responsive.

189
00:17:51,034 --> 00:17:52,302
Richard, is that you?

190
00:17:54,605 --> 00:17:56,708
Richard, please respond.

191
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:00,912
Go get him.

192
00:18:24,201 --> 00:18:26,037
Is he talking?

193
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:30,709
What's wrong?

194
00:18:38,616 --> 00:18:40,250
<i>Earth located.</i>

195
00:18:40,384 --> 00:18:42,752
<i>Unable to reach Home.</i>

196
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:15,986
<i>Scan complete.</i>

Captain John Laine
from Pangea calling Home.

204
00:20:37,268 --> 00:20:39,236
Please respond.

205
00:20:39,368 --> 00:20:42,972
I have Captain John Laine calling
from Pangea, calling Home.

206
00:20:43,106 --> 00:20:44,741
Please respond.

207
00:20:45,942 --> 00:20:48,680
Captain John Laine
from Pangea calling Home.

208
00:20:48,811 --> 00:20:50,279
Please respond.

209
00:20:51,146 --> 00:20:53,583
Captain John Laine
from Pangea calling Home.

210
00:20:53,715 --> 00:20:54,917
Please respond.

211
00:20:55,051 --> 00:20:56,486
Why haven't
we received anything?

212
00:20:56,619 --> 00:20:58,888
Satellite's down, COMM
malfunctioned, we're on backup.

213
00:20:59,021 --> 00:21:00,790
- I don't know.
- Did you do a scan?

214
00:21:00,924 --> 00:21:02,659
Every scan, every reading,
every update,

215
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:04,193
62 hours of radio silence.

216
00:21:04,327 --> 00:21:06,565
- Think it was an asteroid?
- We would have tracked it.

217
00:21:06,664 --> 00:21:07,664
- Nuclear?
- Come on.

218
00:21:07,763 --> 00:21:09,799
- Did you send a distress?
- I can't. COMM's down.

219
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,736
I have to wait
until I'm back online.

220
00:21:13,135 --> 00:21:15,372
- What do you wanna do about him?
- I want him cabined.

221
00:21:15,471 --> 00:21:16,875
You need me, John.

222
00:21:17,008 --> 00:21:20,010
- Jackie, please explain it to him.
- You knew, Richard.

223
00:21:20,144 --> 00:21:22,101
- It was a mistake, John.
- And you told no one.

224
00:21:22,201 --> 00:21:23,877
What do you want from me?
I was in shock.

225
00:21:23,978 --> 00:21:25,215
You're an astronaut
of Pangea.

226
00:21:25,316 --> 00:21:27,384
- You're not allowed to be in shock.
- Ha.

227
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:28,997
Take him to Medical.
Put Lisa in CT.

228
00:21:29,096 --> 00:21:30,989
Get us back online,
then I want him cabined.

229
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:37,327
What's wrong with Lisa?

230
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,583
<i>Full power restored.</i>

231
00:22:00,717 --> 00:22:02,519
<i>Recalibrating the systems.</i>

232
00:22:02,653 --> 00:22:04,320
We're back online.

233
00:22:06,088 --> 00:22:07,288
<i>Error.</i>

234
00:22:08,325 --> 00:22:09,525
<i>Error.</i>

235
00:22:10,461 --> 00:22:11,661
<i>Error.</i>

236
00:22:12,128 --> 00:22:14,998
Even if they sent a distress
signal the moment it happened,

237
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:16,799
we'd have received it by now,

238
00:22:16,933 --> 00:22:19,368
which means,
whatever did happen,

239
00:22:19,502 --> 00:22:22,240
they never even saw it coming.

240
00:22:23,507 --> 00:22:24,545
Are we back online or not?

241
00:22:24,644 --> 00:22:25,644
I lost Cell Two,

242
00:22:25,776 --> 00:22:27,778
so I can either run
a diagnostic

243
00:22:27,912 --> 00:22:30,882
or try reaching Earth,
but I can't do both.

244
00:22:31,013 --> 00:22:33,215
Well, contact Earth,
if someone's listening.

245
00:22:33,349 --> 00:22:34,884
If somebody's listening.

246
00:22:35,019 --> 00:22:36,854
Yes, until we confirm
what happened.

247
00:22:36,986 --> 00:22:38,722
Visual not enough
for you, is it?

248
00:22:38,856 --> 00:22:40,424
You know something we don't?

249
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:44,663
What about damage
we took during the event?

250
00:22:46,563 --> 00:22:47,798
- Jackie.
- Yeah.

251
00:22:47,932 --> 00:22:50,768
I, uh, narrowed it down
to the Docking Bay.

252
00:22:50,901 --> 00:22:51,969
I just haven't determined

253
00:22:52,101 --> 00:22:53,499
what exactly has
been damaged yet.

254
00:22:53,598 --> 00:22:55,072
Go find out what it is.

255
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:03,114
- How long until we know about Lisa?
- I don't know.

256
00:23:06,683 --> 00:23:08,684
You having a stroke,

257
00:23:08,818 --> 00:23:10,376
or have you got
something else to ask?

258
00:23:10,477 --> 00:23:12,957
During the event,
you abandoned Life Support.

259
00:23:14,057 --> 00:23:15,393
You were watching Earth?

260
00:23:19,496 --> 00:23:21,164
What did you see?

261
00:23:51,361 --> 00:23:52,930
Lisa's awake.

262
00:23:57,134 --> 00:23:59,502
We'll talk about
what happened later.

263
00:23:59,635 --> 00:24:00,635
How do you feel?

264
00:24:00,734 --> 00:24:02,874
About as good as you look.

265
00:24:03,007 --> 00:24:04,045
We were worried, you know.

266
00:24:04,144 --> 00:24:05,308
Hey, Doc.
How's my head?

267
00:24:05,442 --> 00:24:06,911
Oh, you're gonna be fine.

268
00:24:07,042 --> 00:24:08,645
You're tough as nails,
young lady.

269
00:24:08,778 --> 00:24:10,181
Really?
Because I feel like shooot.

270
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:14,219
- Well, we might have to amputate.
- Seriously?

271
00:24:14,351 --> 00:24:18,020
You're fine.
Rich is gonna fix you up, okay?

272
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:20,325
Breathe in.

273
00:24:21,924 --> 00:24:23,125
And out.

274
00:24:23,259 --> 00:24:26,163
She's gonna be fine.
If I could just operate

275
00:24:26,297 --> 00:24:27,963
and relieve the
pressure on her brain.

276
00:24:28,097 --> 00:24:29,695
Well, then operate.
What's the problem?

277
00:24:29,796 --> 00:24:31,769
If she doesn't make it
through surgery,

278
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:33,579
I think we should tell
her what happened.

279
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,905
- Absolutely not.
- Her parents were down there.

280
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:37,397
What would be the point,
Richard?

281
00:24:37,498 --> 00:24:39,474
It's not your decision,
is it?

282
00:24:39,608 --> 00:24:41,176
And it's not his either.

283
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:43,180
Would you back
me up on this, please?

284
00:24:46,517 --> 00:24:48,086
She should know.

285
00:24:53,323 --> 00:24:55,392
Just gonna take
a little reading here.

286
00:24:56,792 --> 00:24:57,792
Hey.

287
00:25:01,097 --> 00:25:02,633
These things
will kill ya.

288
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:05,269
I'm going to induce a coma,
which is gonna allow me

289
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:07,121
to relieve the pressure
around your brain.

290
00:25:07,221 --> 00:25:09,839
And Home?
They're coming for us?

291
00:25:09,972 --> 00:25:14,510
They are... They're
on their way as we speak.

292
00:25:15,546 --> 00:25:16,948
Let's get this over with.

293
00:25:21,683 --> 00:25:23,752
- What?
- Lie down.

294
00:25:23,885 --> 00:25:25,243
What the flap are you
looking at?

295
00:25:25,344 --> 00:25:26,741
- You're hemorrhaging.
- I'm what?

296
00:25:26,842 --> 00:25:28,680
- You're hemorrhaging.
- Oh, my God, Richard.

297
00:25:28,779 --> 00:25:30,616
Okay, I'm going to induce
the coma right now.

298
00:25:30,717 --> 00:25:32,555
- What's happening, Richard?
- Hold her down.

299
00:25:32,654 --> 00:25:33,772
Richard, get her a sedative.

300
00:25:33,873 --> 00:25:34,991
I'm moving as fast as I can.

301
00:25:35,198 --> 00:25:36,732
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, God.

302
00:25:36,866 --> 00:25:38,669
- For flap's sake! Richard!
- Give it time.

303
00:25:38,801 --> 00:25:40,537
- It's not working.
- Give it time!

304
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:42,006
- Lisa.
- Richard!

305
00:25:42,137 --> 00:25:43,339
- Lisa!
- Lisa.

306
00:25:43,472 --> 00:25:46,175
Lisa, stay with us.

307
00:25:46,308 --> 00:25:47,308
Lisa.

308
00:25:49,077 --> 00:25:52,015
Oh, God. Oh, my...

309
00:26:26,182 --> 00:26:27,982
<i>Scanning.</i>

310
00:26:32,888 --> 00:26:34,523
Where are you?

311
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:10,619
Captain John Laine of Pangea.
Please respond.

312
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:23,098
Two cells run in conjunction
with one another

313
00:28:23,232 --> 00:28:24,366
while the third one charges.

314
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,336
Then they cycle
and charge another.

315
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:30,140
With Cell Two down,
Life Support and Power

316
00:28:30,272 --> 00:28:31,641
are going to run out
very soon.

317
00:28:31,773 --> 00:28:33,572
Well, we can't replace it,
so what do we do?

318
00:28:33,672 --> 00:28:35,345
I mean, we could divert

319
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,115
all Life Support and Power
to Station One

320
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:39,817
and abandon Station Two
altogether.

321
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:41,484
I mean, that might reduce
the stress

322
00:28:41,616 --> 00:28:45,188
on the remaining cells
enough to run Pangea. Maybe.

323
00:28:45,322 --> 00:28:48,290
Which doesn't really matter
anymore, does it?

324
00:28:48,424 --> 00:28:50,493
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Earth is gone.

325
00:28:50,626 --> 00:28:53,630
No, no, Richard, we don't know
what's down there.

326
00:28:53,763 --> 00:28:56,700
You really can't be
this flaping stupid.

327
00:28:56,834 --> 00:28:58,169
There could be survivors!

328
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:01,605
Pangea, would you please
locate Jenny Miller.

329
00:29:01,739 --> 00:29:03,073
- <i>Accessing.</i>
- Pangea, stop!

330
00:29:03,205 --> 00:29:04,340
What the flap, Richard?

331
00:29:04,473 --> 00:29:05,791
We've been trying
to communicate

332
00:29:05,892 --> 00:29:07,490
with them down there
for the past week,

333
00:29:07,589 --> 00:29:09,078
and nobody's flaping
answering us.

334
00:29:09,212 --> 00:29:11,115
So wake the flap up!

335
00:29:12,883 --> 00:29:14,585
We're all that's left now,

336
00:29:14,717 --> 00:29:16,913
and that's what we should be
talking about right here.

337
00:29:17,013 --> 00:29:18,491
- I wanna take the escape pod.
- No.

338
00:29:18,592 --> 00:29:20,109
Priority is maintaining
Life Support.

339
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:23,058
The priority are survivors,
if there are any!

340
00:29:23,192 --> 00:29:25,260
It's a three-month trip
to Earth.

341
00:29:25,394 --> 00:29:27,872
- We can make the trip, Richard.
- But we can't make it back.

342
00:29:27,971 --> 00:29:30,128
What are we going to eat?
What are we going to drink?

343
00:29:30,229 --> 00:29:31,386
What are we going to breathe?

344
00:29:31,487 --> 00:29:33,044
We don't have enough fuel
to get back,

345
00:29:33,144 --> 00:29:35,972
so are we just gonna float
around until we suffocate?

346
00:29:36,106 --> 00:29:37,473
flap's sake, man!

347
00:29:40,041 --> 00:29:41,545
Jackie...

348
00:29:44,647 --> 00:29:47,818
if I thought we could
get you to her, I would.

349
00:29:54,023 --> 00:29:55,258
He's right.

350
00:30:14,711 --> 00:30:15,878
The pod.

351
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,383
Could it reach Europa?

352
00:30:19,515 --> 00:30:21,651
I just told you that
it doesn't matter.

353
00:30:21,786 --> 00:30:23,820
We have to try, Richard.

354
00:30:29,125 --> 00:30:30,693
We have to try.

355
00:31:03,592 --> 00:31:07,396
<i>Emergency
departure in 60 seconds.</i>

356
00:31:07,529 --> 00:31:09,432
Jackie! What are you doing?

357
00:31:13,935 --> 00:31:15,171
Don't do this!

358
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:32,281
<i>Full integrity restored.</i>

359
00:32:32,414 --> 00:32:34,483
<i>Systems nominal.</i>

360
00:32:52,536 --> 00:32:54,771
It was almost
just the two of us.

361
00:32:56,905 --> 00:32:59,342
You'd have loved that,
wouldn't you?

362
00:33:03,378 --> 00:33:04,948
Someday...

363
00:33:06,715 --> 00:33:08,785
there will be only one.

364
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,391
And what are you gonna do,
John...

365
00:33:14,523 --> 00:33:17,394
when you're the last man
left alive?

366
00:34:07,742 --> 00:34:10,146
I... I, uh...

367
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:13,648
I think you're very grounded.

368
00:34:13,782 --> 00:34:16,885
No, you haven't aged
a day in five years.

369
00:34:17,018 --> 00:34:18,655
I think it's wonderful.

370
00:34:18,789 --> 00:34:21,389
I don't know.

371
00:34:23,425 --> 00:34:24,425
That's really funny.

372
00:34:24,525 --> 00:34:25,896
Who are you talking to?

373
00:34:27,762 --> 00:34:30,599
Hello, John. How are you?

374
00:34:30,733 --> 00:34:33,202
Do you know what they put
in these things?

375
00:34:33,335 --> 00:34:35,539
Lotus root from Uranus.

376
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:37,471
I don't believe I can eat
much more of this.

377
00:34:37,574 --> 00:34:39,442
- Where's Jackie?
- I don't know.

378
00:34:39,574 --> 00:34:41,577
Funny though, isn't it?

379
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:46,215
How the two of you have
slowly drifted apart

380
00:34:46,347 --> 00:34:48,650
at a time like this...

381
00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:51,822
when you most need
each other?

382
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:55,559
Isn't that funny?
Don't go, John.

383
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:10,740
<i>Crazy.</i>

384
00:35:10,873 --> 00:35:12,608
<i>How tall are you?</i>

385
00:35:18,947 --> 00:35:21,483
<i>You aced it.
Good girl.</i>

386
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:34,030
How could we leave them?

387
00:35:35,664 --> 00:35:37,900
Why was this place
so much more important?

388
00:35:38,034 --> 00:35:40,771
<i>I miss you, too.</i>

389
00:35:43,672 --> 00:35:45,809
Did you need something?

390
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:49,179
You said abandoning Station Two
would save Pangea.

391
00:35:53,181 --> 00:35:54,181
Oxygen.

392
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,585
Pangea uses our O2

393
00:35:55,717 --> 00:35:57,452
to course correct,
to keep us in orbit.

394
00:35:57,588 --> 00:35:58,887
But when we lost a power cell,

395
00:35:59,021 --> 00:36:01,557
Pangea was no longer able
to replenish the oxygen

396
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:02,768
as quickly as we needed it.

397
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,025
- We're suffocating.
- Yes.

398
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:07,764
So if we want breathable air
in Station One,

399
00:36:07,896 --> 00:36:10,132
we need to separate
from Station Two.

400
00:36:10,266 --> 00:36:11,599
We need to blow the bridge.

401
00:36:11,733 --> 00:36:14,603
- It will destroy this place.
- No, we seal the bridge.

402
00:36:14,737 --> 00:36:16,373
We do a controlled explosion,

403
00:36:16,505 --> 00:36:18,340
just enough to blow
a hole in the hull.

404
00:36:18,474 --> 00:36:22,778
And our gravitational rotation
should take care of the rest.

405
00:36:22,911 --> 00:36:24,213
It'll knock us out of orbit,

406
00:36:24,347 --> 00:36:27,650
but what else can we do?

407
00:36:27,782 --> 00:36:29,150
Mm. I should mention.

408
00:36:29,284 --> 00:36:32,054
It is possible that we all die...

409
00:36:34,456 --> 00:36:36,257
...into emptiness.

410
00:36:36,391 --> 00:36:37,391
So...

411
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,731
Richard should have a say.

412
00:36:50,405 --> 00:36:52,208
I'm sorry.

413
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:57,514
You guys put your trust
in me and I failed you.

414
00:36:59,047 --> 00:37:01,784
I'm sorry I couldn't
let you leave.

415
00:37:06,554 --> 00:37:08,525
It's over.

416
00:37:11,626 --> 00:37:13,530
You don't have
to forgive me.

417
00:37:14,963 --> 00:37:16,965
But if we're gonna do
what you're suggesting,

418
00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:19,737
blow up the station
to try to save ourselves...

419
00:37:24,706 --> 00:37:28,610
Jackie, I need you
to get better.

420
00:37:41,123 --> 00:37:42,626
I don't know if John told you

421
00:37:42,757 --> 00:37:44,659
that I came up with a plan

422
00:37:44,793 --> 00:37:47,231
to separate Pangea,

423
00:37:47,362 --> 00:37:50,331
which is pretty flaping clever.

424
00:37:50,465 --> 00:37:52,635
You got any kings?

425
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:54,367
I mean, it could destroy
both stations,

426
00:37:54,467 --> 00:37:56,505
so if you have any objections,
you should say so.

427
00:37:56,639 --> 00:37:59,943
What is it exactly that the
two of you hope to accomplish?

428
00:38:00,074 --> 00:38:01,913
Well, we need to separate
from Station Two...

429
00:38:02,012 --> 00:38:03,371
To conserve energy,
I understand.

430
00:38:04,313 --> 00:38:05,313
But why?

431
00:38:05,413 --> 00:38:06,681
The sooner we secure Pangea,

432
00:38:06,815 --> 00:38:08,813
the sooner we can focus
on getting back to Earth.

433
00:38:08,914 --> 00:38:12,222
So you actually still believe
that by some miracle

434
00:38:12,353 --> 00:38:13,655
your little girl survived

435
00:38:13,789 --> 00:38:16,190
while billions of others
were wiped out.

436
00:38:16,324 --> 00:38:18,159
Is that it?

437
00:38:18,293 --> 00:38:22,132
Do you know what
the first stage of grief is?

438
00:38:22,264 --> 00:38:23,264
It's shock.

439
00:38:23,364 --> 00:38:25,135
Prevents us from being
overwhelmed

440
00:38:25,266 --> 00:38:26,266
by our emotions.

441
00:38:26,365 --> 00:38:28,103
John is running around,
busying himself,

442
00:38:28,237 --> 00:38:30,514
being a good, little captain.
He's gonna protect us all.

443
00:38:30,614 --> 00:38:32,708
You have Jenny.
You're gonna go and find her.

444
00:38:32,842 --> 00:38:34,143
But when the shock goes away,

445
00:38:34,275 --> 00:38:37,112
and then the pain
rises up inside you,

446
00:38:37,246 --> 00:38:39,615
that if you can somehow beat
the darkness

447
00:38:39,748 --> 00:38:43,085
and hope rises again,

448
00:38:43,219 --> 00:38:45,289
and this turning,

449
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,389
which we're not gonna get,

450
00:38:47,523 --> 00:38:48,858
the turning, are we?

451
00:38:48,992 --> 00:38:52,661
You see, we didn't
just lose some pet.

452
00:38:52,795 --> 00:38:54,829
We woke up one morning,

453
00:38:54,963 --> 00:38:58,563
and that happened.

454
00:38:59,702 --> 00:39:02,438
So while you secure
our survival,

455
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:06,275
I want you to ask yourself,
is it a life really worth living?

456
00:39:06,407 --> 00:39:07,643
The last of our kind

457
00:39:07,777 --> 00:39:10,512
floating around
meaninglessly in space?

458
00:39:10,646 --> 00:39:12,005
'Cause it doesn't get
any better.

459
00:39:12,105 --> 00:39:13,302
It's only going to
get worse.

460
00:39:13,402 --> 00:39:15,251
You're scared of
a little shaking hand.

461
00:39:15,385 --> 00:39:17,521
What do you think happens
to our minds

462
00:39:17,652 --> 00:39:20,356
when you realize there isn't
going to be a happy ending?

463
00:39:20,489 --> 00:39:24,226
'Cause you realize that you're
never going to see a sunrise again.

464
00:39:26,295 --> 00:39:28,731
Never dance
with your loved one again.

465
00:39:30,097 --> 00:39:34,503
What will happen
when our minds go?

466
00:39:41,643 --> 00:39:44,681
You got any twos?

467
00:39:58,126 --> 00:40:00,128
You need to do something
about Richard.

468
00:40:08,472 --> 00:40:13,010
Richard, whatever this is,
keep it to yourself.

469
00:40:13,842 --> 00:40:16,277
You're a doctor.
Act like one.

470
00:40:16,411 --> 00:40:18,748
How's your mind, John?

471
00:40:20,782 --> 00:40:22,985
Are you seeing things yet?

472
00:40:24,853 --> 00:40:25,853
I am.

473
00:40:27,623 --> 00:40:29,391
I saw my wife this morning.

474
00:40:29,523 --> 00:40:32,061
Just as clear as you're
standing there right now.

475
00:40:32,195 --> 00:40:33,864
It'll pass.

476
00:40:39,434 --> 00:40:40,969
I don't want it to pass.

477
00:40:41,103 --> 00:40:44,405
Richard, if you're seeing
your wife,

478
00:40:44,539 --> 00:40:47,143
you know better than anyone
something's wrong.

479
00:40:55,083 --> 00:40:57,085
Do you know
what she said to me?

480
00:41:04,659 --> 00:41:06,496
"Come home."

481
00:41:13,702 --> 00:41:16,405
"Come home," John.

482
00:41:16,539 --> 00:41:18,340
"Come home."

483
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,016
Pangea, locate Jackie.

484
00:42:00,148 --> 00:42:02,518
<i>Located. Docking Bay.</i>

485
00:42:03,885 --> 00:42:06,322
- I thought you left.
- Richard went outside.

486
00:42:10,793 --> 00:42:12,862
Richard, can you hear me?
Copy.

487
00:42:13,896 --> 00:42:16,032
Richard, ROB's coming to
get you.

488
00:42:16,164 --> 00:42:17,561
Richard, respond,
that's an order.

489
00:42:17,661 --> 00:42:19,235
<i>Leave it alone, John.</i>

490
00:42:19,367 --> 00:42:21,570
- What are you doing?
- I'll give you one guess.

491
00:42:21,704 --> 00:42:25,742
No, no, you're gonna let Jackie
bring you back, you understand?

492
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:27,041
And why would I do that?

493
00:42:27,175 --> 00:42:28,574
<i>Because you're gonna die,
Richard.</i>

494
00:42:28,673 --> 00:42:31,045
We were always
going to die, John.

495
00:42:31,179 --> 00:42:33,315
Every single one of us.

496
00:42:33,449 --> 00:42:35,407
And I know that's what
you were afraid of, John.

497
00:42:35,507 --> 00:42:37,184
That's why you
won't let Jackie go

498
00:42:37,318 --> 00:42:39,487
<i>'cause you don't want
to be alone.</i>

499
00:42:39,621 --> 00:42:42,157
None of us wanted to be alone.

500
00:42:42,291 --> 00:42:45,027
I'm gonna show you now there's
nothing to be afraid of.

501
00:42:45,159 --> 00:42:46,862
We just go home, John.

502
00:42:46,994 --> 00:42:49,195
<i>We go home.</i>

503
00:42:49,498 --> 00:42:52,233
Oh, my God, it's so...

504
00:42:52,367 --> 00:42:54,003
It's so...

505
00:43:02,378 --> 00:43:04,248
It's so empty.

506
00:43:07,282 --> 00:43:08,983
Richard, can you hear me?
Copy.

507
00:43:09,117 --> 00:43:10,686
<i>John, do you copy?</i>

508
00:43:10,818 --> 00:43:12,954
- <i>Caution, return to Pangea.</i>
- John, do you copy?

509
00:43:13,088 --> 00:43:14,327
Richard, I can hear you.
Copy.

510
00:43:14,427 --> 00:43:15,791
- Jackie.
- <i>Richard.</i>

511
00:43:15,925 --> 00:43:17,403
- <i>Grab onto ROB!</i>
- We're losing him.

512
00:43:17,503 --> 00:43:18,659
<i>Can you hear me, Jackie?</i>

513
00:43:18,793 --> 00:43:20,896
John? John?

514
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:23,400
Richard, calm down.
You're moving out of range.

515
00:43:23,532 --> 00:43:25,610
- <i>Approaching point of no return.</i>
- <i>Oh, John. John.</i>

516
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:27,202
<i>Return to Pangea immediately.</i>

517
00:43:27,335 --> 00:43:29,704
- John!
- Richard, grab onto ROB.

518
00:43:32,974 --> 00:43:35,411
- <i>Danger, range exceeded.</i>
- John!

519
00:43:35,543 --> 00:43:38,514
- <i>Danger! Range exceeded.</i>
- Help me!

520
00:43:41,184 --> 00:43:42,652
Richard.

521
00:43:44,588 --> 00:43:46,289
Richard? Richard.

522
00:43:46,422 --> 00:43:49,592
- <i>Unable to locate Dr. Valin.</i>
- Richard?

523
00:44:20,255 --> 00:44:21,856
<i>Scan interrupted.</i>

524
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:24,193
<i>Unknown object located.</i>

525
00:44:37,072 --> 00:44:39,242
<i>Object located.</i>

526
00:44:45,114 --> 00:44:46,615
I found you.

527
00:45:02,164 --> 00:45:04,199
There's gotta be
a better way.

528
00:45:04,333 --> 00:45:06,001
And Richard showed it to us.

529
00:45:07,735 --> 00:45:08,905
Did you hear him?

530
00:45:09,036 --> 00:45:11,206
I can't do that.

531
00:45:12,775 --> 00:45:14,344
He's right, John.

532
00:45:15,110 --> 00:45:17,179
It's time to let go.

533
00:45:21,117 --> 00:45:22,751
We just fall asleep?

534
00:45:32,893 --> 00:45:34,730
We won't feel a thing.

535
00:45:49,077 --> 00:45:50,311
Oh, my God.

536
00:46:02,992 --> 00:46:05,561
- What do we do?
- It's in a spin.
There's nothing we can do.

537
00:46:05,693 --> 00:46:08,530
What? There could
be survivors.

538
00:46:08,664 --> 00:46:12,735
- No one's piloting the shuttle.
- Well, then we use it as an escape pod.

539
00:46:12,867 --> 00:46:16,237
This is Pangea.
Who's approaching? Please respond.

540
00:46:17,672 --> 00:46:20,175
This is Pangea.
Please respond.

541
00:46:24,045 --> 00:46:27,114
What if someone is on board?
We don't know what state they're in.

542
00:46:27,248 --> 00:46:29,284
I'm willing
to take that risk.

543
00:46:30,853 --> 00:46:32,621
Get on COMM.

544
00:46:37,391 --> 00:46:38,994
500 meters and closing.

545
00:46:39,128 --> 00:46:41,405
<i>You only have a few
moments to seal the hatch behind you</i>

546
00:46:41,505 --> 00:46:42,731
<i>before you risk exposure.</i>

547
00:46:44,099 --> 00:46:46,202
Okay. Okay.

548
00:46:47,034 --> 00:46:48,472
Opening emergency hatch.

549
00:46:50,106 --> 00:46:52,007
Do you hear that?

550
00:46:52,141 --> 00:46:53,409
<i>To the Apollo shuttle,</i>

551
00:46:53,541 --> 00:46:55,643
<i>we are at your
emergency hatch, respond.</i>

552
00:46:58,246 --> 00:47:00,117
All right, I'm going in.

553
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:21,068
There's someone here.

554
00:47:21,202 --> 00:47:23,271
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

555
00:47:24,106 --> 00:47:26,074
It looks like
two crewmembers.

556
00:47:26,208 --> 00:47:29,443
Unresponsive,
but I think they're alive.

557
00:47:29,577 --> 00:47:32,547
<i>John, we're not alone.</i>

558
00:47:36,416 --> 00:47:39,155
Jackie. Secure Pangea.

559
00:47:48,896 --> 00:47:50,063
How are they?

560
00:47:50,197 --> 00:47:53,235
Jaundice,
malnourishment.

561
00:47:55,237 --> 00:47:57,373
- Anything I can do?
- I don't know.

562
00:47:58,806 --> 00:48:00,376
I'm not a doctor.

563
00:48:03,713 --> 00:48:05,780
If only Richard
had waited.

564
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:10,286
Of course, we'll find you
something more permanent,

565
00:48:10,418 --> 00:48:12,454
but for now,
the lounge is yours.

566
00:48:18,092 --> 00:48:20,195
- Hi. John...
- John Raymond Laine,

567
00:48:20,327 --> 00:48:22,498
captain of Pangea, 92477.

568
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:24,532
Our distress call.
You heard it.

569
00:48:24,666 --> 00:48:27,036
- This is Diane.
- Nice to meet you.

570
00:48:27,168 --> 00:48:29,304
Ah, yes, I'm sorry.

571
00:48:29,436 --> 00:48:30,871
Captain Diane Ures.

572
00:48:31,005 --> 00:48:32,606
- How are your men?
- Resting.

573
00:48:32,742 --> 00:48:34,641
Captain Ures,
not to be rude, but I was...

574
00:48:34,775 --> 00:48:36,978
You would like to hear
what happened to us.

575
00:48:39,447 --> 00:48:42,650
We were two months
into preparation on ISS,

576
00:48:42,784 --> 00:48:44,753
readying for our voyage
to Europa.

577
00:48:44,887 --> 00:48:47,356
- Who were the crew?
- Two Americans and ourselves.

578
00:48:47,489 --> 00:48:49,059
Two hours before it happened,

579
00:48:49,190 --> 00:48:51,525
we lost contact
with Home and...

580
00:48:51,659 --> 00:48:53,295
we were forced to make
another pass

581
00:48:53,427 --> 00:48:55,597
before we could attempt
contact again.

582
00:48:56,664 --> 00:49:00,702
Then, an hour
before the event,

583
00:49:00,835 --> 00:49:02,804
- we received transmission.
- From who?

584
00:49:02,938 --> 00:49:06,643
It was only static.
Then we saw it.

585
00:49:11,414 --> 00:49:12,681
We were not as far as you,

586
00:49:12,813 --> 00:49:17,052
so the initial waves damaged
ISS beyond salvage.

587
00:49:17,184 --> 00:49:19,786
But that was three months ago.
How did you make it this far?

588
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,356
Luck. The Americans
had died from injuries

589
00:49:22,492 --> 00:49:23,657
sustained in the blast.

590
00:49:23,791 --> 00:49:25,226
I am not happy
that they died,

591
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:27,530
but we would not have
survived...

592
00:49:27,664 --> 00:49:30,197
had they been there
to share resources.

593
00:49:30,331 --> 00:49:31,800
- What else?
- That's it.

594
00:49:31,934 --> 00:49:35,603
We exhausted supplies
and we set out for Pangea.

595
00:49:35,737 --> 00:49:37,536
What would you have done
if we weren't here?

596
00:49:37,635 --> 00:49:39,034
Our shuttle
would not have made it

597
00:49:39,134 --> 00:49:40,340
to Europa without repairs,

598
00:49:40,474 --> 00:49:42,010
but we would have tried.

599
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:45,280
But now we can fix the shuttle
and go, all of us.

600
00:49:45,414 --> 00:49:48,050
Europa has not
had a crew in 18 months,

601
00:49:48,184 --> 00:49:49,818
but she can be lived on.

602
00:49:49,952 --> 00:49:51,420
Am I wrong?

603
00:49:52,954 --> 00:49:54,190
Is Europa gone, too?

604
00:49:54,322 --> 00:49:56,291
Not as far as we can tell.

605
00:49:57,391 --> 00:49:58,893
Do you know what happened?

606
00:50:00,929 --> 00:50:04,032
No. I was hoping
that you would.

607
00:50:43,505 --> 00:50:45,974
Hello? Hello?

608
00:50:47,407 --> 00:50:49,077
Is anyone there?

609
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:50,378
Anyone?

610
00:50:50,512 --> 00:50:52,780
I've repaired
the shuttle.

611
00:50:52,914 --> 00:50:54,949
I'm preparing to go
to Station Two.

612
00:50:56,818 --> 00:51:00,688
If anyone can hear me,
please say something.

613
00:51:03,391 --> 00:51:04,791
Anyone?

614
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:14,101
Hello?

615
00:51:15,938 --> 00:51:16,972
Hello!

616
00:51:18,672 --> 00:51:20,041
Can you hear me?

617
00:51:20,175 --> 00:51:23,478
<i>We were always
going to die, John,</i>

618
00:51:23,612 --> 00:51:26,014
<i>every single one of us.</i>

619
00:51:26,148 --> 00:51:28,050
<i>So let's go home, John.</i>

620
00:51:28,184 --> 00:51:31,186
I'm too close.
I'm too close.

621
00:51:31,318 --> 00:51:33,389
Leave me alone.

622
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,628
<i>I know it's not your fault,</i>

623
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:42,597
<i>but couldn't you
have done something?</i>

624
00:51:42,731 --> 00:51:45,800
<i>Wake up.
We're all that's left.</i>

625
00:51:55,476 --> 00:51:57,512
<i>It's time to let go, John.</i>

626
00:52:04,619 --> 00:52:07,757
Dr. Thomas Dahan
and Vincent Bernard,

627
00:52:07,889 --> 00:52:09,489
this is Captain John Laine,

628
00:52:09,623 --> 00:52:12,427
engineer Jackie Miller,
our saviors.

629
00:52:12,561 --> 00:52:13,561
Please, sit.

630
00:52:13,661 --> 00:52:15,731
- Hey.
- Hi.

631
00:52:17,766 --> 00:52:20,735
When I awoke,
I was sure I was in heaven.

632
00:52:20,869 --> 00:52:22,938
Well, even that is run
by Americans.

633
00:52:23,070 --> 00:52:24,972
You still have solids.

634
00:52:26,507 --> 00:52:28,443
- How?
- Excuse his excitement.

635
00:52:28,577 --> 00:52:30,478
We have been on a strict diet
of supplements.

636
00:52:30,612 --> 00:52:32,780
The Pangea crew serves
ten-year terms.

637
00:52:32,914 --> 00:52:35,682
So in the event of a delay
with re-supply,

638
00:52:35,818 --> 00:52:38,019
we need to remain fully
functional at all times.

639
00:52:38,152 --> 00:52:40,422
Then you are
completely self-sufficient?

640
00:52:40,554 --> 00:52:41,989
We sustained some damage,
but...

641
00:52:42,123 --> 00:52:43,961
You will be last in line
to the pearly gates.

642
00:52:44,061 --> 00:52:45,228
Could we have a tour?

643
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:47,398
I always wished to marvel
at Pangea's engineering.

644
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:49,574
That would be nice.
But first, let's enjoy the meal

645
00:52:49,675 --> 00:52:52,135
that our hosts
have prepared for us.

646
00:52:53,168 --> 00:52:54,969
And thank you
for opening your doors.

647
00:52:55,103 --> 00:52:59,407
While the Lounge
is crucial to our sanity,

648
00:52:59,541 --> 00:53:02,045
Control keeps us alive.

649
00:53:02,177 --> 00:53:03,878
So treat it as such.

650
00:53:04,012 --> 00:53:07,250
What about Life Support,
Engineering Bay?

651
00:53:07,382 --> 00:53:08,884
Pangea's much larger, no?

652
00:53:09,016 --> 00:53:12,119
We're rerouting all resources
to Station One.

653
00:53:12,253 --> 00:53:14,088
In a few days, we separate.

654
00:53:14,222 --> 00:53:15,523
Very clever, Miss Miller.

655
00:53:15,657 --> 00:53:17,695
How long can you survive
with only half a station?

656
00:53:17,795 --> 00:53:20,596
Food, oxygen,
you have enough?

657
00:53:20,728 --> 00:53:22,327
There's no reason
to hide your concern.

658
00:53:22,427 --> 00:53:24,800
You're thinking what you
rightfully should be thinking.

659
00:53:24,934 --> 00:53:27,168
Your calculations on how long
life support will last

660
00:53:27,302 --> 00:53:29,539
are based on the premise
that it's just the two of you.

661
00:53:29,639 --> 00:53:32,407
And now we are here,
so the question is now...

662
00:53:32,539 --> 00:53:34,742
how long can we five survive?

663
00:53:35,976 --> 00:53:38,579
- Long enough to fix your shuttle.
- What do you mean?

664
00:53:38,713 --> 00:53:41,083
Well, if we continue
to live the way we are now,

665
00:53:41,215 --> 00:53:43,684
it'd be very difficult
to maintain sustainability

666
00:53:43,818 --> 00:53:45,538
for the time needed
to make these repairs,

667
00:53:45,655 --> 00:53:48,222
but, if we go down
from three meals a day to one,

668
00:53:48,356 --> 00:53:51,893
if we redirect the remaining
oxygen to areas of the ship

669
00:53:52,025 --> 00:53:56,963
that are only necessary,
we can make it to Europa.

670
00:53:57,097 --> 00:53:59,367
- You sure that'll work?
- If we ration, yeah.

671
00:53:59,501 --> 00:54:00,735
That's amazing.

672
00:54:00,869 --> 00:54:02,972
We must celebrate, huh?

673
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:07,842
Let's celebrate.

674
00:54:16,284 --> 00:54:17,385
I'm the best!

675
00:55:11,472 --> 00:55:12,806
I'm yelling stop, stop,

676
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:15,309
and they just send me
around 1g, 2g, 9g.

677
00:55:15,443 --> 00:55:17,679
I couldn't hold it.
There was feces everywhere.

678
00:55:20,215 --> 00:55:21,818
How have you managed
this time?

679
00:55:21,949 --> 00:55:25,418
The role of captain,
even when it means nothing?

680
00:55:25,552 --> 00:55:27,889
It's like they're my children.

681
00:55:28,722 --> 00:55:29,922
<i>Salut!</i>

682
00:55:36,264 --> 00:55:37,800
Sweet dreams.

683
00:55:38,498 --> 00:55:39,568
I think it is safe to say

684
00:55:39,702 --> 00:55:41,936
that you are
the luckiest man alive.

685
00:55:45,172 --> 00:55:47,009
You think anyone
could have survived that?

686
00:55:47,141 --> 00:55:50,213
Oh, absolutely. People only think
that you can't breathe in space.

687
00:55:50,344 --> 00:55:52,280
We see it there,

688
00:55:52,414 --> 00:55:54,682
and against everything
that we know to be true,

689
00:55:54,815 --> 00:55:56,117
we still have hope.

690
00:55:56,251 --> 00:56:01,123
I would have once said
that that is impossible.

691
00:56:01,255 --> 00:56:03,893
But to survive?

692
00:56:04,025 --> 00:56:05,025
No.

693
00:56:06,327 --> 00:56:07,327
Not possible.

694
00:56:07,425 --> 00:56:08,764
You do know what happened.

695
00:56:12,599 --> 00:56:14,199
Tell me.

696
00:56:36,492 --> 00:56:39,427
<i>Projected life
support for two personnel...</i>

697
00:56:39,559 --> 00:56:41,960
<i>three years.</i>

698
00:56:42,128 --> 00:56:45,434
<i>Projected life support
for five personnel...</i>

699
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:47,101
<i>one month.</i>

700
00:56:51,039 --> 00:56:52,306
<i>Five personnel...</i>

701
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:55,876
<i>one daily meal ration,
one month.</i>

702
00:57:30,411 --> 00:57:32,012
- That's not your card.
- No.

703
00:57:32,146 --> 00:57:34,047
- That wasn't it?
- Uh-huh. No.

704
00:57:34,181 --> 00:57:35,349
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.

705
00:57:35,483 --> 00:57:36,652
<i>Bonjour!</i>

706
00:57:36,784 --> 00:57:38,552
Was this your card?

707
00:57:40,621 --> 00:57:42,992
Sorry for taking
your commons.

708
00:57:44,358 --> 00:57:46,260
Please join us.
What should we play?

709
00:57:46,393 --> 00:57:48,862
This is your home,
you pick the game.

710
00:57:48,996 --> 00:57:50,731
Do you know Go Fish?

711
00:57:54,568 --> 00:57:55,637
Gin it is!

712
00:57:55,771 --> 00:57:56,809
Let me ask you a question,

713
00:57:56,909 --> 00:57:58,146
one I'm sure you
ask yourself.

714
00:57:58,246 --> 00:57:59,875
We can't explain
the shock wave.

715
00:58:00,007 --> 00:58:01,242
We've tried.

716
00:58:01,376 --> 00:58:03,277
But the fact that it hit
you so far away means

717
00:58:03,411 --> 00:58:05,967
whatever happened is something
that we never knew could happen.

718
00:58:06,068 --> 00:58:08,518
- So, what was it?
- Oh, uh...

719
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:12,119
Vincent believes it was
a nuclear comet, idiot.

720
00:58:12,253 --> 00:58:14,521
And Thomas,
grand as it may be,

721
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:15,958
thinks it was CERN.

722
00:58:16,090 --> 00:58:18,393
And in recreating
their tiny big bangs,

723
00:58:18,527 --> 00:58:20,295
they created a very big one.

724
00:58:20,427 --> 00:58:23,231
What do you
think caused all this?

725
00:58:24,565 --> 00:58:26,333
<i>Jackie. Quarters, please.</i>

726
00:58:28,003 --> 00:58:29,972
I'm so sorry.
Excuse me.

727
00:58:30,103 --> 00:58:33,340
I expect an answer, huh? On your return.

728
00:58:38,679 --> 00:58:41,583
What is this? Jackie!

729
00:58:49,056 --> 00:58:50,724
Do you see what it says?

730
00:58:50,858 --> 00:58:54,762
With the three of them here,
we all die by the end of the month.

731
00:58:54,896 --> 00:58:56,257
You said you
could repair Pangea.

732
00:58:56,364 --> 00:58:58,083
I haven't even separated
the stations yet.

733
00:58:58,182 --> 00:58:59,768
If it we're only us two,
I could.

734
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:02,737
But introducing three new
people, Pangea can't handle it.

735
00:59:02,871 --> 00:59:04,630
We're losing O2 faster
than we can make it.

736
00:59:04,730 --> 00:59:06,706
So you'll leave?
That's not even your ship.

737
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:09,710
They'll never make it to Europa,
and we don't have time to repair it.

738
00:59:09,844 --> 00:59:14,349
But it could take us home.

739
00:59:15,617 --> 00:59:17,117
No. You're not going.

740
00:59:17,251 --> 00:59:20,222
- You're no longer my captain.
- Yes, I am!

741
00:59:20,356 --> 00:59:23,289
Every time I close my eyes, I see Jenny.
That's all I think about.

742
00:59:23,425 --> 00:59:26,327
You tell me to move on, to let it
go, and then they show up?

743
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:28,730
If they thought they were
alone, they would have died.

744
00:59:28,862 --> 00:59:32,501
But they didn't and they kept
trying and they found us.

745
00:59:32,632 --> 00:59:34,469
Don't you see, John?

746
00:59:34,603 --> 00:59:37,137
Jenny could still be alive.

747
00:59:41,943 --> 00:59:43,143
Captain Ures

748
00:59:43,277 --> 00:59:44,675
to Miss Miller's quarters,
please.

749
00:59:44,775 --> 00:59:46,947
John, what are you doing?
Why are you calling her?

750
00:59:47,081 --> 00:59:49,650
This has nothing
to do with her.

751
00:59:49,784 --> 00:59:50,784
John.

752
00:59:54,856 --> 00:59:56,992
Captain Laine.

753
00:59:57,123 --> 01:00:00,128
Diane, can you tell Miss Miller
what you told me last night, please?

754
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:02,657
- Diane, you don't have...
- I don't think that's my place.

755
01:00:02,757 --> 01:00:03,757
Now, Diane!

756
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:07,300
Please.

757
01:00:14,443 --> 01:00:18,280
Mark, Jean? Could you see if wiring
may have shorted on your end?

758
01:00:18,414 --> 01:00:20,947
<i>That's a negative.
Wiring's fine.</i>

759
01:00:21,081 --> 01:00:23,385
Ah, shooot. Okay.

760
01:00:24,885 --> 01:00:28,389
Oh! I think
I can do something.

761
01:00:32,726 --> 01:00:33,726
Mark!

762
01:00:33,994 --> 01:00:34,994
Jean?

763
01:00:41,302 --> 01:00:43,204
Houston, this is ISS.

764
01:00:43,338 --> 01:00:45,606
Something is happening
to Earth. Do you copy?

765
01:00:48,476 --> 01:00:50,346
This is ISS.
What is happening?

766
01:00:50,478 --> 01:00:52,715
- <i>Oh, my God, what have we done?</i>
- What are you saying?

767
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:53,981
<i>Do not return.
I repeat.</i>

768
01:00:54,114 --> 01:00:55,617
- What did you do?
- <i>Do not return.</i>

769
01:00:55,751 --> 01:00:57,885
<i>Go to Europa.</i>

770
01:01:29,751 --> 01:01:31,952
That's all I heard.

771
01:01:32,085 --> 01:01:34,389
"Go to Europa."

772
01:02:26,739 --> 01:02:28,309
How is it you two met?

773
01:02:30,177 --> 01:02:32,248
- Flight school.
- Flight school.

774
01:02:33,313 --> 01:02:35,648
And here you are,
a companion

775
01:02:35,782 --> 01:02:38,052
at the end of the world.

776
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:42,155
You have much work to do
if you are to save mankind.

777
01:02:43,556 --> 01:02:47,427
Thomas told me about
your friend, Lisa.

778
01:02:47,561 --> 01:02:50,530
Sad. But would we consider
her the lucky one?

779
01:02:50,664 --> 01:02:52,900
I don't think this is
appropriate dinner conversation.

780
01:02:53,034 --> 01:02:55,336
Shall I clear the table?

781
01:02:56,838 --> 01:03:00,175
Really, I would consider
all of those who died lucky.

782
01:03:00,309 --> 01:03:02,643
They know nothing
of what happened.

783
01:03:02,777 --> 01:03:03,878
Sure, they know something,

784
01:03:04,010 --> 01:03:07,648
but who would believe
it would be our extinction.

785
01:03:07,782 --> 01:03:10,251
No one agrees?

786
01:03:10,385 --> 01:03:12,184
I mean...

787
01:03:13,521 --> 01:03:16,990
I don't consider Lisa,
or anyone else, lucky.

788
01:03:17,123 --> 01:03:18,724
Were we?

789
01:03:19,927 --> 01:03:21,730
Because we survived?

790
01:03:26,367 --> 01:03:28,436
Are you afraid to die,
Captain Laine?

791
01:03:30,637 --> 01:03:31,637
I am.

792
01:03:32,373 --> 01:03:34,208
I am, I'm terrified.

793
01:03:34,342 --> 01:03:36,644
He lied to us!

794
01:03:52,427 --> 01:03:55,530
Miss Miller, can I speak
with John alone?

795
01:04:08,708 --> 01:04:12,045
Don't listen to them.
Listen to me.

796
01:04:12,179 --> 01:04:14,380
We survive.

797
01:04:18,385 --> 01:04:20,353
Why would you review
our life support?

798
01:04:20,487 --> 01:04:21,922
Because I knew
you were lying.

799
01:04:22,056 --> 01:04:24,291
We were wrong!
We weren't lying.

800
01:04:24,425 --> 01:04:26,128
There's no chance
at fixing the shuttle?

801
01:04:26,260 --> 01:04:28,530
Nothing we can do
to prolong our time?

802
01:04:31,998 --> 01:04:33,534
We were so close.

803
01:04:35,869 --> 01:04:38,739
She understood.
They'll be fine.

804
01:04:38,871 --> 01:04:41,309
Vincent was not fine.

805
01:04:41,443 --> 01:04:43,344
Tomorrow we separate Pangea.

806
01:04:43,476 --> 01:04:45,612
And whatever happens
after that...

807
01:04:46,646 --> 01:04:48,449
we figure it out together.

808
01:04:55,956 --> 01:04:57,525
Vincent, please.

809
01:05:02,963 --> 01:05:03,963
Vincent?

810
01:05:06,501 --> 01:05:07,936
No, Diane is right.

811
01:05:09,704 --> 01:05:11,273
This is wrong.

812
01:05:11,405 --> 01:05:12,572
Them or us.

813
01:05:12,706 --> 01:05:15,376
Vincent, please.
Not again.

814
01:05:15,510 --> 01:05:18,914
Them or us!
Choose.

815
01:05:19,047 --> 01:05:20,682
What do you mean, not again?

816
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:22,550
Huh?

817
01:05:22,648 --> 01:05:23,818
Mark and Jean? No!

818
01:05:23,952 --> 01:05:25,710
- Mark and Jean?
- I haven't done anything.

819
01:05:25,809 --> 01:05:27,387
You told me
they poisoned themselves.

820
01:05:27,521 --> 01:05:28,757
You lied to me?

821
01:05:30,257 --> 01:05:32,793
- You murdered them?
- I saved us.

822
01:05:32,925 --> 01:05:33,927
I will save us again.

823
01:05:43,170 --> 01:05:44,905
Enough. Huh?

824
01:05:45,039 --> 01:05:47,206
No, enough, okay?

825
01:05:49,309 --> 01:05:51,780
Shh-shh-shh...

826
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:01,922
Shh-shh-shh...

827
01:06:34,621 --> 01:06:36,356
Where's Captain Ures?

828
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:41,396
Vincent, I'm sorry
you think we lied.

829
01:06:42,762 --> 01:06:44,632
Jackie, give us a moment?

830
01:06:49,338 --> 01:06:51,505
Okay. You have us.

831
01:06:51,639 --> 01:06:52,940
What do you wanna know?

832
01:06:53,072 --> 01:06:55,510
Miss Miller, please give us
your honest assessment

833
01:06:55,643 --> 01:06:57,677
regarding our life expectancy.

834
01:06:57,811 --> 01:07:00,007
- You know the answer.
- I'd like to hear it from her.

835
01:07:00,108 --> 01:07:02,065
- One month.
- And if there were only two of us?

836
01:07:02,164 --> 01:07:03,842
- I'm not going to answer that.
- Please.

837
01:07:03,943 --> 01:07:05,119
- No.
- What is this?

838
01:07:05,251 --> 01:07:06,588
Where's Diane?

839
01:07:11,425 --> 01:07:12,760
Diane, are you there?

840
01:07:13,460 --> 01:07:15,563
Diane, please respond?

841
01:07:19,666 --> 01:07:21,001
Captain Ures?

842
01:07:26,206 --> 01:07:27,842
Jesus Christ.

843
01:07:32,981 --> 01:07:35,648
- I want you off my ship.
- Where would we go?

844
01:07:35,782 --> 01:07:37,351
No, it's too late for that.

845
01:07:37,485 --> 01:07:39,487
- We could've left you to die.
- And I thank you.

846
01:07:39,619 --> 01:07:42,021
But you can't expect us
to willingly commit suicide

847
01:07:42,155 --> 01:07:44,512
- so you can live out your days alone.
- flaping monsters.

848
01:07:44,612 --> 01:07:46,860
No, no.
This is not some evil scheme.

849
01:07:46,994 --> 01:07:49,797
When you told us we would survive,
do you know how excited I was?

850
01:07:49,931 --> 01:07:52,809
- Because we were wrong, you want to
kill us?
- This is not about you.

851
01:07:52,909 --> 01:07:54,666
I like you very much.
This is about my men.

852
01:07:54,766 --> 01:07:58,172
- What about your captain?
- How could I
live knowing we would die in days

853
01:07:58,306 --> 01:08:00,663
when in return for a horrible
act, I could offer us years.

854
01:08:00,762 --> 01:08:02,510
What would you do?

855
01:08:02,643 --> 01:08:04,010
I let you on board.

856
01:08:04,146 --> 01:08:06,581
- Then you are the better man.
- Goddamn it.

857
01:08:06,713 --> 01:08:08,911
- You can't run Pangea without us.
- We don't want to.

858
01:08:09,010 --> 01:08:10,952
We'll fix our ship and go.
And with you gone,

859
01:08:11,085 --> 01:08:12,920
we will have the time
to do so.

860
01:08:14,188 --> 01:08:15,389
Jesus.

861
01:08:23,529 --> 01:08:26,533
John! All right, down.
Stay down.

862
01:08:26,667 --> 01:08:28,536
You're bleeding.
We need to get to Medical.

863
01:08:28,668 --> 01:08:30,146
Go to Control.
Start the separation.

864
01:08:30,247 --> 01:08:31,324
Get Vincent to Station Two.

865
01:08:39,979 --> 01:08:43,117
<i>Rebooting systems.
Stand by.</i>

866
01:09:21,122 --> 01:09:23,692
I'm right here, you bastard.
Come on.

867
01:10:10,136 --> 01:10:11,538
No, Diane.

868
01:10:50,479 --> 01:10:52,046
John? John?

869
01:10:52,180 --> 01:10:54,716
Wake up!
Wake up!

870
01:10:56,618 --> 01:10:58,520
John, what happened?

871
01:10:58,653 --> 01:11:00,154
Where's Vincent?

872
01:11:02,390 --> 01:11:04,324
Open the door.

873
01:11:04,457 --> 01:11:07,095
<i>Reboot interrupted.</i>

874
01:11:07,226 --> 01:11:09,029
Try again.

875
01:11:09,162 --> 01:11:10,162
That's Vincent.

876
01:11:10,261 --> 01:11:12,332
John. He's going to
blow the bridge.

877
01:11:12,466 --> 01:11:15,903
He doesn't know what he's doing.
You have to stop him.

878
01:11:16,037 --> 01:11:18,672
<i>Accessing
ventilation pilot system now.</i>

879
01:11:18,805 --> 01:11:21,007
Back away
from the computers.

880
01:11:21,141 --> 01:11:22,578
I said, get back!

881
01:11:24,011 --> 01:11:26,529
- I'm not going to die.
- If you don't stop what you're doing,

882
01:11:26,628 --> 01:11:28,185
that's exactly what's
going to happen.

883
01:11:28,286 --> 01:11:29,724
- You're lying.
- Let's ask Jackie.

884
01:11:29,823 --> 01:11:32,118
Do I look like a fool?
Get back!

885
01:11:32,252 --> 01:11:34,154
Jackie, you there?

886
01:11:34,287 --> 01:11:36,604
- I'm here, where are you?
- <i>I'm in Control with Vincent.</i>

887
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:39,020
- <i>What's happening?</i>
- He's turning on the heating system.

888
01:11:39,119 --> 01:11:42,363
- It's asking if we're going to ignite
the pilot.
- Jesus flaping Christ.

889
01:11:42,497 --> 01:11:44,998
- Vincent, are you listening to me?
- He's listening.

890
01:11:45,131 --> 01:11:47,269
<i>Vincent, we never sealed
the vents.</i>

891
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:50,136
<i>If you ignite the pilot,
it won't be controlled as we planned,</i>

892
01:11:50,270 --> 01:11:51,949
<i>and fire will spread
throughout the vents</i>

893
01:11:52,073 --> 01:11:54,208
and Pangea,
and you will kill us all.

894
01:11:55,443 --> 01:11:56,743
Where's Thomas?

895
01:11:57,877 --> 01:11:59,311
<i>Where's Thomas?</i>

896
01:11:59,445 --> 01:12:00,845
Thomas!

897
01:12:01,716 --> 01:12:03,385
Thomas!
Do you hear me?

898
01:12:03,516 --> 01:12:07,154
<i>Thomas is safe,
but he won't be if you don't stop this.</i>

899
01:12:09,789 --> 01:12:11,091
<i>What's he doing?</i>

900
01:12:12,693 --> 01:12:15,029
He's not gonna listen.

901
01:12:15,162 --> 01:12:18,164
- <i>Do you still have the knife?</i>
- Yeah.

902
01:12:19,100 --> 01:12:20,368
Use it...

903
01:12:20,502 --> 01:12:21,936
and shut off the system.

904
01:12:22,069 --> 01:12:23,904
It's either that or he kills us all.
Use it.

905
01:12:24,037 --> 01:12:26,338
Is that what you want?

906
01:12:26,472 --> 01:12:28,310
To get everybody killed?

907
01:12:31,311 --> 01:12:33,247
- You won't let me live.
- Yes, we will.

908
01:12:33,381 --> 01:12:34,649
No, no, not now.

909
01:12:34,783 --> 01:12:36,752
Nobody's going to kill you!

910
01:12:36,885 --> 01:12:40,587
Why would we kill you
if we're all that's left!

911
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:42,657
<i>Earth is gone.</i>

912
01:12:45,091 --> 01:12:46,627
That's why you came here.

913
01:12:46,761 --> 01:12:48,729
<i>None of us want to die,
Vincent.</i>

914
01:12:52,632 --> 01:12:54,668
I was trying to protect us.

915
01:12:56,470 --> 01:12:58,439
I saved us.

916
01:13:00,106 --> 01:13:01,106
<i>John?</i>

917
01:13:09,551 --> 01:13:12,319
John!
flaping talk to me!

918
01:13:13,819 --> 01:13:15,488
- <i>I'm at the computer.</i>
- Okay.

919
01:13:15,622 --> 01:13:17,759
Back out of
the heating system.

920
01:13:17,890 --> 01:13:19,693
<i>Close the vents and open
this flaping door!</i>

921
01:13:19,827 --> 01:13:21,694
<i>Vents secured.</i>

922
01:13:21,828 --> 01:13:23,663
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

923
01:13:23,796 --> 01:13:26,198
- Vents are closed.
- <i>Closing ventilation systems.</i>

924
01:13:26,332 --> 01:13:28,970
- It's too late.
- Shutting down temperature control.

925
01:13:30,770 --> 01:13:32,207
It's too late!

926
01:13:39,979 --> 01:13:41,381
John, what's happening?

927
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:53,092
He's gonna blow the station!

928
01:13:53,225 --> 01:13:55,430
<i>John, you have
to seal the bridge now.</i>

929
01:14:00,033 --> 01:14:01,601
I'm going back
in to seal the bridge.

930
01:14:01,734 --> 01:14:04,503
No, you'll be trapped in Station Two.
He's gonna blow it! Run!

931
01:14:04,637 --> 01:14:06,841
Heading for Station Two.

932
01:14:08,743 --> 01:14:11,342
<i>Error. Error.</i>

933
01:14:12,180 --> 01:14:13,582
You will come to forgive me.

934
01:14:13,713 --> 01:14:16,149
I'm in Station Two,
brace for impact.

935
01:14:17,917 --> 01:14:20,954
<i>Heating system activated.</i>

936
01:14:39,372 --> 01:14:41,774
John, the pilot didn't ignite.
We're okay.

937
01:14:45,444 --> 01:14:46,814
You lied.

938
01:14:46,948 --> 01:14:49,550
<i>Shut down the heating system
and throw Vincent off this ship.</i>

939
01:14:49,681 --> 01:14:51,252
I'm heading your way.

940
01:14:54,954 --> 01:14:57,359
<i>Warning.
Fire detected in Bridge.</i>

941
01:15:00,694 --> 01:15:03,931
- It's ignited.
- Can you get to me?

942
01:15:08,301 --> 01:15:10,838
- I'm trapped!
- Get to Station Two!

943
01:15:48,877 --> 01:15:51,046
Jackie, can you hear me?

944
01:15:52,613 --> 01:15:54,181
Jackie, are you there?

945
01:16:16,002 --> 01:16:19,908
Jackie, can you hear me?
Jackie, are you there?

946
01:16:52,805 --> 01:16:54,507
<i>Decompressing.</i>

947
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:56,944
<i>Warning, recalibrating.</i>

948
01:17:27,073 --> 01:17:28,475
<i>Someday...</i>

949
01:17:30,979 --> 01:17:33,012
<i>there will be only one.</i>

950
01:17:35,515 --> 01:17:38,219
<i>And what are you gonna do,
John...</i>

951
01:17:39,220 --> 01:17:41,355
<i>when you're the last man
left alone?</i>

952
01:17:46,926 --> 01:17:47,926
<i>John.</i>

953
01:17:51,064 --> 01:17:53,333
- <i>John!</i>
- Jackie? Jackie?

954
01:17:53,466 --> 01:17:56,069
<i>God, please, John!
Are you there?</i>

955
01:17:56,203 --> 01:17:57,704
Jackie, I'm here,
where are you?

956
01:17:57,837 --> 01:17:59,756
<i>I locked myself in the pantry.
Did we separate?</i>

957
01:17:59,855 --> 01:18:02,876
- Yeah.
- <i>Am I close? Can you make the jump?</i>

958
01:18:03,010 --> 01:18:04,609
Hang on!

959
01:18:06,579 --> 01:18:08,948
I can't see you.
You're too far.

960
01:18:09,082 --> 01:18:11,653
- How can I get to you?
- <i>The shuttle.</i>

961
01:18:20,092 --> 01:18:22,029
- Oh, damn it!
- <i>What is it? What's wrong?</i>

962
01:18:22,162 --> 01:18:23,930
The explosion.
It damaged the shuttle.

963
01:18:24,064 --> 01:18:25,423
- <i>Can you fix it?</i>
- I don't know.

964
01:18:26,966 --> 01:18:29,737
- Jackie?
- <i>Please, John, you have to find me!</i>

965
01:18:29,868 --> 01:18:31,270
I will. I will.

966
01:18:31,404 --> 01:18:35,141
- <i>Oh, God, John, please!</i>
- Jackie, Jackie, listen to me.

967
01:18:35,274 --> 01:18:38,212
Breathe. Calm down.

968
01:18:38,345 --> 01:18:41,248
I swear I'll get you back,
okay?

969
01:18:41,381 --> 01:18:42,381
Okay?

970
01:18:43,618 --> 01:18:46,287
- Tell me how to fix this thing.
- <i>Okay. What was damaged?</i>

971
01:18:46,418 --> 01:18:48,654
Looks like the
ignition board is fried.

972
01:18:49,789 --> 01:18:52,059
<i>Okay. Okay. Can you see...</i>

973
01:18:52,193 --> 01:18:54,662
Can I see what? Jackie?

974
01:18:55,895 --> 01:18:57,230
Jackie!

975
01:18:57,930 --> 01:18:59,331
Jackie!

976
01:19:08,176 --> 01:19:10,712
<i>Abandon research directive.</i>

977
01:19:10,845 --> 01:19:13,047
<i>Scanning for Station Two.</i>

978
01:19:18,586 --> 01:19:20,186
This is Captain John Laine
of Pangea.

979
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:21,756
Please respond.

980
01:19:23,524 --> 01:19:25,926
I reprogrammed Pangea
to locate Station Two.

981
01:19:26,060 --> 01:19:27,494
Give me a few days
to find you.

982
01:19:27,627 --> 01:19:30,296
Once we're in contact,
you'll walk me through

983
01:19:30,430 --> 01:19:32,231
how to fix
this ignition board.

984
01:19:33,632 --> 01:19:35,801
If it takes longer,
I'll conserve resources

985
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:37,604
for as long as I can.

986
01:19:38,637 --> 01:19:40,341
I want you to turn on
the generator,

987
01:19:40,475 --> 01:19:43,944
reposition the stabilizers to
stop the station from moving.

988
01:19:44,078 --> 01:19:45,378
Go into storage.

989
01:19:45,511 --> 01:19:47,849
Turn on the lights so
I know you got this message.

990
01:19:48,850 --> 01:19:50,284
Respond?

991
01:19:53,921 --> 01:19:55,788
Hang in there, Jackie.

992
01:19:55,921 --> 01:19:57,591
I'm coming for you.

993
01:20:18,412 --> 01:20:21,248
<i>I finally understand
why you tortured yourself.</i>

994
01:20:25,153 --> 01:20:26,819
<i>Even though you knew...</i>

995
01:20:30,756 --> 01:20:32,225
<i>you believed.</i>

996
01:20:35,427 --> 01:20:37,698
Just like I believe now.

997
01:20:41,068 --> 01:20:42,668
I'm coming to get you.

998
01:20:47,006 --> 01:20:48,876
And I need you to be there.

999
01:20:57,885 --> 01:21:02,284
Today is June 9, 2198.

1000
01:21:04,623 --> 01:21:07,662
Day 3022 as Captain of Pangea.

1001
01:21:10,596 --> 01:21:12,966
I'm setting out
to locate Station Two...

1002
01:21:13,966 --> 01:21:17,203
<i>and retrieve
Jacquelyn Helen Miller.</i>

1003
01:21:20,106 --> 01:21:25,680
<i>If this recording is received
after June 21, 2198...</i>

1004
01:21:27,646 --> 01:21:31,217
<i>then I, John Raymond Laine...</i>

1005
01:21:33,287 --> 01:21:34,886
<i>92477...</i>

1006
01:21:40,895 --> 01:21:42,729
have become lost en route.

1007
01:22:18,931 --> 01:22:20,533
Open the door.

1008
01:22:36,681 --> 01:22:38,453
<i>I'm not there, John.</i>

1009
01:22:40,020 --> 01:22:41,421
<i>I'm here.</i>

1010
01:22:44,189 --> 01:22:45,492
<i>Be with me.</i>

1011
01:22:47,293 --> 01:22:48,694
<i>Let go.</i>

1012
01:22:50,328 --> 01:22:52,564
You're not her.

1013
01:22:52,698 --> 01:22:55,368
Now, please,
open the flaping door.
