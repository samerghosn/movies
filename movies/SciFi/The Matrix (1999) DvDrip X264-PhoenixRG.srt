3
00:00:47,811 --> 00:00:51,088
<i>- Is everything in place?
- You weren 't supposed to relieve me.</i>

4
00:00:51,332 --> 00:00:53,845
<i>I know, but I felt like taking a shift.</i>

5
00:00:54,371 --> 00:00:56,646
<i>You like him, don 't you?
You like watching him.</i>

6
00:00:56,892 --> 00:00:59,770
<i>- Don 't be ridiculous.
- We're gonna kill him. You understand?</i>

7
00:01:00,012 --> 00:01:02,400
<i>Morpheus believes he is the One.</i>

8
00:01:02,652 --> 00:01:03,481
<i>Do you?</i>

9
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:05,450
<i>It doesn 't matter what I believe.</i>

10
00:01:05,692 --> 00:01:07,250
<i>You don 't, do you?</i>

11
00:01:07,492 --> 00:01:09,483
<i>- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?</i>

12
00:01:09,731 --> 00:01:11,245
<i>Are you sure this line is clean?</i>

13
00:01:11,492 --> 00:01:13,403
<i>Yeah, of course I'm sure.</i>

14
00:01:13,731 --> 00:01:15,131
<i>I better go.</i>

15
00:01:51,531 --> 00:01:53,250
- Freeze! Police!
- Hands on your head!

16
00:01:53,771 --> 00:01:54,807
Do it! Do it now!

17
00:02:15,331 --> 00:02:16,605
Lieutenant.

18
00:02:16,891 --> 00:02:17,847
Oh, shit.

19
00:02:18,651 --> 00:02:21,723
Lieutenant, you were given
specific orders.

20
00:02:21,972 --> 00:02:23,610
I'm just doing my job.

21
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:28,443
You give me that "juris-my-dick-tion"
crap, you can cram it up your ass.

22
00:02:28,891 --> 00:02:31,281
The orders were for your protection.

23
00:02:32,731 --> 00:02:34,848
I think we can handle one little girl.

24
00:02:39,771 --> 00:02:41,444
I sent two units!

25
00:02:41,692 --> 00:02:43,204
They're bringing her down now!

26
00:02:43,451 --> 00:02:46,444
No, Lieutenant, your men
are already dead.

27
00:03:14,645 --> 00:03:15,441
Shit.

28
00:03:17,884 --> 00:03:20,159
Morpheus, the line was traced.
I don't know how.

29
00:03:20,405 --> 00:03:21,918
<i>I know. They cut the hard line.</i>

30
00:03:22,164 --> 00:03:24,235
<i>There's no time.
Get to another exit.</i>

31
00:03:24,485 --> 00:03:25,804
Are there any agents?

32
00:03:26,004 --> 00:03:26,800
<i>Yes.</i>

33
00:03:27,004 --> 00:03:28,120
Goddamn it.

34
00:03:28,365 --> 00:03:29,843
<i>You have to focus, Trinity.</i>

35
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:32,360
<i>There's a phone at Wells and Lake.</i>

36
00:03:32,724 --> 00:03:34,317
<i>You can make it.</i>

37
00:03:34,564 --> 00:03:36,156
<i>- All right.
- Go.</i>

38
00:04:35,764 --> 00:04:36,754
That's impossible.

39
00:05:10,324 --> 00:05:12,281
Get up, Trinity.
Just get up.

40
00:05:12,884 --> 00:05:14,033
Get up.

41
00:05:58,045 --> 00:05:59,478
She got out.

42
00:05:59,764 --> 00:06:00,992
It doesn't matter.

43
00:06:01,245 --> 00:06:03,235
The informant is real.

44
00:06:04,524 --> 00:06:06,117
We have the name of their next target.

45
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:07,956
The name is Neo.

46
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:12,557
We'll need a search running.

47
00:06:12,845 --> 00:06:14,675
It has already begun.

48
00:07:07,204 --> 00:07:08,353
What?

49
00:07:13,884 --> 00:07:15,317
What the hell?

50
00:07:22,644 --> 00:07:24,521
"Follow the white rabbit."

51
00:07:35,884 --> 00:07:37,000
Who is it?

52
00:07:37,245 --> 00:07:38,473
It's Choi.

53
00:07:51,444 --> 00:07:52,560
You're two hours late.

54
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:54,797
I know. It's her fault.

55
00:07:55,084 --> 00:07:55,995
You got the money?

56
00:07:58,045 --> 00:07:59,159
Two grand.

57
00:08:00,004 --> 00:08:01,074
Hold on.

58
00:08:18,045 --> 00:08:19,363
Hallelujah.

59
00:08:19,605 --> 00:08:22,358
You're my savior.
My own personal Jesus Christ.

60
00:08:22,605 --> 00:08:24,401
You get caught using that...

61
00:08:24,644 --> 00:08:26,680
I know. This never happened.
You don't exist.

62
00:08:27,764 --> 00:08:29,755
- Right.
- Something wrong, man?

63
00:08:30,004 --> 00:08:31,961
You look a little whiter than usual.

64
00:08:33,044 --> 00:08:35,115
My computer, it...

65
00:08:38,004 --> 00:08:42,361
Ever have that feeling where you're
not sure if you're awake or dreaming?

66
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:45,764
All the time.
It's called mescaline.

67
00:08:46,245 --> 00:08:48,280
It's the only way to fly.

68
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:51,514
It just sounds like you
need to unplug.

69
00:08:52,245 --> 00:08:54,201
Get some R and R?

70
00:08:54,565 --> 00:08:58,159
What do you think, Dujour?
Should we take him with us?

71
00:09:00,085 --> 00:09:01,234
Definitely.

72
00:09:01,485 --> 00:09:04,522
No, I can't. I have work tomorrow.

73
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,114
Come on.

74
00:09:06,365 --> 00:09:08,879
It'll be fun. I promise.

75
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:16,557
Yeah.

76
00:09:17,365 --> 00:09:19,162
Sure. I'll go.

77
00:09:45,725 --> 00:09:46,634
Hello, Neo.

78
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,034
How do you know that name?

79
00:09:49,845 --> 00:09:51,482
I know a lot about you.

80
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:53,120
Who are you?

81
00:09:53,365 --> 00:09:54,320
My name is Trinity.

82
00:09:55,245 --> 00:09:56,394
Trinity.

83
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,080
The Trinity?

84
00:09:59,524 --> 00:10:01,163
That cracked the IRS D-base?

85
00:10:01,404 --> 00:10:02,803
That was a long time ago.

86
00:10:03,044 --> 00:10:03,841
Jesus.

87
00:10:04,085 --> 00:10:04,880
What?

88
00:10:05,325 --> 00:10:07,043
I just thought...

89
00:10:08,725 --> 00:10:09,840
...you were a guy.

90
00:10:10,085 --> 00:10:11,484
Most guys do.

91
00:10:12,644 --> 00:10:14,760
That was you on my computer.

92
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:16,433
How did you do that?

93
00:10:17,044 --> 00:10:19,639
Right now, all I can tell you...

94
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:21,724
...is that you're in danger.

95
00:10:22,164 --> 00:10:24,474
- I brought you here to warn you.
- Of what?

96
00:10:25,044 --> 00:10:26,636
They're watching you, Neo.

97
00:10:27,205 --> 00:10:28,000
Who is?

98
00:10:28,205 --> 00:10:29,524
Please just listen.

99
00:10:32,884 --> 00:10:34,636
I know why you're here, Neo.

100
00:10:35,404 --> 00:10:37,282
I know what you've been doing.

101
00:10:37,524 --> 00:10:39,322
I know why you hardly sleep...

102
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:42,596
...why you live alone and why,
night after night...

103
00:10:42,845 --> 00:10:45,075
...you sit at your computer.

104
00:10:46,205 --> 00:10:47,683
You're looking for him.

105
00:10:48,445 --> 00:10:51,322
I know, because I was once
looking for the same thing.

106
00:10:51,804 --> 00:10:53,841
And when he found me...

107
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:57,403
...he told me I wasn't really
looking for him...

108
00:10:58,284 --> 00:10:59,956
...I was looking for an answer.

109
00:11:00,565 --> 00:11:03,557
It's the question that drives us, Neo.

110
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,764
It's the question
that brought you here.

111
00:11:08,764 --> 00:11:10,083
You know the question...

112
00:11:10,325 --> 00:11:11,758
...just as I did.

113
00:11:13,245 --> 00:11:14,802
What is the Matrix?

114
00:11:15,044 --> 00:11:17,399
The answer is out there, Neo.

115
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:19,956
It's looking for you.

116
00:11:20,725 --> 00:11:22,363
And it will find you...

117
00:11:22,605 --> 00:11:24,515
...if you want it to.

118
00:11:31,044 --> 00:11:31,841
Shit.

119
00:11:32,085 --> 00:11:33,278
Shit, shit.

120
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:45,844
You have a problem with authority,
Mr. Anderson.

121
00:11:46,085 --> 00:11:49,963
You believe that you are special,
that the rules do not apply to you.

122
00:11:50,644 --> 00:11:52,556
Obviously, you are mistaken.

123
00:11:55,404 --> 00:11:58,158
This is one of the top
software companies in the world...

124
00:11:58,404 --> 00:12:01,635
...because employees understand
they are part of a whole.

125
00:12:01,884 --> 00:12:06,322
Thus, if an employee has a problem,
the company has a problem.

126
00:12:08,485 --> 00:12:11,557
The time has come to make
a choice, Mr. Anderson.

127
00:12:12,404 --> 00:12:16,114
Either you choose to be at your desk
on time from this day forth...

128
00:12:16,725 --> 00:12:19,192
...or you choose to find another job.

129
00:12:20,044 --> 00:12:21,318
Do I make myself clear?

130
00:12:21,565 --> 00:12:23,874
Yes, Mr. Rhineheart.
Perfectly clear.

131
00:12:32,004 --> 00:12:32,801
Thomas Anderson?

132
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,357
Yeah, that's me.

133
00:12:44,044 --> 00:12:45,159
Great.

134
00:12:46,524 --> 00:12:47,639
Have a nice day.

135
00:13:03,764 --> 00:13:06,961
<i>Hello, Neo. Do you know who this is?</i>

136
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:10,797
<i>- Morpheus.
- Yes.</i>

137
00:13:11,044 --> 00:13:12,956
<i>I've been looking for you.</i>

138
00:13:13,205 --> 00:13:16,241
<i>I don 't know if you're ready to see
what I want to show you.</i>

139
00:13:16,485 --> 00:13:19,522
<i>But unfortunately, you and I
have run out of time.</i>

140
00:13:19,764 --> 00:13:23,313
<i>They're coming for you, and I don 't know
what they're going to do.</i>

141
00:13:23,565 --> 00:13:24,838
Who's coming for me?

142
00:13:25,085 --> 00:13:27,076
<i>Stand up and see for yourself.</i>

143
00:13:27,325 --> 00:13:28,758
What? Right now?

144
00:13:29,044 --> 00:13:30,000
<i>Yes.</i>

145
00:13:30,245 --> 00:13:31,438
<i>Now.</i>

146
00:13:32,284 --> 00:13:34,081
<i>Do it slowly.</i>

147
00:13:34,485 --> 00:13:35,634
<i>The elevator.</i>

148
00:13:40,325 --> 00:13:42,043
Oh, shit!

149
00:13:46,524 --> 00:13:47,480
What do they want?

150
00:13:47,725 --> 00:13:51,240
<i>I don 't know. If you don 't want
to find out, get out of there.</i>

151
00:13:51,485 --> 00:13:52,076
How?

152
00:13:52,284 --> 00:13:55,322
<i>I can guide you,
but you must do exactly as I say.</i>

153
00:13:56,164 --> 00:13:58,076
<i>The cubicle across from you is empty.</i>

154
00:14:01,085 --> 00:14:03,120
<i>- But what if they...
- Go. Now.</i>

155
00:14:09,605 --> 00:14:11,879
<i>Stay here for just a moment.</i>

156
00:14:18,804 --> 00:14:21,443
<i>When I tell you,
go to the end of the row...</i>

157
00:14:21,684 --> 00:14:23,562
<i>... to the office
at the end of the hall.</i>

158
00:14:23,804 --> 00:14:26,080
<i>Stay as low as you can.</i>

159
00:14:28,404 --> 00:14:29,360
<i>Go. Now.</i>

160
00:14:43,164 --> 00:14:46,554
<i>Good. Now, outside
there is a scaffold.</i>

161
00:14:49,164 --> 00:14:51,394
<i>- How do you know this?
- We don 't have time.</i>

162
00:14:51,644 --> 00:14:54,364
<i>To your left there's a window.
Go to it.</i>

163
00:14:56,524 --> 00:14:58,004
<i>Open it.</i>

164
00:14:58,804 --> 00:15:00,523
<i>Take the scaffold to the roof.</i>

165
00:15:00,764 --> 00:15:03,232
No way! No way!
This is crazy!

166
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:05,759
<i>There are two ways
out of this building.</i>

167
00:15:06,004 --> 00:15:09,634
<i>One is that scaffold.
The other is in their custody.</i>

168
00:15:09,884 --> 00:15:12,956
<i>You take a chance either way.
I leave it to you.</i>

169
00:15:16,404 --> 00:15:18,076
This is insane!

170
00:15:19,205 --> 00:15:21,001
Why is this happening to me?

171
00:15:21,284 --> 00:15:22,842
What'd I do?

172
00:15:23,205 --> 00:15:25,844
I'm nobody.
I didn't do anything.

173
00:15:26,404 --> 00:15:27,803
I'm gonna die.

174
00:15:37,205 --> 00:15:38,193
Shit!

175
00:15:57,644 --> 00:15:58,713
Oh, shit!

176
00:16:03,485 --> 00:16:05,202
I can't do this.

177
00:16:17,524 --> 00:16:18,321
Shit.

178
00:17:05,565 --> 00:17:10,194
As you can see, we've had our eye
on you for some time now, Mr. Anderson.

179
00:17:11,444 --> 00:17:14,005
It seems that you've been living...

180
00:17:14,244 --> 00:17:16,280
...two lives.

181
00:17:17,644 --> 00:17:20,034
In one life,
you're Thomas A. Anderson...

182
00:17:20,285 --> 00:17:23,481
...program writer for
a respectable software company.

183
00:17:24,484 --> 00:17:27,635
You have a social security number.
You pay your taxes.

184
00:17:28,085 --> 00:17:29,278
And you...

185
00:17:30,805 --> 00:17:34,275
...help your landlady
carry out her garbage.

186
00:17:36,684 --> 00:17:39,676
The other life is lived in computers...

187
00:17:39,964 --> 00:17:42,798
...where you go by
the hacker alias "Neo"...

188
00:17:43,045 --> 00:17:47,641
...and are guilty of virtually every
computer crime we have a law for.

189
00:17:48,884 --> 00:17:50,761
One of these lives...

190
00:17:51,005 --> 00:17:52,757
...has a future.

191
00:17:53,085 --> 00:17:54,996
And one of them does not.

192
00:17:58,565 --> 00:18:02,240
I'm going to be as forthcoming
as I can be, Mr. Anderson.

193
00:18:03,204 --> 00:18:04,479
You're here...

194
00:18:04,805 --> 00:18:06,954
...because we need your help.

195
00:18:10,444 --> 00:18:13,323
We know that you've been contacted
by a certain...

196
00:18:13,565 --> 00:18:15,282
...individual.

197
00:18:16,164 --> 00:18:20,044
A man who calls himself "Morpheus."

198
00:18:21,005 --> 00:18:24,838
Whatever you think you know
about this man is irrelevant.

199
00:18:25,085 --> 00:18:27,394
He is considered by many authorities...

200
00:18:27,644 --> 00:18:30,557
...to be the most dangerous man alive.

201
00:18:33,204 --> 00:18:34,354
My colleagues...

202
00:18:34,765 --> 00:18:37,563
...believe that I am wasting
my time with you.

203
00:18:37,845 --> 00:18:41,121
But I believe you wish
to do the right thing.

204
00:18:41,404 --> 00:18:44,760
We're willing to wipe the slate clean...

205
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,161
...give you a fresh start.

206
00:18:47,644 --> 00:18:50,442
All we're asking in return
is your cooperation...

207
00:18:50,684 --> 00:18:54,040
...in bringing
a known terrorist to justice.

208
00:18:55,365 --> 00:18:56,558
Yeah.

209
00:18:57,805 --> 00:18:59,796
That sounds like a really good deal.

210
00:19:01,365 --> 00:19:03,037
But I got a better one.

211
00:19:03,285 --> 00:19:04,718
How about...

212
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,036
...I give you the finger...

213
00:19:09,525 --> 00:19:11,480
...and you give me my phone call.

214
00:19:13,565 --> 00:19:15,317
Mr. Anderson...

215
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:20,320
...you disappoint me.

216
00:19:20,565 --> 00:19:23,078
You can't scare me
with this gestapo crap.

217
00:19:23,325 --> 00:19:24,644
I know my rights.

218
00:19:24,884 --> 00:19:26,317
I want my phone call.

219
00:19:26,884 --> 00:19:28,954
Tell me, Mr. Anderson...

220
00:19:29,805 --> 00:19:31,157
...what good is a phone call...

221
00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:34,840
...if you're unable to speak?

222
00:20:07,244 --> 00:20:09,361
You're going to help us,
Mr. Anderson...

223
00:20:10,045 --> 00:20:10,954
...whether you want to...

224
00:20:11,204 --> 00:20:12,035
...or not.

225
00:21:07,964 --> 00:21:11,082
<i>This line is tapped,
so I must be brief.</i>

226
00:21:11,325 --> 00:21:15,442
<i>They got to you first, but they've
underestimated how important you are.</i>

227
00:21:15,684 --> 00:21:17,436
<i>If they knew what I know...</i>

228
00:21:17,684 --> 00:21:19,596
<i>... you would probably be dead.</i>

229
00:21:20,565 --> 00:21:24,114
What are you talking about?
What is happening to me?

230
00:21:24,365 --> 00:21:28,994
<i>You are the One, Neo. You may have
spent the last few years...</i>

231
00:21:29,244 --> 00:21:32,077
<i>... looking for me, but I've spent
my entire life...</i>

232
00:21:32,325 --> 00:21:33,758
<i>... looking for you.</i>

233
00:21:35,244 --> 00:21:37,315
<i>Now, do you still want to meet?</i>

234
00:21:38,244 --> 00:21:40,998
<i>- Yes.
- Then go to the Adams Street bridge.</i>

235
00:21:50,805 --> 00:21:51,953
Get in.

236
00:22:03,724 --> 00:22:04,520
What's this?

237
00:22:04,765 --> 00:22:07,199
It's necessary, Neo.
For our protection.

238
00:22:07,444 --> 00:22:08,400
From what?

239
00:22:08,644 --> 00:22:09,520
From you.

240
00:22:11,005 --> 00:22:12,403
Take off your shirt.

241
00:22:12,884 --> 00:22:13,681
Stop the car.

242
00:22:18,085 --> 00:22:19,200
Listen, coppertop.

243
00:22:19,444 --> 00:22:21,355
We don't have time for 20 Questions.

244
00:22:21,845 --> 00:22:24,119
Right now, there's only one rule:

245
00:22:24,404 --> 00:22:25,679
Our way...

246
00:22:26,005 --> 00:22:27,039
...or the highway.

247
00:22:33,525 --> 00:22:34,355
Fine.

248
00:22:36,164 --> 00:22:38,519
Please, Neo, you have to trust me.

249
00:22:39,085 --> 00:22:41,598
- Why?
- Because you have been down there.

250
00:22:42,325 --> 00:22:43,473
You know that road.

251
00:22:44,444 --> 00:22:46,037
You know exactly where it ends.

252
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:50,275
And I know that's
not where you want to be.

253
00:23:03,884 --> 00:23:05,364
Apoc, lights.

254
00:23:07,765 --> 00:23:09,835
Lie back.
Lift up your shirt.

255
00:23:11,684 --> 00:23:12,480
What's that?

256
00:23:12,805 --> 00:23:13,839
You're bugged.

257
00:23:21,285 --> 00:23:22,683
Try and relax.

258
00:23:28,724 --> 00:23:29,839
Come on.

259
00:23:31,005 --> 00:23:31,835
Come on.

260
00:23:33,565 --> 00:23:34,441
It's on the move.

261
00:23:36,204 --> 00:23:37,354
Come on, you shit.

262
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:41,319
- You're gonna lose it.
- No, I'm not.

263
00:23:41,565 --> 00:23:42,474
Clear!

264
00:23:50,724 --> 00:23:52,760
Jesus Christ!
That thing's real?!

265
00:24:25,125 --> 00:24:26,398
This is it.

266
00:24:29,605 --> 00:24:31,960
Let me give you one piece of advice.

267
00:24:32,884 --> 00:24:34,477
Be honest.

268
00:24:36,005 --> 00:24:38,121
He knows more than you can imagine.

269
00:24:46,484 --> 00:24:47,759
At last.

270
00:24:49,244 --> 00:24:50,279
Welcome, Neo.

271
00:24:51,444 --> 00:24:53,276
As you no doubt have guessed...

272
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:54,719
...I am Morpheus.

273
00:24:55,724 --> 00:24:57,238
It's an honor to meet you.

274
00:24:57,684 --> 00:24:58,673
No...

275
00:24:59,244 --> 00:25:00,472
...the honor is mine.

276
00:25:01,365 --> 00:25:03,753
Please, come. Sit.

277
00:25:18,244 --> 00:25:19,803
I imagine...

278
00:25:20,204 --> 00:25:22,844
...that right now you're feeling
a bit like Alice...

279
00:25:24,484 --> 00:25:26,794
...tumbling down the rabbit hole?

280
00:25:27,684 --> 00:25:28,640
You could say that.

281
00:25:29,525 --> 00:25:32,038
I can see it in your eyes.

282
00:25:32,605 --> 00:25:35,756
You have the look of a man
who accepts what he sees...

283
00:25:36,005 --> 00:25:38,154
...because he's expecting to wake up.

284
00:25:39,525 --> 00:25:42,038
Ironically, this is not
far from the truth.

285
00:25:42,684 --> 00:25:45,074
Do you believe in fate, Neo?

286
00:25:45,365 --> 00:25:46,194
No.

287
00:25:46,644 --> 00:25:47,555
Why not?

288
00:25:47,805 --> 00:25:50,478
I don't like the idea that
I'm not in control of my life.

289
00:25:51,525 --> 00:25:54,721
I know exactly what you mean.

290
00:25:58,845 --> 00:26:01,119
Let me tell you why you're here.

291
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:03,604
You know something.

292
00:26:04,125 --> 00:26:05,682
What you know,
you can't explain.

293
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:07,678
But you feel it.

294
00:26:08,244 --> 00:26:10,076
You felt it your entire life.

295
00:26:10,644 --> 00:26:14,637
Something's wrong with the world.
You don't know what, but it's there.

296
00:26:15,125 --> 00:26:17,240
Like a splinter in your mind...

297
00:26:17,484 --> 00:26:19,281
...driving you mad.

298
00:26:20,164 --> 00:26:22,804
It is this feeling
that has brought you to me.

299
00:26:25,244 --> 00:26:26,997
Do you know what
I'm talking about?

300
00:26:28,765 --> 00:26:30,038
The Matrix?

301
00:26:32,444 --> 00:26:34,037
Do you want to know...

302
00:26:34,484 --> 00:26:36,395
...what it is?

303
00:26:38,684 --> 00:26:40,481
The Matrix is everywhere.

304
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,363
It is all around us.

305
00:26:42,605 --> 00:26:44,481
Even now, in this very room.

306
00:26:45,285 --> 00:26:47,401
You can see it when you
look out your window...

307
00:26:47,644 --> 00:26:49,875
...or when you turn on your television.

308
00:26:50,285 --> 00:26:52,719
You can feel it when you go to work...

309
00:26:54,204 --> 00:26:55,797
...when you go to church...

310
00:26:56,204 --> 00:26:58,195
...when you pay your taxes.

311
00:26:59,285 --> 00:27:02,083
It is the world that has been
pulled over your eyes...

312
00:27:02,325 --> 00:27:03,837
...to blind you from the truth.

313
00:27:05,964 --> 00:27:07,159
What truth?

314
00:27:11,244 --> 00:27:12,723
That you are a slave.

315
00:27:14,164 --> 00:27:16,359
Like everyone else,
you were born into bondage...

316
00:27:16,605 --> 00:27:21,076
...born into a prison that you cannot
smell or taste or touch.

317
00:27:21,365 --> 00:27:22,593
A prison...

318
00:27:22,845 --> 00:27:23,960
...for your mind.

319
00:27:30,644 --> 00:27:32,875
Unfortunately, no one can be...

320
00:27:33,204 --> 00:27:35,480
...told what the Matrix is.

321
00:27:38,805 --> 00:27:40,602
You have to see it for yourself.

322
00:27:49,724 --> 00:27:51,920
This is your last chance.

323
00:27:52,164 --> 00:27:54,394
After this, there is no turning back.

324
00:27:54,845 --> 00:27:56,278
You take the blue pill...

325
00:27:56,565 --> 00:27:59,477
...the story ends, you wake up
in your bed and believe...

326
00:27:59,724 --> 00:28:01,442
...whatever you want to believe.

327
00:28:01,684 --> 00:28:02,959
You take the red pill...

328
00:28:03,204 --> 00:28:05,082
...you stay in Wonderland...

329
00:28:05,565 --> 00:28:08,159
...and I show you how deep
the rabbit hole goes.

330
00:28:17,644 --> 00:28:18,794
Remember...

331
00:28:19,605 --> 00:28:22,517
...all I'm offering is the truth.
Nothing more.

332
00:28:36,244 --> 00:28:37,519
Follow me.

333
00:28:39,964 --> 00:28:41,557
Apoc, are we on-line?

334
00:28:41,805 --> 00:28:43,124
Almost.

335
00:28:46,325 --> 00:28:48,280
Time is always against us.

336
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:50,077
Please take a seat there.

337
00:29:07,525 --> 00:29:09,163
You did all this?

338
00:29:13,125 --> 00:29:15,036
The pill you took is
part of a trace program.

339
00:29:15,765 --> 00:29:20,201
It disrupts your carrier signals
so we can pinpoint your location.

340
00:29:20,724 --> 00:29:21,713
What does that mean?

341
00:29:22,285 --> 00:29:24,355
It means buckle your
seat belt, Dorothy...

342
00:29:24,684 --> 00:29:25,959
...because Kansas...

343
00:29:26,204 --> 00:29:27,193
...is going bye-bye.

344
00:30:03,565 --> 00:30:04,884
Did you...?

345
00:30:15,444 --> 00:30:19,357
Have you ever had a dream, Neo,
that you were so sure was real?

346
00:30:20,765 --> 00:30:23,232
What if you were unable
to wake from that dream?

347
00:30:23,484 --> 00:30:25,874
How would you know the difference
between the dream world...

348
00:30:26,484 --> 00:30:27,837
...and the real world?

349
00:30:29,404 --> 00:30:30,554
This can't be.

350
00:30:30,805 --> 00:30:31,681
Be what?

351
00:30:32,365 --> 00:30:33,798
Be real?

352
00:30:37,605 --> 00:30:38,833
Going into replication.

353
00:30:39,285 --> 00:30:40,115
Still nothing.

354
00:30:40,684 --> 00:30:41,834
It's cold.

355
00:30:42,085 --> 00:30:43,403
It's cold!

356
00:30:47,125 --> 00:30:48,717
Tank, we'll need a signal soon.

357
00:30:50,204 --> 00:30:51,000
I got a fibrillation.

358
00:30:51,244 --> 00:30:52,723
Apoc, location.

359
00:30:52,964 --> 00:30:54,364
Targeting almost there.

360
00:30:57,525 --> 00:30:58,877
He's going into arrest.

361
00:30:59,125 --> 00:30:59,921
Lock. I got him!

362
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:01,523
Now, Tank, now!

363
00:33:51,517 --> 00:33:52,551
Welcome...

364
00:33:52,876 --> 00:33:54,708
...to the real world.

365
00:33:56,076 --> 00:33:57,828
We've done it, Trinity.

366
00:33:58,076 --> 00:33:59,556
We found him.

367
00:33:59,797 --> 00:34:02,470
- I hope you're right.
- I don't have to hope.

368
00:34:03,037 --> 00:34:04,549
I know it.

369
00:34:09,516 --> 00:34:10,505
Am I dead?

370
00:34:10,996 --> 00:34:13,067
Far from it.

371
00:34:26,476 --> 00:34:27,829
He still needs a lot of work.

372
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:30,351
What are you doing?

373
00:34:30,597 --> 00:34:32,713
Your muscles atrophied.
We're rebuilding them.

374
00:34:33,277 --> 00:34:34,755
Why do my eyes hurt?

375
00:34:35,436 --> 00:34:37,233
You've never used them before.

376
00:34:41,036 --> 00:34:41,833
Rest, Neo.

377
00:34:42,077 --> 00:34:43,668
The answers are coming.

378
00:35:55,197 --> 00:35:56,710
Morpheus, what's happened to me?

379
00:35:57,436 --> 00:35:58,347
What is this place?

380
00:35:58,597 --> 00:36:01,157
More important than "what" is "when."

381
00:36:01,836 --> 00:36:02,632
When?

382
00:36:02,836 --> 00:36:04,793
You believe it's the year 1999...

383
00:36:05,036 --> 00:36:07,186
...when in fact, it's closer to 2199.

384
00:36:08,277 --> 00:36:10,916
I can't tell you exactly
what year it is...

385
00:36:11,157 --> 00:36:12,715
...because we honestly don't know.

386
00:36:13,197 --> 00:36:15,916
There's nothing I can say
that will explain it for you.

387
00:36:16,157 --> 00:36:17,271
Come with me.

388
00:36:17,556 --> 00:36:18,784
See for yourself.

389
00:36:19,317 --> 00:36:20,989
This is my ship.

390
00:36:21,277 --> 00:36:24,074
<i>The Nebuchadnezzar.
It's a hovercraft.</i>

391
00:36:26,797 --> 00:36:28,469
This is the main deck.

392
00:36:34,237 --> 00:36:35,192
This is the core...

393
00:36:37,597 --> 00:36:41,192
...where we broadcast our pirate signal
and hack into the Matrix.

394
00:36:44,436 --> 00:36:47,474
Most of my crew you already know.

395
00:36:52,277 --> 00:36:53,630
This is Apoc...

396
00:36:54,396 --> 00:36:55,670
...Switch...

397
00:36:57,197 --> 00:36:58,311
...and Cypher.

398
00:36:58,556 --> 00:37:02,106
The ones you don't know:
Tank and his big brother, Dozer.

399
00:37:02,956 --> 00:37:05,266
The little one behind you is Mouse.

400
00:37:09,436 --> 00:37:12,554
You wanted to know
what the Matrix is?

401
00:37:13,556 --> 00:37:14,706
Trinity.

402
00:37:34,876 --> 00:37:36,389
Try to relax.

403
00:37:41,077 --> 00:37:42,829
This will feel a little weird.

404
00:37:54,317 --> 00:37:55,431
This...

405
00:37:55,797 --> 00:37:57,434
...is the Construct.

406
00:37:57,836 --> 00:37:59,873
It's our loading program.

407
00:38:00,117 --> 00:38:02,472
We can load anything, from clothing...

408
00:38:02,717 --> 00:38:04,036
...to equipment...

409
00:38:04,317 --> 00:38:05,590
...weapons...

410
00:38:06,197 --> 00:38:07,949
...training simulations...

411
00:38:08,317 --> 00:38:10,751
...anything we need.

412
00:38:13,436 --> 00:38:15,746
Right now we're inside
a computer program?

413
00:38:16,036 --> 00:38:17,867
Is it really so hard to believe?

414
00:38:18,356 --> 00:38:20,871
Your clothes are different.
The plugs in your body are gone.

415
00:38:22,036 --> 00:38:24,027
Your hair has changed.

416
00:38:24,396 --> 00:38:27,594
Your appearance now is what we call
"residual self-image."

417
00:38:28,277 --> 00:38:30,791
It is the mental projection
of your digital self.

418
00:38:36,436 --> 00:38:37,505
This isn't real?

419
00:38:37,757 --> 00:38:39,235
What is "real"?

420
00:38:39,597 --> 00:38:41,746
How do you define "real"?

421
00:38:42,036 --> 00:38:43,867
If you're talking about
what you can feel...

422
00:38:44,117 --> 00:38:46,425
...what you can smell, taste and see...

423
00:38:46,677 --> 00:38:50,385
...then "real" is simply electrical
signals interpreted by your brain.

424
00:38:54,396 --> 00:38:56,706
This is the world that you know.

425
00:38:58,077 --> 00:39:00,989
The world as it was at the end
of the 20th century.

426
00:39:03,277 --> 00:39:07,429
It exists now only as part of
a neural-interactive simulation...

427
00:39:07,677 --> 00:39:08,871
...that we call the Matrix.

428
00:39:13,237 --> 00:39:15,956
You've been living
in a dream world, Neo.

429
00:39:16,876 --> 00:39:17,945
This is the world...

430
00:39:18,237 --> 00:39:19,954
...as it exists today.

431
00:39:32,436 --> 00:39:35,269
Welcome to "the desert...

432
00:39:36,117 --> 00:39:37,630
...of the real."

433
00:39:40,876 --> 00:39:43,152
We have only bits and pieces
of information.

434
00:39:43,396 --> 00:39:47,025
But what we know for certain
is that in the early 21 st century...

435
00:39:47,277 --> 00:39:50,393
...all of mankind was united
in celebration.

436
00:39:50,637 --> 00:39:55,188
We marveled at our own magnificence
as we gave birth to Al.

437
00:39:55,956 --> 00:39:57,025
Al.

438
00:39:58,036 --> 00:39:59,356
You mean artificial intelligence.

439
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:03,829
A singular consciousness that spawned
an entire race of machines.

440
00:40:04,637 --> 00:40:07,947
We don't know who struck first,
us or them.

441
00:40:08,356 --> 00:40:11,429
But we know that it was us
that scorched the sky.

442
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:15,106
They were dependent on solar power...

443
00:40:15,356 --> 00:40:18,554
...and it was believed that
they would be unable to survive...

444
00:40:18,876 --> 00:40:22,233
...without an energy source
as abundant as the sun.

445
00:40:22,476 --> 00:40:27,152
Throughout human history, we have been
dependent on machines to survive.

446
00:40:28,556 --> 00:40:32,596
Fate, it seems, is not
without a sense of irony.

447
00:40:35,677 --> 00:40:39,909
The human body generates more
bioelectricity than a 120-volt battery.

448
00:40:40,157 --> 00:40:44,115
And over 25,000 BTUs of body heat.

449
00:40:45,956 --> 00:40:48,027
Combined with a form of fusion...

450
00:40:48,356 --> 00:40:52,987
...the machines had found all the energy
they would ever need.

451
00:40:56,876 --> 00:41:00,472
There are fields, Neo,
endless fields...

452
00:41:00,717 --> 00:41:03,833
...where human beings
are no longer born.

453
00:41:04,516 --> 00:41:06,268
We are grown.

454
00:41:12,077 --> 00:41:14,545
For the longest time,
I wouldn't believe it.

455
00:41:14,797 --> 00:41:17,356
And then I saw the fields
with my own eyes...

456
00:41:18,637 --> 00:41:20,195
...watched them liquefy the dead...

457
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:23,634
...so they could be fed intravenously
to the living.

458
00:41:24,157 --> 00:41:28,230
And standing there,
facing the pure, horrifying precision...

459
00:41:28,476 --> 00:41:31,275
...I came to realize
the obviousness of the truth.

460
00:41:33,797 --> 00:41:35,514
What is the Matrix?

461
00:41:36,677 --> 00:41:37,666
Control.

462
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:42,228
The Matrix is a computer-generated
dream world...

463
00:41:42,996 --> 00:41:45,954
...built to keep us under control...

464
00:41:47,077 --> 00:41:50,114
...in order to change a human being...

465
00:41:50,717 --> 00:41:51,831
...into this.

466
00:41:53,157 --> 00:41:54,226
No.

467
00:41:55,797 --> 00:41:57,309
I don't believe it.

468
00:41:57,677 --> 00:41:58,826
It's not possible.

469
00:41:59,396 --> 00:42:03,788
I didn't say it would be easy, Neo.
I just said it would be the truth.

470
00:42:04,036 --> 00:42:04,833
Stop!

471
00:42:05,797 --> 00:42:06,945
Let me out!

472
00:42:07,637 --> 00:42:09,467
Let me out! I want out!

473
00:42:11,356 --> 00:42:13,916
- Easy, Neo. Easy.
- Get this thing out of me.

474
00:42:14,157 --> 00:42:15,748
Get this thing out of me!

475
00:42:17,476 --> 00:42:18,909
Don't touch me!

476
00:42:19,157 --> 00:42:20,715
Stay away from me!

477
00:42:21,117 --> 00:42:22,550
I don't believe it.

478
00:42:23,237 --> 00:42:24,385
I don't believe it.

479
00:42:24,637 --> 00:42:25,592
I don't believe it.

480
00:42:26,317 --> 00:42:28,273
- He's gonna pop.
- Breathe, Neo.

481
00:42:28,836 --> 00:42:29,666
Just breathe.

482
00:42:47,317 --> 00:42:49,034
I can't go back, can I?

483
00:42:49,956 --> 00:42:50,867
No.

484
00:42:51,996 --> 00:42:53,146
But if you could...

485
00:42:53,956 --> 00:42:55,389
...would you really want to?

486
00:42:57,797 --> 00:42:59,150
I owe you an apology.

487
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:00,996
We have a rule.

488
00:43:01,436 --> 00:43:04,668
We never free a mind
once it's reached a certain age.

489
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:05,746
It's dangerous.

490
00:43:06,436 --> 00:43:08,074
The mind has trouble letting go.

491
00:43:08,317 --> 00:43:10,512
I've seen it before, and I'm sorry.

492
00:43:11,516 --> 00:43:13,507
I did what I did because...

493
00:43:14,197 --> 00:43:15,596
...I had to.

494
00:43:23,677 --> 00:43:27,590
When the Matrix was first built,
there was a man born inside...

495
00:43:28,077 --> 00:43:31,706
...who had the ability
to change whatever he wanted...

496
00:43:32,077 --> 00:43:34,875
...to remake the Matrix as he saw fit.

497
00:43:36,556 --> 00:43:39,867
It was he who freed the first of us...

498
00:43:40,717 --> 00:43:42,275
...taught us the truth.

499
00:43:43,677 --> 00:43:46,635
As long as the Matrix exists...

500
00:43:46,956 --> 00:43:48,947
...the human race will never be free.

501
00:43:52,996 --> 00:43:54,476
After he died...

502
00:43:55,197 --> 00:43:57,791
...the Oracle prophesied his return...

503
00:43:58,317 --> 00:44:01,389
...and that his coming would hail
the destruction of the Matrix...

504
00:44:01,637 --> 00:44:03,228
...end the war...

505
00:44:03,556 --> 00:44:04,706
...bring freedom to our people.

506
00:44:06,036 --> 00:44:10,474
That is why there are those of us who
spent our lives searching the Matrix...

507
00:44:10,797 --> 00:44:12,309
...Iooking for him.

508
00:44:14,637 --> 00:44:16,628
I did what I did because...

509
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:20,233
...I believe that search is over.

510
00:44:25,117 --> 00:44:26,469
Get some rest.

511
00:44:27,077 --> 00:44:28,795
You're going to need it.

512
00:44:31,597 --> 00:44:32,393
For what?

513
00:44:35,516 --> 00:44:36,472
Your training.

514
00:44:54,036 --> 00:44:55,675
Morning. Did you sleep?

515
00:44:56,516 --> 00:44:57,666
You will tonight.

516
00:44:58,036 --> 00:44:59,516
I guarantee it.

517
00:45:00,956 --> 00:45:02,788
I'm Tank. I'll be your operator.

518
00:45:03,237 --> 00:45:05,545
- You don't have any...
- Holes? Nope.

519
00:45:06,436 --> 00:45:10,952
Me and my brother, Dozer, are 100% pure,
old-fashioned, homegrown human.

520
00:45:11,197 --> 00:45:12,346
Born free right here...

521
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:14,150
...in the real world.

522
00:45:14,396 --> 00:45:15,989
Genuine child of Zion.

523
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:19,152
- Zion?
- Lf the war was over tomorrow...

524
00:45:19,396 --> 00:45:20,750
...Zion's where the party would be.

525
00:45:21,237 --> 00:45:22,465
It's a city?

526
00:45:22,717 --> 00:45:25,753
The last human city.
The only place we have left.

527
00:45:27,277 --> 00:45:28,471
Where is it?

528
00:45:30,157 --> 00:45:31,112
Deep underground...

529
00:45:31,356 --> 00:45:33,427
...near the Earth's core,
where it's still warm.

530
00:45:34,996 --> 00:45:36,793
You live long enough,
you might see it.

531
00:45:38,956 --> 00:45:43,586
Goddamn! I gotta tell you, I'm excited
to see what you're capable of...

532
00:45:43,836 --> 00:45:45,509
...if Morpheus is right and all.

533
00:45:45,996 --> 00:45:48,635
We're not supposed to
talk about this, but...

534
00:45:48,876 --> 00:45:50,230
...if you are...

535
00:45:51,277 --> 00:45:53,188
...it's a very exciting time.

536
00:45:54,197 --> 00:45:56,791
We got a lot to do.
We gotta get to it.

537
00:46:00,556 --> 00:46:03,355
We're supposed to start
with these programs first.

538
00:46:04,317 --> 00:46:07,626
That's major boring shit.
Let's do something more fun.

539
00:46:07,956 --> 00:46:09,389
How about...

540
00:46:10,876 --> 00:46:12,548
...combat training?

541
00:46:18,356 --> 00:46:19,755
"Jujitsu"?

542
00:46:20,597 --> 00:46:22,188
I'm going to learn jujitsu?

543
00:46:33,077 --> 00:46:34,226
Holy shit!

544
00:46:34,476 --> 00:46:36,706
"Hey, Mikey, I think he likes it."

545
00:46:37,036 --> 00:46:38,264
How about some more?

546
00:46:38,516 --> 00:46:39,744
Hell, yes.

547
00:46:41,956 --> 00:46:42,753
Hell, yeah.

548
00:46:54,637 --> 00:46:55,467
How is he?

549
00:46:55,717 --> 00:46:57,833
Ten hours straight.
He's a machine.

550
00:47:08,556 --> 00:47:09,876
I know kung fu.

551
00:47:11,677 --> 00:47:12,472
Show me.

552
00:47:14,157 --> 00:47:15,829
This is a sparring program...

553
00:47:16,077 --> 00:47:18,750
...similar to the programmed reality
of the Matrix.

554
00:47:18,996 --> 00:47:21,226
It has the same basic rules.
Like gravity.

555
00:47:21,476 --> 00:47:24,786
These rules are no different
than those of a computer system.

556
00:47:25,317 --> 00:47:26,750
Some of them can be bent.

557
00:47:26,956 --> 00:47:27,753
Others...

558
00:47:27,996 --> 00:47:29,315
...can be broken.

559
00:47:29,956 --> 00:47:30,867
Understand?

560
00:47:32,117 --> 00:47:32,947
Then hit me...

561
00:47:33,476 --> 00:47:34,545
...if you can.

562
00:48:12,512 --> 00:48:12,945
Good!

563
00:48:13,672 --> 00:48:14,788
Adaptation.

564
00:48:15,072 --> 00:48:16,222
Improvisation.

565
00:48:16,512 --> 00:48:17,786
But your weakness...

566
00:48:18,032 --> 00:48:19,351
...is not your technique.

567
00:48:26,032 --> 00:48:28,023
Morpheus is fighting Neo.

568
00:49:37,353 --> 00:49:38,467
How did I beat you?

569
00:49:44,793 --> 00:49:45,827
You're too fast.

570
00:49:46,353 --> 00:49:47,626
Do you believe that...

571
00:49:47,992 --> 00:49:50,382
...my being stronger or faster...

572
00:49:50,632 --> 00:49:54,148
...has anything to do
with my muscles in this place?

573
00:49:58,032 --> 00:49:59,751
You think you're breathing air?

574
00:50:12,713 --> 00:50:13,862
Again!

575
00:50:24,873 --> 00:50:27,181
Jesus Christ, he's fast!

576
00:50:27,432 --> 00:50:29,548
His neuro-kinetics
are way above normal.

577
00:50:34,793 --> 00:50:36,192
What are you waiting for?

578
00:50:36,432 --> 00:50:38,309
You're faster than this.

579
00:50:40,432 --> 00:50:42,548
Don't think you are.

580
00:50:42,793 --> 00:50:44,385
Know you are.

581
00:50:54,353 --> 00:50:57,072
Come on! Stop trying to hit me,
and hit me!

582
00:51:06,552 --> 00:51:08,224
I don't believe it.

583
00:51:09,713 --> 00:51:11,748
I know what you're trying to do.

584
00:51:13,353 --> 00:51:15,422
I'm trying to free your mind, Neo.

585
00:51:15,753 --> 00:51:17,744
But I can only show you the door.

586
00:51:18,313 --> 00:51:20,143
You have to walk through it.

587
00:51:22,353 --> 00:51:24,389
Tank, load the jump program.

588
00:51:35,512 --> 00:51:38,106
You have to let it all go, Neo.
Fear...

589
00:51:38,632 --> 00:51:40,702
...doubt and disbelief.

590
00:51:41,833 --> 00:51:44,427
Free your mind.

591
00:51:59,952 --> 00:52:01,590
Okey-dokey.

592
00:52:03,592 --> 00:52:04,708
Free my mind.

593
00:52:05,273 --> 00:52:06,228
What if he makes it?

594
00:52:06,472 --> 00:52:09,067
- No one's ever made their first jump.
- I know.

595
00:52:10,353 --> 00:52:12,708
- But what if he does?
- He won't.

596
00:52:13,512 --> 00:52:14,309
Come on.

597
00:52:14,552 --> 00:52:15,668
All right.

598
00:52:16,112 --> 00:52:18,068
No problem. Free my mind.

599
00:52:18,833 --> 00:52:21,505
Free my mind. No problem. Right.

600
00:52:40,112 --> 00:52:41,704
What does that mean?

601
00:52:42,072 --> 00:52:43,824
It doesn't mean anything.

602
00:52:44,393 --> 00:52:46,860
Everybody falls the first time.

603
00:52:47,313 --> 00:52:48,541
Right, Trin?

604
00:53:08,393 --> 00:53:10,907
- I thought it wasn't real.
- Your mind makes it real.

605
00:53:14,032 --> 00:53:16,182
If you're killed in the Matrix...

606
00:53:16,552 --> 00:53:17,349
...you die here?

607
00:53:17,952 --> 00:53:20,307
The body cannot live without the mind.

608
00:53:49,552 --> 00:53:52,784
I don't remember you ever
bringing me dinner.

609
00:53:55,753 --> 00:53:58,472
There is something about him,
isn't there?

610
00:53:59,072 --> 00:54:00,630
You're a believer now?

611
00:54:01,592 --> 00:54:02,742
I keep wondering...

612
00:54:02,992 --> 00:54:06,507
...if Morpheus is so sure,
why not take him to see the Oracle?

613
00:54:07,393 --> 00:54:10,190
Morpheus will take him
when he's ready.

614
00:54:19,592 --> 00:54:21,072
The Matrix is a system, Neo.

615
00:54:22,753 --> 00:54:23,981
That system is our enemy.

616
00:54:24,592 --> 00:54:26,822
But when you're inside,
what do you see?

617
00:54:27,072 --> 00:54:30,702
Businessmen, teachers,
lawyers, carpenters.

618
00:54:31,152 --> 00:54:33,621
The very minds of the people
we are trying to save.

619
00:54:33,873 --> 00:54:36,706
But until we do, these people are
a part of that system...

620
00:54:36,952 --> 00:54:38,784
...and that makes them our enemy.

621
00:54:39,152 --> 00:54:40,108
You have to understand...

622
00:54:40,353 --> 00:54:43,550
...most of these people are not
ready to be unplugged.

623
00:54:43,793 --> 00:54:45,306
And many of them are so inert...

624
00:54:45,552 --> 00:54:46,672
...so hopelessly dependent
on the system...

625
00:54:46,672 --> 00:54:47,867
...so hopelessly dependent
on the system...

626
00:54:48,112 --> 00:54:50,706
...that they will fight to protect it.

627
00:54:52,152 --> 00:54:55,748
Were you listening to me or looking
at the woman in the red dress?

628
00:54:56,713 --> 00:54:57,588
Look again.

629
00:54:58,793 --> 00:54:59,827
Freeze it.

630
00:55:06,193 --> 00:55:07,751
This isn't the Matrix?

631
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:13,148
It's another training program
designed to teach you one thing:

632
00:55:13,753 --> 00:55:16,061
If you are not one of us,
you are one of them.

633
00:55:16,592 --> 00:55:19,266
- What are they?
- Sentient programs.

634
00:55:19,992 --> 00:55:24,110
They can move in and out of any software
still hardwired to their system.

635
00:55:24,472 --> 00:55:27,704
That means that anyone
we haven't unplugged...

636
00:55:28,032 --> 00:55:29,306
...is potentially an agent.

637
00:55:30,233 --> 00:55:31,985
Inside the Matrix...

638
00:55:32,552 --> 00:55:34,190
...they are everyone...

639
00:55:34,512 --> 00:55:36,150
...and they are no one.

640
00:55:36,393 --> 00:55:39,385
We have survived by hiding
and running from them...

641
00:55:39,632 --> 00:55:41,190
...but they are the gatekeepers.

642
00:55:41,432 --> 00:55:44,266
They're guarding all the doors
and holding all the keys.

643
00:55:44,512 --> 00:55:47,231
Sooner or later, someone will
have to fight them.

644
00:55:47,592 --> 00:55:48,547
Someone?

645
00:55:48,873 --> 00:55:50,226
I won't lie to you, Neo.

646
00:55:50,672 --> 00:55:55,302
Every single man or woman who
has fought an agent has died.

647
00:55:55,552 --> 00:55:57,827
But where they have failed,
you will succeed.

648
00:55:58,233 --> 00:55:59,028
Why?

649
00:55:59,273 --> 00:56:01,467
I've seen an agent punch
through a concrete wall.

650
00:56:01,713 --> 00:56:05,148
Men have emptied entire clips at them
and hit nothing but air.

651
00:56:05,393 --> 00:56:09,829
Yet their strength and speed are still
based in a world built on rules.

652
00:56:10,072 --> 00:56:11,141
Because of that...

653
00:56:11,393 --> 00:56:14,623
...they will never be as strong
or as fast as you can be.

654
00:56:18,753 --> 00:56:20,550
What are you telling me?

655
00:56:21,233 --> 00:56:22,632
That I can dodge bullets?

656
00:56:24,552 --> 00:56:25,871
No, Neo.

657
00:56:26,353 --> 00:56:29,150
I'm trying to tell you
that when you're ready...

658
00:56:29,992 --> 00:56:31,311
...you won't have to.

659
00:56:35,632 --> 00:56:36,429
<i>We got trouble.</i>

660
00:56:54,552 --> 00:56:55,871
Did Zion send the warning?

661
00:56:56,112 --> 00:56:56,909
No, another ship.

662
00:57:00,032 --> 00:57:01,260
Shit.

663
00:57:01,512 --> 00:57:03,184
Squiddy's sweeping in quick.

664
00:57:03,472 --> 00:57:04,268
Squiddy?

665
00:57:04,472 --> 00:57:07,545
A sentinel. A killing machine
designed for one thing.

666
00:57:07,793 --> 00:57:08,942
Search and destroy.

667
00:57:10,233 --> 00:57:11,347
Set her down there.

668
00:57:32,273 --> 00:57:33,182
How are we doing, Tank?

669
00:57:41,552 --> 00:57:42,668
Power off-line.

670
00:57:43,152 --> 00:57:45,063
EMP armed...

671
00:57:45,552 --> 00:57:47,032
...and ready.

672
00:57:47,313 --> 00:57:49,110
Electromagnetic pulse.

673
00:57:49,353 --> 00:57:52,106
Disables any electrical system
in the blast radius.

674
00:57:52,353 --> 00:57:54,469
It's the only weapon we have
against the machines.

675
00:58:00,032 --> 00:58:00,829
Where are we?

676
00:58:01,072 --> 00:58:03,028
Their old service and waste systems.

677
00:58:04,512 --> 00:58:05,309
Sewers.

678
00:58:05,512 --> 00:58:08,106
There used to be cities
that spanned hundreds of miles.

679
00:58:08,592 --> 00:58:10,423
Now these sewers are
all that's left.

680
00:58:10,672 --> 00:58:11,947
Quiet.

681
00:58:54,012 --> 00:58:56,081
You scared the bejesus out of me.

682
00:58:57,132 --> 00:58:58,963
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

683
00:59:01,771 --> 00:59:02,568
Is that...?

684
00:59:02,811 --> 00:59:04,324
The Matrix?

685
00:59:07,371 --> 00:59:10,409
- Do you always look at it encoded?
- Well, you have to.

686
00:59:10,652 --> 00:59:13,610
The image translators work
for the construct program.

687
00:59:13,851 --> 00:59:17,128
But there's way too much information
to decode the Matrix.

688
00:59:17,371 --> 00:59:20,204
You get used to it.
I don't even see the code.

689
00:59:20,452 --> 00:59:23,728
All I see is blonde, brunette, redhead.

690
00:59:24,851 --> 00:59:26,170
Do you...

691
00:59:26,452 --> 00:59:27,487
...want a drink?

692
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:28,721
Sure.

693
00:59:32,132 --> 00:59:33,530
You know...

694
00:59:34,411 --> 00:59:35,891
...I know what you're thinking.

695
00:59:36,132 --> 00:59:38,168
Because right now I'm thinking
the same thing.

696
00:59:38,452 --> 00:59:41,648
Actually, I've been thinking it
ever since I got here.

697
00:59:43,492 --> 00:59:46,369
Why, oh, why didn't I take
the blue pill?

698
00:59:58,251 --> 01:00:00,083
Good shit, huh?

699
01:00:00,411 --> 01:00:01,561
Dozer makes it.

700
01:00:02,012 --> 01:00:03,126
It's good for two things:

701
01:00:03,371 --> 01:00:06,329
Degreasing engines and
killing brain cells.

702
01:00:07,291 --> 01:00:09,407
So can I ask you something?

703
01:00:12,291 --> 01:00:13,849
Did he tell you why he did it?

704
01:00:16,371 --> 01:00:18,123
Why you're here?

705
01:00:21,652 --> 01:00:23,324
Jesus!

706
01:00:24,492 --> 01:00:26,322
What a mind job.

707
01:00:27,692 --> 01:00:30,364
So you're here to save the world.

708
01:00:31,811 --> 01:00:33,802
What do you say
to something like that?

709
01:00:38,771 --> 01:00:40,090
A little piece of advice.

710
01:00:41,811 --> 01:00:43,164
You see an agent...

711
01:00:43,492 --> 01:00:45,686
...you do what we do:

712
01:00:46,012 --> 01:00:47,490
Run.

713
01:00:47,811 --> 01:00:49,483
You run your ass off.

714
01:00:56,452 --> 01:00:58,090
Thanks for the drink.

715
01:01:02,612 --> 01:01:03,726
Sweet dreams.

716
01:01:07,572 --> 01:01:10,847
Do we have a deal, Mr. Reagan?

717
01:01:11,492 --> 01:01:12,561
You know...

718
01:01:13,931 --> 01:01:16,286
...I know this steak doesn't exist.

719
01:01:17,251 --> 01:01:19,891
I know that when I put it
in my mouth...

720
01:01:20,132 --> 01:01:23,090
...the Matrix is telling my brain
that it is...

721
01:01:23,371 --> 01:01:24,440
...juicy...

722
01:01:24,731 --> 01:01:26,369
...and delicious.

723
01:01:29,172 --> 01:01:30,365
After nine years...

724
01:01:31,371 --> 01:01:32,851
...you know what I realize?

725
01:01:40,371 --> 01:01:41,521
Ignorance is bliss.

726
01:01:46,371 --> 01:01:48,123
Then we have a deal.

727
01:01:50,532 --> 01:01:52,362
I don't want to remember nothing.

728
01:01:52,612 --> 01:01:53,407
Nothing.

729
01:01:53,931 --> 01:01:55,047
You understand?

730
01:01:58,931 --> 01:02:00,650
And I want to be rich.

731
01:02:01,931 --> 01:02:04,525
You know, someone important.

732
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:07,041
Like an actor.

733
01:02:08,211 --> 01:02:11,204
Whatever you want, Mr. Reagan.

734
01:02:13,291 --> 01:02:14,771
Okay.

735
01:02:15,132 --> 01:02:17,440
You get my body
back in a power plant...

736
01:02:17,811 --> 01:02:19,483
...reinsert me into the Matrix...

737
01:02:19,811 --> 01:02:21,164
...I'll get you what you want.

738
01:02:21,411 --> 01:02:23,322
Access codes to the Zion mainframe.

739
01:02:23,572 --> 01:02:25,641
No. I told you, I don't know them.

740
01:02:28,492 --> 01:02:30,402
I can get you the man who does.

741
01:02:31,132 --> 01:02:32,849
Morpheus.

742
01:02:42,532 --> 01:02:45,842
Here you go, buddy.
Breakfast of champions.

743
01:02:47,132 --> 01:02:49,804
Close your eyes, it feels
like you're eating runny eggs.

744
01:02:50,052 --> 01:02:50,847
Or a bowl of snot.

745
01:02:52,172 --> 01:02:53,684
You know what it reminds me of?

746
01:02:55,452 --> 01:02:57,681
Tastee Wheat. Did you
ever eat Tastee Wheat?

747
01:02:58,291 --> 01:02:59,929
No, but technically,
neither did you.

748
01:03:00,172 --> 01:03:02,128
That's exactly my point. Exactly.

749
01:03:02,371 --> 01:03:03,690
Because you have to wonder...

750
01:03:03,931 --> 01:03:07,048
...how do the machines really know
what Tastee Wheat tasted like?

751
01:03:07,291 --> 01:03:08,644
Maybe they got it wrong.

752
01:03:08,891 --> 01:03:11,963
Maybe what I think Tastee Wheat
tasted like actually tasted like...

753
01:03:12,251 --> 01:03:14,163
...oatmeal or tuna fish.

754
01:03:14,532 --> 01:03:17,251
That makes you wonder.
Take chicken, for example.

755
01:03:17,492 --> 01:03:19,402
Maybe they didn't know
what to make it taste like...

756
01:03:19,652 --> 01:03:21,608
...which is why it tastes
like everything.

757
01:03:21,851 --> 01:03:23,570
- And maybe they...
- Shut up.

758
01:03:25,132 --> 01:03:26,530
It's a single-celled protein...

759
01:03:26,771 --> 01:03:29,684
...combined with synthetic aminos,
vitamins and minerals.

760
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:31,126
Everything the body needs.

761
01:03:31,371 --> 01:03:34,125
It doesn't have everything
the body needs.

762
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:39,730
I understand you've run through
the agent training program.

763
01:03:40,731 --> 01:03:42,688
You know, I wrote that program.

764
01:03:42,972 --> 01:03:44,199
Here it comes.

765
01:03:44,452 --> 01:03:46,329
- What did you think of her?
- Of who?

766
01:03:46,692 --> 01:03:49,603
The woman in the red dress.
I designed her.

767
01:03:49,931 --> 01:03:52,570
She doesn't talk very much...

768
01:03:52,811 --> 01:03:56,599
...but if you'd like to meet her,
I can arrange a more personal milieu.

769
01:03:56,851 --> 01:03:58,170
The digital pimp hard at work.

770
01:03:58,411 --> 01:04:00,561
Pay no attention to
these hypocrites, Neo.

771
01:04:01,811 --> 01:04:03,563
To deny our own impulses...

772
01:04:03,811 --> 01:04:06,804
...is to deny the very thing
that makes us human.

773
01:04:08,652 --> 01:04:09,971
Dozer, when you're done...

774
01:04:10,211 --> 01:04:11,565
...bring the ship up to broadcast depth.

775
01:04:12,251 --> 01:04:13,525
We're going in.

776
01:04:14,211 --> 01:04:15,565
I'm taking Neo to see her.

777
01:04:19,731 --> 01:04:20,527
See who?

778
01:04:21,492 --> 01:04:22,686
The Oracle.

779
01:04:27,972 --> 01:04:29,451
Everyone, please observe...

780
01:04:29,771 --> 01:04:32,365
...the "fasten seat belt"
and "no smoking" signs are on.

781
01:04:32,851 --> 01:04:36,083
Sit back and enjoy your flight.

782
01:04:59,612 --> 01:05:00,407
We're in.

783
01:05:15,492 --> 01:05:16,561
We'll be back in an hour.

784
01:05:30,771 --> 01:05:32,125
Unbelievable...

785
01:05:32,931 --> 01:05:34,206
...isn't it?

786
01:05:37,652 --> 01:05:39,403
- God!
- What?

787
01:05:40,052 --> 01:05:41,371
I used to eat there.

788
01:05:43,532 --> 01:05:45,090
Really good noodles.

789
01:05:49,692 --> 01:05:52,081
I have these memories from my life.

790
01:05:54,452 --> 01:05:56,043
None of them happened.

791
01:05:57,052 --> 01:05:57,927
What does that mean?

792
01:05:58,172 --> 01:06:00,288
That the Matrix cannot tell you
who you are.

793
01:06:01,172 --> 01:06:02,320
But an oracle can?

794
01:06:02,771 --> 01:06:03,920
That's different.

795
01:06:08,811 --> 01:06:09,641
Did you go to her?

796
01:06:11,132 --> 01:06:12,246
Yes.

797
01:06:12,731 --> 01:06:14,050
What did she tell you?

798
01:06:17,172 --> 01:06:18,605
She told me...

799
01:06:19,612 --> 01:06:20,726
What?

800
01:06:24,371 --> 01:06:25,646
We're here.

801
01:06:26,851 --> 01:06:28,204
Come with me.

802
01:06:47,371 --> 01:06:49,931
So is this the same oracle
that made...

803
01:06:50,251 --> 01:06:51,047
...the prophecy?

804
01:06:51,291 --> 01:06:55,443
Yes. She's very old. She's been
with us since the beginning.

805
01:06:55,891 --> 01:06:56,688
The beginning?

806
01:06:56,891 --> 01:06:57,802
Of the Resistance.

807
01:06:59,972 --> 01:07:02,246
And she knows what? Everything?

808
01:07:04,211 --> 01:07:06,043
She would say she knows enough.

809
01:07:07,132 --> 01:07:08,849
And she's never wrong.

810
01:07:10,972 --> 01:07:14,009
Try not to think of it
in terms of right and wrong.

811
01:07:14,331 --> 01:07:15,844
She is a guide, Neo.

812
01:07:16,211 --> 01:07:18,009
She can help you to find the path.

813
01:07:18,771 --> 01:07:19,681
She helped you?

814
01:07:22,092 --> 01:07:23,365
What did she tell you?

815
01:07:25,731 --> 01:07:27,847
That I would find the One.

816
01:07:40,452 --> 01:07:42,487
I told you I can only
show you the door.

817
01:07:43,172 --> 01:07:45,163
You have to walk through it.

818
01:07:48,811 --> 01:07:49,847
Hello, Neo.

819
01:07:50,092 --> 01:07:51,684
You're right on time.

820
01:07:59,291 --> 01:08:02,920
Make yourself at home, Morpheus.
Neo, come with me.

821
01:08:08,371 --> 01:08:09,885
These are the other Potentials.

822
01:08:10,132 --> 01:08:11,610
You can wait here.

823
01:08:50,771 --> 01:08:53,206
Do not try and bend the spoon.

824
01:08:53,572 --> 01:08:55,608
That's impossible.

825
01:08:56,412 --> 01:09:00,246
Instead, only try
to realize the truth.

826
01:09:00,771 --> 01:09:02,091
What truth?

827
01:09:02,332 --> 01:09:03,923
There is no spoon.

828
01:09:06,412 --> 01:09:07,685
There is no spoon?

829
01:09:07,931 --> 01:09:12,243
Then you'll see that it is not the spoon
that bends. It is only yourself.

830
01:09:27,612 --> 01:09:29,045
The Oracle will you see now.

831
01:09:39,292 --> 01:09:40,770
I know you're Neo.

832
01:09:41,372 --> 01:09:42,487
Be right with you.

833
01:09:43,492 --> 01:09:44,447
You're the Oracle?

834
01:09:44,811 --> 01:09:45,766
Bingo.

835
01:09:48,372 --> 01:09:51,125
Not quite what you
were expecting, right?

836
01:09:52,131 --> 01:09:54,202
Almost done.

837
01:09:56,612 --> 01:09:58,170
Smell good, don't they?

838
01:10:00,811 --> 01:10:02,564
I'd ask you to sit down...

839
01:10:02,811 --> 01:10:05,087
...but you're not going to anyway.

840
01:10:05,572 --> 01:10:07,323
And don't worry about the vase.

841
01:10:07,532 --> 01:10:08,328
What vase?

842
01:10:11,332 --> 01:10:12,447
That vase.

843
01:10:13,372 --> 01:10:14,360
I'm sorry.

844
01:10:14,612 --> 01:10:16,408
I said, don't worry about it.

845
01:10:17,532 --> 01:10:19,408
I'll get one of my kids to fix it.

846
01:10:20,011 --> 01:10:21,161
How did you know?

847
01:10:23,131 --> 01:10:26,761
What's really going to bake
your noodle later on is...

848
01:10:27,091 --> 01:10:29,925
...would you still have broken it
if I hadn't said anything?

849
01:10:34,532 --> 01:10:36,363
You're cuter than I thought.

850
01:10:39,292 --> 01:10:41,442
I can see why she likes you.

851
01:10:42,292 --> 01:10:43,327
Who?

852
01:10:43,572 --> 01:10:45,323
Not too bright, though.

853
01:10:48,492 --> 01:10:51,449
You know why Morpheus
brought you to see me.

854
01:10:53,492 --> 01:10:54,606
So...

855
01:10:55,532 --> 01:10:56,850
...what do you think?

856
01:10:58,612 --> 01:11:00,283
Do you think you are the One?

857
01:11:02,171 --> 01:11:03,161
I don't know.

858
01:11:06,452 --> 01:11:07,805
You know what that means?

859
01:11:08,612 --> 01:11:09,726
It's Latin.

860
01:11:10,091 --> 01:11:12,207
Means, "Know thyself."

861
01:11:13,612 --> 01:11:15,488
I'll let you in on a little secret.

862
01:11:17,652 --> 01:11:21,327
Being the One is just
like being in love.

863
01:11:22,011 --> 01:11:24,765
No one can tell you you're in love.
You just know it...

864
01:11:25,011 --> 01:11:26,081
...through and through.

865
01:11:26,412 --> 01:11:28,368
Balls to bones.

866
01:11:30,811 --> 01:11:31,608
Well...

867
01:11:33,492 --> 01:11:35,483
...I'd better have a look at you.

868
01:11:36,771 --> 01:11:38,204
Open your mouth. Say, "Ah."

869
01:11:52,011 --> 01:11:53,604
Okay...

870
01:11:54,212 --> 01:11:58,966
Now I'm supposed to say,
"Hmm, that's interesting, but..."

871
01:11:59,452 --> 01:12:00,520
Then you say:

872
01:12:01,372 --> 01:12:02,327
But what?

873
01:12:02,572 --> 01:12:06,359
But you already know
what I'm going to tell you.

874
01:12:07,731 --> 01:12:08,686
I'm not the One.

875
01:12:08,931 --> 01:12:10,569
Sorry, kid.

876
01:12:12,131 --> 01:12:14,042
You got the gift...

877
01:12:15,011 --> 01:12:17,127
...but it looks like
you're waiting for something.

878
01:12:21,811 --> 01:12:22,608
What?

879
01:12:22,811 --> 01:12:25,609
Your next life, maybe. Who knows?

880
01:12:26,171 --> 01:12:28,322
That's the way these things go.

881
01:12:29,171 --> 01:12:30,002
What's funny?

882
01:12:30,372 --> 01:12:31,645
Morpheus.

883
01:12:34,971 --> 01:12:36,609
He almost had me convinced.

884
01:12:36,851 --> 01:12:37,921
I know.

885
01:12:39,412 --> 01:12:41,448
Poor Morpheus.

886
01:12:43,731 --> 01:12:46,724
Without him, we're lost.

887
01:12:48,212 --> 01:12:50,282
What do you mean, "without him"?

888
01:12:54,131 --> 01:12:55,962
Are you sure you want
to hear this?

889
01:12:58,091 --> 01:13:00,730
Morpheus believes in you, Neo.

890
01:13:02,372 --> 01:13:04,442
And no one, not you, not even me...

891
01:13:04,692 --> 01:13:06,841
...can convince him otherwise.

892
01:13:07,212 --> 01:13:09,487
He believes it so blindly...

893
01:13:09,771 --> 01:13:13,923
...that he's going to sacrifice
his life to save yours.

894
01:13:14,171 --> 01:13:14,967
What?

895
01:13:15,171 --> 01:13:17,970
You're going to
have to make a choice.

896
01:13:18,572 --> 01:13:22,007
In the one hand,
you'll have Morpheus' life.

897
01:13:22,492 --> 01:13:25,244
And in the other hand,
you'll have your own.

898
01:13:26,612 --> 01:13:28,806
One of you is going to die.

899
01:13:30,811 --> 01:13:33,962
Which one will be up to you.

900
01:13:35,292 --> 01:13:37,122
I'm sorry, kiddo. I really am.

901
01:13:37,372 --> 01:13:38,963
You have a good soul.

902
01:13:40,011 --> 01:13:42,605
And I hate giving
good people bad news.

903
01:13:45,612 --> 01:13:47,011
Don't worry about it.

904
01:13:47,252 --> 01:13:49,560
As soon as you
step outside that door...

905
01:13:49,811 --> 01:13:51,847
...you'll start feeling better.

906
01:13:52,532 --> 01:13:56,161
You'll remember you don't believe
in any of this fate crap.

907
01:13:56,971 --> 01:13:59,610
You're in control of your own life.

908
01:14:00,412 --> 01:14:01,640
Remember?

909
01:14:03,452 --> 01:14:04,407
Here...

910
01:14:06,212 --> 01:14:07,690
...take a cookie.

911
01:14:08,212 --> 01:14:11,408
I promise, by the time
you're done eating it...

912
01:14:12,332 --> 01:14:14,606
...you'll feel right as rain.

913
01:14:23,452 --> 01:14:24,725
What was said...

914
01:14:25,332 --> 01:14:26,730
...was for you...

915
01:14:27,252 --> 01:14:29,003
...and for you alone.

916
01:14:51,011 --> 01:14:52,081
They're on the way.

917
01:15:20,851 --> 01:15:21,648
What is that?

918
01:15:35,811 --> 01:15:37,164
Oh, déjŕ vu.

919
01:15:40,532 --> 01:15:41,567
What did you just say?

920
01:15:41,811 --> 01:15:43,244
Nothing.
Just déjŕ vu.

921
01:15:43,492 --> 01:15:45,050
- What did you see?
- What happened?

922
01:15:46,412 --> 01:15:48,481
A black cat went past us...

923
01:15:48,731 --> 01:15:50,289
...then another just like it.

924
01:15:50,532 --> 01:15:52,011
Was it the same cat?

925
01:15:53,131 --> 01:15:54,087
I'm not sure.

926
01:15:54,851 --> 01:15:55,648
Switch, Apoc.

927
01:15:59,931 --> 01:16:00,728
What is it?

928
01:16:00,971 --> 01:16:05,203
A déjŕ vu is usually a glitch in the
Matrix when they change something.

929
01:16:08,452 --> 01:16:09,247
Oh, my God.

930
01:16:11,011 --> 01:16:11,921
Let's go.

931
01:16:16,971 --> 01:16:18,644
They cut the hard line.
It's a trap! Get out!

932
01:16:24,332 --> 01:16:25,127
Oh, no.

933
01:17:03,764 --> 01:17:06,118
That's what they changed.
We're trapped.

934
01:17:06,363 --> 01:17:08,161
Be calm. Give me your phone.

935
01:17:08,404 --> 01:17:09,882
They'll be able to track it.

936
01:17:10,123 --> 01:17:11,476
We have no choice.

937
01:17:12,844 --> 01:17:13,993
Operator.

938
01:17:14,323 --> 01:17:17,042
<i>Find a structural drawing of
this building. Find it fast.</i>

939
01:17:24,564 --> 01:17:27,032
<i>- Got it!
- I need the main wet-wall.</i>

940
01:17:30,163 --> 01:17:30,960
Eighth floor.

941
01:17:31,163 --> 01:17:32,676
<i>They're on the eighth floor.</i>

942
01:17:32,963 --> 01:17:34,363
Switch, straight ahead.

943
01:17:42,083 --> 01:17:44,234
I hope the Oracle
gave you some good news.

944
01:17:52,083 --> 01:17:53,516
<i>Now left. That's it.</i>

945
01:17:53,804 --> 01:17:54,792
Good.

946
01:18:04,123 --> 01:18:05,351
Where are they?

947
01:19:03,323 --> 01:19:04,439
They're in the walls.

948
01:19:05,844 --> 01:19:06,958
In the walls!

949
01:19:27,484 --> 01:19:28,279
It's an agent!

950
01:19:37,684 --> 01:19:38,639
You must get Neo out!

951
01:19:38,963 --> 01:19:40,716
He's all that matters!

952
01:19:41,003 --> 01:19:42,153
No, Morpheus! Don't!

953
01:19:42,404 --> 01:19:43,199
Trinity, go!

954
01:19:44,043 --> 01:19:45,363
Go!

955
01:19:51,323 --> 01:19:53,154
- We can't leave him!
- We have to!

956
01:20:17,404 --> 01:20:18,199
Come on!

957
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:25,038
The great Morpheus.
We meet at last.

958
01:20:27,119 --> 01:20:28,189
And you are?

959
01:20:28,439 --> 01:20:30,112
A Smith.

960
01:20:30,359 --> 01:20:31,587
Agent Smith.

961
01:20:32,159 --> 01:20:34,115
You all look the same to me.

962
01:21:21,199 --> 01:21:22,427
Take him.

963
01:21:35,119 --> 01:21:36,872
<i>- Operator.
- I need an exit, fast.</i>

964
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:41,677
There was an accident.
Goddamn car accident.

965
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,717
<i>All of a sudden, boom.</i>

966
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:45,279
Somebody up there still likes me.

967
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:46,713
I got you.

968
01:21:47,199 --> 01:21:49,030
<i>Just get me out of here fast.</i>

969
01:21:49,279 --> 01:21:51,840
Nearest exit, Franklin and Erie.
An old TV repair shop.

970
01:21:52,079 --> 01:21:53,069
Right.

971
01:21:56,079 --> 01:21:57,592
<i>- Operator.
- Tank, it's me.</i>

972
01:21:57,840 --> 01:21:58,954
Is Morpheus alive?

973
01:21:59,319 --> 01:22:00,547
Is Morpheus alive, Tank?

974
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:02,791
<i>Yes. They're moving him.
I don 't know where.</i>

975
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,194
He's alive. We need an exit.

976
01:22:05,439 --> 01:22:06,315
You're not far from Cypher.

977
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:07,833
<i>- Cypher?
- I know.</i>

978
01:22:08,079 --> 01:22:10,070
<i>- I sent him to Franklin and Erie.
- Got it.</i>

979
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:19,948
Got him.

980
01:22:30,439 --> 01:22:31,429
Where are they?

981
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:32,873
Making the call.

982
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:34,635
Good.

983
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:48,435
You first.

984
01:22:51,479 --> 01:22:52,275
Shit!

985
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,069
I don't know. It just went dead.

986
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:29,948
<i>Hello, Trinity.</i>

987
01:23:30,359 --> 01:23:31,634
Cypher? Where's Tank?

988
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:37,988
You know...

989
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:41,676
...for a long time...

990
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:45,637
...I thought I was in love with you.

991
01:23:46,359 --> 01:23:48,315
<i>I used to dream about you.</i>

992
01:23:49,359 --> 01:23:51,953
You're a beautiful woman, Trinity.

993
01:23:52,199 --> 01:23:54,475
<i>Too bad things had to
turn out this way.</i>

994
01:23:55,199 --> 01:23:55,996
You killed them.

995
01:23:56,479 --> 01:23:57,912
- What?
- Oh, God.

996
01:23:58,159 --> 01:23:59,512
I'm tired, Trinity.

997
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:02,676
I'm tired of this war...

998
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:05,679
...tired of fighting.
I'm tired of this ship...

999
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:10,436
...of being cold, of eating
the same goddamn goop every day.

1000
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:13,636
But most of all...

1001
01:24:14,199 --> 01:24:17,430
<i>... I'm tired of that jackoff
and all of his bullshit.</i>

1002
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:19,747
Surprise, asshole!

1003
01:24:20,279 --> 01:24:22,395
I bet you never saw this coming...

1004
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:23,628
...did you?

1005
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:28,114
God, I wish I could be there...

1006
01:24:28,680 --> 01:24:30,113
...when they break you.

1007
01:24:31,119 --> 01:24:34,157
I wish I could walk in
just when it happens...

1008
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:36,478
...so right then...

1009
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:37,993
...you'd know it was me.

1010
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:39,590
You gave them Morpheus.

1011
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:41,238
<i>He lied to us, Trinity.</i>

1012
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:43,233
He tricked us!

1013
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:45,671
If you had told us the truth...

1014
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:48,672
...we would've told you to shove
that red pill up your ass!

1015
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:50,956
That is not true, Cypher.
He set us free.

1016
01:24:51,199 --> 01:24:52,076
<i>"Free."</i>

1017
01:24:52,319 --> 01:24:53,957
You call this free?

1018
01:24:56,279 --> 01:24:58,668
All I do is what he tells me to do.

1019
01:25:00,199 --> 01:25:02,997
If I had to choose between
that and the Matrix...

1020
01:25:04,119 --> 01:25:05,269
...I choose the Matrix.

1021
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:07,112
The Matrix isn't real.

1022
01:25:07,359 --> 01:25:08,712
<i>I disagree, Trinity.</i>

1023
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:11,109
I think the Matrix...

1024
01:25:11,439 --> 01:25:13,908
...can be more real than this world.

1025
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,389
All I do is pull the plug here.

1026
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:19,914
But there...

1027
01:25:20,439 --> 01:25:22,635
<i>... you have to watch Apoc die.</i>

1028
01:25:30,079 --> 01:25:31,717
<i>Welcome to the real world.</i>

1029
01:25:32,039 --> 01:25:32,916
But you're out.

1030
01:25:33,159 --> 01:25:35,469
<i>- You can 't go back.
- That's what you think.</i>

1031
01:25:35,720 --> 01:25:37,153
<i>They'll reinsert my body.</i>

1032
01:25:37,399 --> 01:25:40,869
<i>I go back to sleep. When I wake up,
I won 't remember a thing.</i>

1033
01:25:41,119 --> 01:25:42,074
By the way...

1034
01:25:42,319 --> 01:25:45,153
...if you have anything important
to say to Switch...

1035
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:46,675
<i>... say it now.</i>

1036
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:47,750
No, please don't.

1037
01:25:48,279 --> 01:25:49,837
Not like this.

1038
01:25:51,479 --> 01:25:53,037
Not like this.

1039
01:25:57,319 --> 01:25:58,309
Too late.

1040
01:25:58,680 --> 01:26:00,271
Goddamn you, Cypher!

1041
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:02,317
Don't hate me, Trinity.

1042
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:04,476
I'm just a messenger.

1043
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:07,917
And right now,
I'm going to prove it to you.

1044
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:10,551
If Morpheus was right...

1045
01:26:11,079 --> 01:26:12,877
...there's no way
I can pull this plug.

1046
01:26:13,439 --> 01:26:14,872
<i>If Neo 's the One...</i>

1047
01:26:15,359 --> 01:26:17,112
<i>... then there'd have to be...</i>

1048
01:26:17,359 --> 01:26:19,828
...some kind of a miracle to stop me.

1049
01:26:20,319 --> 01:26:21,149
Right?

1050
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:23,829
I mean, how can he be the One...

1051
01:26:24,119 --> 01:26:24,949
...if he's dead?

1052
01:26:26,279 --> 01:26:28,430
<i>You never did answer me before...</i>

1053
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:30,949
<i>... if you bought into
Morpheus ' bullshit.</i>

1054
01:26:31,319 --> 01:26:34,391
Come on. All I want
is a little yes or no.

1055
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:37,949
Look into his eyes...

1056
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:40,113
<i>... those big, pretty eyes...</i>

1057
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:44,033
...and tell me...

1058
01:26:44,720 --> 01:26:45,948
<i>... yes...</i>

1059
01:26:46,239 --> 01:26:47,559
<i>... or no.</i>

1060
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:49,868
Yes.

1061
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:51,555
I don't believe it.

1062
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:57,470
Believe it or not, you piece of shit,
you're still going to burn!

1063
01:27:15,399 --> 01:27:16,310
You first.

1064
01:27:24,199 --> 01:27:25,029
You're hurt.

1065
01:27:25,359 --> 01:27:26,395
I'll be all right.

1066
01:27:29,079 --> 01:27:30,194
Dozer?

1067
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:49,994
Have you ever stood and stared at it?

1068
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:53,832
Marveled at its beauty...

1069
01:27:54,199 --> 01:27:56,350
...its genius?

1070
01:27:57,479 --> 01:27:59,277
Billions of people...

1071
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:02,158
...just living out their lives.

1072
01:28:03,159 --> 01:28:04,752
Oblivious.

1073
01:28:09,159 --> 01:28:11,912
Did you know that the first Matrix...

1074
01:28:12,159 --> 01:28:16,676
...was designed to be a perfect
human world where none suffered...

1075
01:28:17,119 --> 01:28:19,917
...where everyone would be happy.

1076
01:28:20,439 --> 01:28:21,872
It was a disaster.

1077
01:28:22,119 --> 01:28:26,271
No one would accept the program.
Entire crops were lost.

1078
01:28:27,119 --> 01:28:28,792
Some believe that...

1079
01:28:29,039 --> 01:28:33,238
...we lacked the programming language
to describe your perfect world.

1080
01:28:33,479 --> 01:28:34,958
But I believe that...

1081
01:28:35,359 --> 01:28:36,235
...as a species...

1082
01:28:36,479 --> 01:28:40,154
...human beings define
their reality through misery...

1083
01:28:40,399 --> 01:28:41,719
...and suffering.

1084
01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:44,554
So the perfect world was a dream...

1085
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:49,430
...that your primitive cerebrum
kept trying to wake up from.

1086
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:54,234
Which is why the Matrix was
redesigned to this.

1087
01:28:54,680 --> 01:28:56,113
The peak...

1088
01:28:56,359 --> 01:28:57,712
...of your civilization.

1089
01:28:57,960 --> 01:29:00,109
I say, "your civilization"...

1090
01:29:00,359 --> 01:29:04,319
...because when we started thinking
for you, it became our civilization...

1091
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:07,518
...which is, of course,
what this is all about.

1092
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:11,268
Evolution, Morpheus.

1093
01:29:11,560 --> 01:29:12,833
Evolution.

1094
01:29:15,039 --> 01:29:16,837
Like the dinosaur.

1095
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:20,478
Look out that window.

1096
01:29:21,159 --> 01:29:23,195
You had your time.

1097
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:27,634
The future is our world, Morpheus.

1098
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:30,234
The future is our time.

1099
01:29:34,319 --> 01:29:35,389
There could be a problem.

1100
01:29:36,319 --> 01:29:39,551
- What are they doing to him?
- They're breaking into his mind.

1101
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:41,869
It's like hacking a computer.
All it takes is time.

1102
01:29:42,119 --> 01:29:43,269
How much time?

1103
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:46,511
Depends on the mind.
But eventually, it'll crack...

1104
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:50,992
...and his alpha patterns
will change from this to this.

1105
01:29:51,239 --> 01:29:54,073
When it does, he'll tell them
anything they want to know.

1106
01:29:54,319 --> 01:29:55,309
What do they want?

1107
01:29:55,560 --> 01:29:59,439
The leader of every ship is given codes
to Zion's mainframe computer.

1108
01:29:59,680 --> 01:30:02,478
If an agent got the codes
and got into Zion's mainframe...

1109
01:30:02,720 --> 01:30:05,677
...they could destroy us.
We can't let that happen.

1110
01:30:06,479 --> 01:30:07,993
Zion's more important than me...

1111
01:30:08,239 --> 01:30:09,115
...or you...

1112
01:30:09,439 --> 01:30:10,667
...or even Morpheus.

1113
01:30:14,319 --> 01:30:15,912
There has to be
something we can do.

1114
01:30:16,319 --> 01:30:18,230
There is. We pull the plug.

1115
01:30:21,199 --> 01:30:22,872
You're going to kill him?

1116
01:30:23,119 --> 01:30:24,234
Kill Morpheus?

1117
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:26,398
We don't have a choice.

1118
01:30:32,920 --> 01:30:35,717
Never send a human
to do a machine's job.

1119
01:30:35,960 --> 01:30:37,631
If the insider has failed...

1120
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:40,952
...they'll sever the connection
as soon as possible, unless...

1121
01:30:41,199 --> 01:30:42,837
They're dead. In either case...

1122
01:30:43,079 --> 01:30:46,470
We have no choice. Continue as planned.
Deploy the sentinels.

1123
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:47,755
Immediately.

1124
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:55,359
Morpheus, you were more
than a leader to us.

1125
01:30:56,279 --> 01:30:58,395
You were a father.

1126
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:01,756
We'll miss you always.

1127
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:09,515
Stop!

1128
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:11,828
I don't believe this is happening.

1129
01:31:12,079 --> 01:31:14,036
- Neo, this has to be done.
- Does it?

1130
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:16,118
I don't know.

1131
01:31:16,439 --> 01:31:17,918
This can't be just coincidence.

1132
01:31:18,119 --> 01:31:18,916
What?

1133
01:31:19,399 --> 01:31:20,195
The Oracle.

1134
01:31:20,439 --> 01:31:22,158
She told me this would happen.

1135
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:26,552
She told me that I would
have to make a choice.

1136
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,194
What choice?

1137
01:31:31,039 --> 01:31:31,869
What are you doing?

1138
01:31:32,279 --> 01:31:33,429
I'm going in.

1139
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:34,953
No, you're not.

1140
01:31:35,199 --> 01:31:35,996
I have to.

1141
01:31:36,199 --> 01:31:39,670
Neo, Morpheus sacrificed himself
so that we could get you out.

1142
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:41,751
There is no way
that you're going back in.

1143
01:31:42,319 --> 01:31:45,436
Morpheus did what he did because
he believed I'm something I'm not.

1144
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:50,118
I'm not the One, Trinity.

1145
01:31:50,479 --> 01:31:53,313
- The Oracle hit me with that too.
- No, you have to be.

1146
01:31:53,560 --> 01:31:56,119
I'm sorry, I'm not.
I'm just another guy.

1147
01:31:56,760 --> 01:31:57,953
No, Neo, that's not true.

1148
01:31:58,520 --> 01:31:59,793
It can't be true.

1149
01:32:00,119 --> 01:32:01,029
Why?

1150
01:32:05,279 --> 01:32:08,476
This is loco. They've got Morpheus
in a military-controlled building.

1151
01:32:08,720 --> 01:32:12,917
Even if you somehow got inside, those
are agents holding him. Three of them.

1152
01:32:14,159 --> 01:32:17,913
I want Morpheus back too, but
what you're talking about is suicide.

1153
01:32:18,159 --> 01:32:19,717
That's what it looks like...

1154
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:20,836
...but it's not.

1155
01:32:21,079 --> 01:32:23,354
I can't explain to you why it's not.

1156
01:32:24,399 --> 01:32:27,948
Morpheus believed something, and
he was ready to give his life for it.

1157
01:32:28,199 --> 01:32:31,078
I understand that now.
That's why I have to go.

1158
01:32:31,319 --> 01:32:32,115
Why?

1159
01:32:32,359 --> 01:32:33,759
Because I believe in something.

1160
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:34,756
What?

1161
01:32:36,159 --> 01:32:37,797
I believe I can bring him back.

1162
01:32:54,079 --> 01:32:55,911
- What are you doing?
- Going with you.

1163
01:32:56,199 --> 01:32:57,029
No, you're not.

1164
01:32:57,279 --> 01:32:58,109
"No"?

1165
01:32:59,239 --> 01:33:01,275
Let me tell you what I believe.

1166
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:04,034
Morpheus means more to me
than he does to you.

1167
01:33:04,359 --> 01:33:08,478
I believe if you are serious about
saving him, you will need my help.

1168
01:33:08,720 --> 01:33:10,676
And since I am the ranking officer...

1169
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:13,672
...if you don't like it,
I believe you can go to hell.

1170
01:33:14,399 --> 01:33:16,708
Because you aren't going anywhere else.

1171
01:33:17,119 --> 01:33:17,916
Tank...

1172
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:19,875
...Ioad us up.

1173
01:33:29,079 --> 01:33:32,230
I'd like to share
a revelation that I've had...

1174
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:34,118
...during my time here.

1175
01:33:34,359 --> 01:33:38,194
It came to me when I tried
to classify your species...

1176
01:33:38,439 --> 01:33:40,590
...and I realized...

1177
01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:43,034
...that you're not actually mammals.

1178
01:33:45,159 --> 01:33:47,515
Every mammal on this planet...

1179
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:52,550
...instinctively develops an equilibrium
with the surrounding environment.

1180
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:54,551
But you humans do not.

1181
01:33:55,079 --> 01:33:58,470
You move to an area
and you multiply...

1182
01:33:58,720 --> 01:34:03,032
...and multiply until every
natural resource is consumed.

1183
01:34:03,359 --> 01:34:05,350
The only way you can survive...

1184
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:08,472
...is to spread to another area.

1185
01:34:13,680 --> 01:34:16,432
There is another organism
on this planet...

1186
01:34:16,680 --> 01:34:18,556
...that follows the same pattern.

1187
01:34:19,159 --> 01:34:20,752
Do you know what it is?

1188
01:34:21,119 --> 01:34:22,872
A virus.

1189
01:34:24,159 --> 01:34:27,072
Human beings are a disease.

1190
01:34:27,439 --> 01:34:28,918
A cancer of this planet.

1191
01:34:29,159 --> 01:34:31,195
You are a plague.

1192
01:34:31,720 --> 01:34:32,675
And we...

1193
01:34:33,239 --> 01:34:34,559
...are the cure.

1194
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:36,872
Okay, so what do you need?

1195
01:34:37,479 --> 01:34:38,548
Besides a miracle.

1196
01:34:39,119 --> 01:34:40,269
Guns.

1197
01:34:41,279 --> 01:34:42,234
Lots of guns.

1198
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:56,993
No one has ever done
anything like this.

1199
01:34:58,159 --> 01:34:59,990
That's why it's going to work.

1200
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:05,796
Why isn't the serum working?

1201
01:35:06,359 --> 01:35:08,555
Perhaps we're asking
the wrong questions.

1202
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:11,753
Leave me with him.

1203
01:35:14,239 --> 01:35:15,309
Now.

1204
01:35:26,079 --> 01:35:27,592
Hold on, Morpheus.

1205
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:30,434
They're coming for you.
They're coming.

1206
01:35:32,720 --> 01:35:34,756
Can you hear me, Morpheus?

1207
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,560
I'm going to be honest...

1208
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:39,069
...with you.

1209
01:35:43,279 --> 01:35:44,632
I...

1210
01:35:45,680 --> 01:35:46,555
...hate...

1211
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:48,676
...this place...

1212
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,194
...this zoo...

1213
01:35:51,439 --> 01:35:52,509
...this prison...

1214
01:35:52,760 --> 01:35:55,796
...this reality,
whatever you want to call it.

1215
01:35:56,039 --> 01:35:58,234
I can't stand it any longer.

1216
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:00,756
It's the smell.

1217
01:36:02,079 --> 01:36:03,877
If there is such a thing.

1218
01:36:04,199 --> 01:36:07,350
I feel saturated by it.

1219
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:10,028
I can...

1220
01:36:10,279 --> 01:36:11,109
...taste...

1221
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:13,876
...your stink.

1222
01:36:14,119 --> 01:36:17,715
And every time I do, I fear that
I have somehow been infected by it.

1223
01:36:17,960 --> 01:36:18,756
It's repulsive.

1224
01:36:19,680 --> 01:36:20,998
Isn't it?

1225
01:36:23,079 --> 01:36:25,274
I must get out of here.

1226
01:36:25,680 --> 01:36:27,796
I must get free.

1227
01:36:28,039 --> 01:36:30,792
And in this mind is the key.

1228
01:36:31,039 --> 01:36:32,631
My key.

1229
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:35,632
Once Zion is destroyed,
there is no need for me to be here.

1230
01:36:35,880 --> 01:36:37,438
Do you understand?

1231
01:36:37,720 --> 01:36:39,038
I need the codes.

1232
01:36:39,279 --> 01:36:41,510
I have to get inside Zion...

1233
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:44,229
...and you have to tell me how.

1234
01:36:44,640 --> 01:36:46,436
You're going to tell me...

1235
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:48,750
...or you're going to die.

1236
01:37:08,119 --> 01:37:09,796
Please remove any metallic items
you're carrying. Keys, loose change.

1237
01:37:09,796 --> 01:37:11,115
Please remove any metallic items
you're carrying. Keys, loose change.

1238
01:37:14,876 --> 01:37:15,864
Holy shit!

1239
01:37:27,472 --> 01:37:28,302
Backup.

1240
01:37:28,552 --> 01:37:30,065
Send backup.

1241
01:37:53,113 --> 01:37:53,988
Freeze!

1242
01:40:03,512 --> 01:40:04,467
What were you doing?

1243
01:40:06,233 --> 01:40:07,461
He doesn't know.

1244
01:40:07,712 --> 01:40:09,145
Know what?

1245
01:40:36,073 --> 01:40:38,462
I think they're trying to save him.

1246
01:40:52,712 --> 01:40:54,385
There is no spoon.

1247
01:41:22,792 --> 01:41:24,863
Find them and destroy them!

1248
01:41:26,432 --> 01:41:27,342
We're under attack!

1249
01:42:00,828 --> 01:42:01,623
Help!

1250
01:42:22,747 --> 01:42:23,896
Only human.

1251
01:42:24,948 --> 01:42:25,858
Dodge this.

1252
01:42:38,547 --> 01:42:40,027
- How did you do that?
- Do what?

1253
01:42:40,387 --> 01:42:44,141
You moved like they do.
I've never seen anyone move that fast.

1254
01:42:45,228 --> 01:42:46,546
It wasn't fast enough.

1255
01:42:49,188 --> 01:42:50,416
Can you fly that thing?

1256
01:42:51,707 --> 01:42:52,503
Not yet.

1257
01:42:55,828 --> 01:42:56,623
Operator.

1258
01:42:56,828 --> 01:42:59,864
<i>I need a pilot program
for a B-212 helicopter.</i>

1259
01:43:00,307 --> 01:43:01,536
<i>Hurry.</i>

1260
01:43:09,148 --> 01:43:10,706
Let's go.

1261
01:43:25,188 --> 01:43:26,222
No.

1262
01:44:15,707 --> 01:44:17,186
Morpheus, get up.

1263
01:44:17,427 --> 01:44:18,224
Get up, get up.

1264
01:44:54,707 --> 01:44:55,697
He's not going to make it.

1265
01:45:05,108 --> 01:45:06,096
Got you.

1266
01:46:50,542 --> 01:46:51,895
I knew it.

1267
01:46:52,702 --> 01:46:53,657
He's the One.

1268
01:47:08,981 --> 01:47:11,097
Do you believe it now, Trinity?

1269
01:47:16,782 --> 01:47:17,612
The Oracle.

1270
01:47:18,822 --> 01:47:21,096
- She told me...
- She told you...

1271
01:47:21,462 --> 01:47:22,975
...what you needed to hear.

1272
01:47:23,261 --> 01:47:24,536
That's all.

1273
01:47:25,542 --> 01:47:28,375
Sooner or later you'll realize,
just as I did...

1274
01:47:28,702 --> 01:47:30,896
...there's a difference
between knowing the path...

1275
01:47:31,622 --> 01:47:32,850
...and walking the path.

1276
01:47:35,782 --> 01:47:36,930
Operator.

1277
01:47:37,822 --> 01:47:40,256
<i>- It's good to hear your voice.
- We need an exit.</i>

1278
01:47:40,502 --> 01:47:43,175
Got one ready. Subway station,
State and Balboa.

1279
01:47:55,702 --> 01:47:56,612
Damn it!

1280
01:47:56,862 --> 01:47:58,011
The trace was completed.

1281
01:47:58,261 --> 01:47:59,137
We have their position.

1282
01:47:59,542 --> 01:48:01,692
Sentinels are standing by.

1283
01:48:03,341 --> 01:48:04,774
Order the strike.

1284
01:48:11,061 --> 01:48:12,131
They're not out yet.

1285
01:48:23,702 --> 01:48:24,975
You first, Morpheus.

1286
01:48:44,822 --> 01:48:47,016
Neo, I want to tell you something...

1287
01:48:50,141 --> 01:48:53,930
...but I'm afraid of
what it could mean if I do.

1288
01:48:57,381 --> 01:49:00,533
Everything the Oracle
told me has come true.

1289
01:49:03,181 --> 01:49:04,661
Everything but this.

1290
01:49:06,301 --> 01:49:07,097
But what?

1291
01:49:32,341 --> 01:49:33,899
- What happened?
- An agent.

1292
01:49:34,141 --> 01:49:34,938
Send me back.

1293
01:49:35,181 --> 01:49:36,011
I can't.

1294
01:49:37,942 --> 01:49:39,853
Mr. Anderson.

1295
01:49:41,942 --> 01:49:43,261
Run, Neo. Run.

1296
01:49:48,341 --> 01:49:49,899
What is he doing?

1297
01:49:50,141 --> 01:49:51,336
He's beginning to believe.

1298
01:50:17,219 --> 01:50:17,936
You're empty.

1299
01:50:17,936 --> 01:50:18,528
You're empty.

1300
01:50:19,096 --> 01:50:20,324
So are you.

1301
01:50:52,136 --> 01:50:55,015
I'm going to enjoy watching you die...

1302
01:50:56,096 --> 01:50:57,086
...Mr. Anderson.

1303
01:51:34,777 --> 01:51:36,768
Jesus, he's killing him.

1304
01:52:58,117 --> 01:53:00,153
You hear that, Mr. Anderson?

1305
01:53:00,877 --> 01:53:03,755
That is the sound of inevitability.

1306
01:53:06,237 --> 01:53:09,434
It is the sound of your death.

1307
01:53:10,317 --> 01:53:12,546
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.

1308
01:53:12,796 --> 01:53:14,354
My name...

1309
01:53:17,237 --> 01:53:19,193
...is Neo.

1310
01:53:50,117 --> 01:53:52,153
- What happened?
- I don't know. I lost him.

1311
01:53:54,636 --> 01:53:55,626
Oh, shit.

1312
01:54:07,516 --> 01:54:08,916
Sentinels.

1313
01:54:09,636 --> 01:54:11,787
- How long?
- Five, maybe six minutes.

1314
01:54:13,756 --> 01:54:15,827
Tank, charge the EMP.

1315
01:54:16,077 --> 01:54:18,988
- We can't use that until he's out.
- I know. Don't worry.

1316
01:54:20,317 --> 01:54:21,146
He's gonna make it.

1317
01:54:21,396 --> 01:54:23,194
Flat or pumps? No, just...

1318
01:54:23,436 --> 01:54:26,189
What the shit? That's my phone!

1319
01:54:26,596 --> 01:54:28,109
That guy took my phone!

1320
01:54:30,396 --> 01:54:31,193
Got him!

1321
01:54:31,436 --> 01:54:32,586
He's on the run.

1322
01:54:32,837 --> 01:54:33,632
<i>Mr. Wizard...</i>

1323
01:54:34,077 --> 01:54:35,395
...get me out of here!

1324
01:54:35,636 --> 01:54:37,434
<i>I got an old exit.
Wabash and Lake.</i>

1325
01:54:41,317 --> 01:54:42,113
Oh, shit!

1326
01:55:02,877 --> 01:55:04,787
Help! Need a little help!

1327
01:55:06,356 --> 01:55:07,506
<i>The door.</i>

1328
01:55:22,837 --> 01:55:24,270
<i>The door on your left.</i>

1329
01:55:25,157 --> 01:55:26,350
<i>Your other left!</i>

1330
01:55:32,796 --> 01:55:33,990
<i>The back door.</i>

1331
01:55:53,917 --> 01:55:54,985
Oh, no.

1332
01:55:56,596 --> 01:55:58,029
Here they come.

1333
01:56:25,636 --> 01:56:26,831
He's going to make it.

1334
01:56:36,636 --> 01:56:39,628
<i>The fire escape at the end
of the alley, room 303.</i>

1335
01:57:13,516 --> 01:57:14,346
They're inside.

1336
01:57:16,796 --> 01:57:17,592
Hurry, Neo.

1337
01:58:11,636 --> 01:58:12,591
It can't be.

1338
01:58:20,077 --> 01:58:21,395
Check him.

1339
01:58:25,237 --> 01:58:26,716
He's gone.

1340
01:58:33,157 --> 01:58:35,466
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.

1341
01:58:45,157 --> 01:58:47,033
I'm not afraid anymore.

1342
01:58:48,697 --> 01:58:52,190
The Oracle told me...
I'd fall in love, and that the man

1343
01:58:53,476 --> 01:58:56,832
 The man I loved would be the One.

1344
01:58:58,237 --> 01:59:00,113
So you see...

1345
01:59:00,796 --> 01:59:02,707
...you can't be dead.

1346
01:59:04,237 --> 01:59:05,988
You can't be...

1347
01:59:07,476 --> 01:59:09,546
...because I love you.

1348
01:59:11,317 --> 01:59:12,954
You hear me?

1349
01:59:14,037 --> 01:59:15,628
I love you.

1350
01:59:38,596 --> 01:59:39,631
Now, get up.

1351
01:59:48,277 --> 01:59:49,073
No.

1352
02:00:14,917 --> 02:00:15,712
How?

1353
02:00:16,556 --> 02:00:17,546
He is the One.

1354
02:02:36,117 --> 02:02:37,755
<i>I know you're out there.</i>

1355
02:02:37,997 --> 02:02:39,748
<i>I can feel you now.</i>

1356
02:02:40,157 --> 02:02:41,875
<i>I know that you're afraid.</i>

1357
02:02:42,117 --> 02:02:43,630
<i>You're afraid of us.</i>

1358
02:02:43,957 --> 02:02:45,708
<i>You're afraid of change.</i>

1359
02:02:45,957 --> 02:02:48,311
<i>I don 't know the future.</i>

1360
02:02:48,556 --> 02:02:51,024
<i>I didn 't come here to tell you
how this is going to end.</i>

1361
02:02:51,277 --> 02:02:54,109
<i>I came here to tell you
how it's going to begin.</i>

1362
02:02:55,037 --> 02:02:56,550
<i>I'll hang up this phone.</i>

1363
02:02:56,796 --> 02:02:59,755
<i>And then I'll show these people
what you don 't want them to see.</i>

1364
02:02:59,997 --> 02:03:01,793
<i>I'm going to show them a world...</i>

1365
02:03:02,037 --> 02:03:03,708
<i>... without you.</i>

1366
02:03:03,997 --> 02:03:07,466
<i>A world without rules and controls,
without borders or boundaries.</i>

1367
02:03:07,716 --> 02:03:11,265
<i>A world where anything is possible.</i>

1368
02:03:13,796 --> 02:03:15,070
<i>Where we go from there...</i>

1369
02:03:15,317 --> 02:03:17,194
<i>... is a choice I leave to you.</i>

1370
02:10:31,037 --> 02:10:32,025
