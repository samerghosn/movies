1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,022
This is the BBC. The following
programme is based on actual events.

2
00:00:05,403 --> 00:00:07,225
It's important to remember,
however,

3
00:00:07,272 --> 00:00:10,573
that you can't rewrite history.
Not one line.

4
00:00:11,019 --> 00:00:16,446
Except, perhaps, when you embark
on an Adventure In Space And Time...

5
00:00:49,564 --> 00:00:53,564
Sub re-timed by;
Dandysubs and cryinoutloud

6
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,212
Everything all right, sir?

7
00:01:31,253 --> 00:01:32,415
Are you okay?

8
00:01:34,192 --> 00:01:36,319
You need to move along now, sir.

9
00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:38,623
Sir...

10
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,287
You're in the way.

11
00:01:46,063 --> 00:01:49,840
<i>Hello?
Er, Mr Hartnell?</i>

12
00:01:51,143 --> 00:01:53,859
<i>Mr Hartnell, sir, they're
asking for you now.</i>

13
00:01:57,174 --> 00:01:58,973
<i>Shall I tell them
you're coming now?</i>

14
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:01,926
- Tell them what you like.
- Beg your pardon, Mr Hartnell?

15
00:02:02,106 --> 00:02:03,876
Tell them
what you bloody well like!

16
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:10,042
- Listen, I'm only doing my job.
- Sod off, will you! I'm not ready!

17
00:02:15,653 --> 00:02:17,699
I need more time.

18
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,264
Len! Len, for God's sake!

19
00:02:38,289 --> 00:02:40,361
You'll go up like a Roman Candle,
if you're not careful.

20
00:02:40,388 --> 00:02:42,754
- Can I take my head off, mate?
I'm boiling in here. - No!

21
00:02:43,165 --> 00:02:44,477
We'll be starting up
again in a minute.

22
00:02:44,584 --> 00:02:46,367
Why? What's the hold up?

23
00:02:46,448 --> 00:02:47,533
You know who.

24
00:02:52,566 --> 00:02:54,557
Well, tell him
to get his skates on!

25
00:02:54,567 --> 00:02:56,272
Some of us have got a
bloody planet to invade.

26
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:58,490
- Shh!
- What?

27
00:03:46,308 --> 00:03:47,912
Can I see your pass, sir?

28
00:03:47,937 --> 00:03:50,296
Ah, come on, Harry.
You know my face!

29
00:03:50,323 --> 00:03:53,414
- That's as maybe, sir.
- Sydney Newman. Clue's in the name.

30
00:03:53,757 --> 00:03:57,465
- Better than any mug-shot.
- Still need to see your pass, sir.

31
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:58,618
Ah, to hell with it!

32
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:03,775
That's not the way
we do things at the BBC, sir!

33
00:04:04,072 --> 00:04:05,627
You don't say!

34
00:04:27,077 --> 00:04:28,862
So, we got a great,

35
00:04:28,887 --> 00:04:31,641
big thumping audience for
Grandstand, but we lose them

36
00:04:31,667 --> 00:04:34,994
before the teeny boppers
tune in for Juke Box Jury, right?

37
00:04:35,019 --> 00:04:37,187
- Right. Erm...correct.
- We got a gap to plug.

38
00:04:37,213 --> 00:04:40,579
- 25 minutes.
- How about another Dickens?

39
00:04:40,605 --> 00:04:43,615
Fossilised, Mervyn! Fusty. Frowsty.

40
00:04:43,641 --> 00:04:46,310
And lots of less polite words
beginning with F.

41
00:04:46,336 --> 00:04:50,129
Here's a word for you, though - fun!
FUN! You heard of fun, Mervyn?

42
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:52,202
It that something else
you've brought from ITV?

43
00:04:52,228 --> 00:04:54,363
I hope so, I certainly hope so!

44
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:58,699
We need stuff to keep the sports
fans hooked and the kids too.

45
00:04:58,737 --> 00:05:00,076
Competitive Tiddlywinks?

46
00:05:00,101 --> 00:05:03,391
You know what I'm talking about.
science fiction?

47
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:06,805
Is it really that popular?
It was last time I took a look.

48
00:05:07,119 --> 00:05:11,384
With juvenile boys, perhaps.
I like it.

49
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:15,845
♪ Oh, let's have a wonderful time
Let's have a wonderful time

50
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:19,161
♪ Come on, everybody
and let's have a wonderful time... ♪

51
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:21,990
She thought the balloon had gone up.

52
00:05:22,177 --> 00:05:24,632
- What?
- She thought we'd all had it.

53
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:29,084
Cuba! No point in holding back
if the missiles started flying.

54
00:05:29,497 --> 00:05:32,129
So she put it about a bit.
A lot!

55
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:40,533
So what did they say? "You're only
a production assistant, dear.

56
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,906
"It's a bit of a leap."
I'm giving myself a year, Jackie.

57
00:05:43,932 --> 00:05:48,694
Get on in television or get out.
Oh. What do I know?

58
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,505
I spend my time trying not to
bump into the cameras,

59
00:05:51,531 --> 00:05:54,699
but don't pack in yet, Verity.
Softly, softly, eh?

60
00:05:54,725 --> 00:05:58,139
- Mmm. You've got a... What?
- Red wine.

61
00:05:58,165 --> 00:05:59,485
Oh. Red wine.

62
00:06:01,793 --> 00:06:03,985
- Oh, Lord, it's on, isn't it?
- What?

63
00:06:04,011 --> 00:06:06,983
The space shot! The Soviets.
Valentina what's-it.

64
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:11,276
- First woman in space!
- Oh, God, yes!

65
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:20,543
And there she is,
Valentina Tereshkova looking,

66
00:06:20,569 --> 00:06:23,783
appropriately enough,
on top of the world.

67
00:06:30,434 --> 00:06:32,562
Pop, pop, pop.

68
00:06:34,218 --> 00:06:35,877
The first woman in space,

69
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:39,033
a major triumph there
for the Soviet Union

70
00:06:39,045 --> 00:06:41,411
in the ever-escalating space race.

71
00:06:45,396 --> 00:06:47,305
- Hello?
- Verity, it's Sydney.

72
00:06:47,331 --> 00:06:48,968
- What?
- Sydney!

73
00:06:48,995 --> 00:06:51,860
Sydney!
Hello, stranger.

74
00:06:52,355 --> 00:06:55,598
- You know anything about children, Verity?
- Not a thing.

75
00:06:55,610 --> 00:07:00,230
We want to do a science fiction
serial. Legitimate stuff, though.

76
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,024
- No tin robots or BEMs.
- BEMs?

77
00:07:04,035 --> 00:07:07,583
Bug-Eyed Monsters! You know...
mutations and Death Rays.

78
00:07:07,596 --> 00:07:10,213
Brains in glass jars,
that kind of crap.

79
00:07:10,223 --> 00:07:12,507
It's going to run all year.

80
00:07:12,518 --> 00:07:15,259
So a good-looking guy,
a good-looking girl

81
00:07:15,271 --> 00:07:17,684
and a kid who gets herself
into all kinds of trouble.

82
00:07:17,711 --> 00:07:21,163
Plus an older man. Quirky.
I'll come back to him.

83
00:07:21,173 --> 00:07:24,824
They travel about in space
and time getting into scrapes!

84
00:07:24,834 --> 00:07:28,192
- That's a lovely idea!
- You know me. Pop! Pop! Pop!

85
00:07:29,454 --> 00:07:31,947
And we want history too.
Proper history.

86
00:07:31,957 --> 00:07:35,242
The kids at home should learn
something.

87
00:07:35,252 --> 00:07:37,788
And what about this other man?
The quirky character?

88
00:07:37,798 --> 00:07:40,290
- He's a doctor.
- A doctor?
- Mm-hmm.

89
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,067
He should be a doctor,
don't you think?

90
00:07:42,093 --> 00:07:45,987
Makes him an authority figure,
Sorta, kinda reassuring.

91
00:07:50,244 --> 00:07:52,245
So, what do you think?

92
00:07:53,456 --> 00:07:57,074
Look, Sydney, I'd love to work with
you again. Really I would.

93
00:07:57,084 --> 00:07:59,702
It's just...

94
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:02,851
I gave myself a year.
Get on in TV or get out...

95
00:08:02,877 --> 00:08:04,916
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

96
00:08:04,927 --> 00:08:07,697
I don't want you to
be my assistant again, kid!

97
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:09,903
I want you to produce it!

98
00:08:12,795 --> 00:08:13,678
Produce it?

99
00:08:13,704 --> 00:08:17,653
Sure. They've never had a female
producer here! Sit down!

100
00:08:19,661 --> 00:08:21,528
You're just what this place needs!

101
00:08:21,538 --> 00:08:25,887
- Someone with piss and
vinegar in their veins!
- Thanks! I think.

102
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:30,459
- I did a show called
Pathfinders at ITV. You see it?
- Um...

103
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:34,664
We had an old guy as the hero.
A grumpy old guy.

104
00:08:34,674 --> 00:08:37,011
That's what we want here.

105
00:08:41,155 --> 00:08:45,674
Wait for it! Attention!

106
00:08:45,706 --> 00:08:48,990
Oh, my stars!
What did I do to deserve you lot?

107
00:08:49,001 --> 00:08:50,419
Drivel.

108
00:08:52,588 --> 00:08:58,293
- We'll make her a skirt...
- No-one rung?

109
00:08:58,302 --> 00:09:01,477
- Not since you last asked.
- All right.

110
00:09:01,529 --> 00:09:04,419
- Five minutes ago.
- All right, all right!

111
00:09:04,446 --> 00:09:05,942
You've only been out of work
a couple of weeks.

112
00:09:05,951 --> 00:09:08,193
Well, I'm not built
for lazing around, am I?

113
00:09:08,203 --> 00:09:10,529
I've got to graft
or I'll go round the twist.

114
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:13,158
What about that play?

115
00:09:13,168 --> 00:09:17,129
Another ruddy army part! No fear.
That's all they ever offer me.

116
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:19,476
Crooks and perishing
Sergeant Majors!

117
00:09:19,503 --> 00:09:23,536
But that's how casting people
see you, isn't it, love?
Authority figures.

118
00:09:25,245 --> 00:09:29,697
♪ - My grandfather's a funny 'un... ♪
- Don't do that.

119
00:09:29,707 --> 00:09:33,385
♪ He's got a face
like a pickled onion. ♪

120
00:09:33,412 --> 00:09:37,898
- Stop it! Bloody rubbish.
- Bill! Not in front of Judi.

121
00:09:37,923 --> 00:09:41,878
♪ - My Grandfather's a funny 'un. ♪
- I said stop it!

122
00:09:41,889 --> 00:09:44,879
Why are you always so grumpy, Sampa?

123
00:09:44,904 --> 00:09:48,770
What? What's it got to
do with you?  Silly girl!

124
00:09:50,139 --> 00:09:55,518
Judi? Judi-poodi, darling?
For goodness' sake, Bill!

125
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:58,268
- Go after her!
- I told the girl once.
What's wrong with her?

126
00:09:58,293 --> 00:10:02,974
- Cloth-ears?
- Urgh! Don't you like being successful?

127
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,870
That's not success! I'm legitimate!
A legitimate character actor

128
00:10:06,895 --> 00:10:10,010
of the stage and film!
This is variety!

129
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,686
I only asked.

130
00:11:01,234 --> 00:11:03,809
What about Leslie French?
He'd be marvelous.

131
00:11:03,821 --> 00:11:07,384
He's working with Visconti.
Gave us a polite no.

132
00:11:08,205 --> 00:11:11,166
- Cyril Cusack?
- A less polite no.

133
00:11:11,192 --> 00:11:14,134
- Ahem.
- Can I help you?

134
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:15,750
I think you're in my office.

135
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:17,683
That's a rather interesting
way of looking at it.

136
00:11:18,634 --> 00:11:23,044
- I'm rather an interesting person.
- I don't doubt it. Rex Tucker.

137
00:11:23,071 --> 00:11:25,149
I'm looking after Doctor Who.

138
00:11:25,176 --> 00:11:29,682
Pending the appointment
of the permanent producer.

139
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:32,716
- Oh. Is he with you?
- You're looking at him.

140
00:11:33,895 --> 00:11:38,013
- I keep coming back to Hugh David.
- Who?

141
00:11:38,038 --> 00:11:41,317
He was in Knight Errant on ITV.
Lovely actor.

142
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,745
Not old enough for the Doctor,
surely?

143
00:11:44,772 --> 00:11:46,797
Well, we don't want Grandpa Moses,
do we?

144
00:11:47,018 --> 00:11:49,052
We need someone who can play older.

145
00:11:49,104 --> 00:11:50,780
The shooting schedule's going to
be pretty punishing.

146
00:11:51,341 --> 00:11:53,596
- I've got some ideas.
- I'll call Hugh. See what he thinks.

147
00:11:53,623 --> 00:11:56,508
I'd rather you didn't.
Is that a fact? Waste of time!

148
00:11:58,628 --> 00:12:00,986
We need someone like Frank
Morgan in the Wizard Of Oz.

149
00:12:01,013 --> 00:12:01,881
He's dead.

150
00:12:02,051 --> 00:12:04,725
- Rex... And American.
- I said "like".

151
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:09,951
Well, perhaps
we should all sleep on it.

152
00:12:10,764 --> 00:12:13,966
After all, it took them
months to find Scarlet O'Hara!

153
00:12:20,202 --> 00:12:24,082
Um...dear lady, may I have a word?

154
00:12:37,306 --> 00:12:38,707
Hello?

155
00:12:39,056 --> 00:12:40,530
Yes.

156
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,639
Oh, yes?

157
00:12:50,878 --> 00:12:52,375
Is it right you were Sydney's

158
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,110
production assistant
on the other channel? Yes.

159
00:12:55,135 --> 00:12:56,738
So this is quite a promotion.

160
00:12:56,764 --> 00:13:00,210
Apparently.
Bound to ruffle a few feathers.

161
00:13:00,221 --> 00:13:03,100
If feathers don't ruffle,
nothing flies.

162
00:13:04,636 --> 00:13:07,486
This show is going to be a terrific
challenge, you know.

163
00:13:07,789 --> 00:13:10,091
Outer space. Time travel.

164
00:13:10,332 --> 00:13:12,726
In the first script,
they go back to the Stone Age.

165
00:13:12,806 --> 00:13:15,288
You'll need all
the help you can get.

166
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:19,892
So, Rex is going to act
as a sort of mentor to you.

167
00:13:19,931 --> 00:13:21,732
A ship can't have two captains.

168
00:13:22,404 --> 00:13:26,023
- Dear lady...
- Please don't call me that.
- Sorry.

169
00:13:26,568 --> 00:13:30,638
And what about you, Mervyn?
What's your function?

170
00:13:31,433 --> 00:13:34,552
I'm to be your sort of
technical boffin.

171
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:37,999
Help you through
the mire of all this.

172
00:13:39,634 --> 00:13:42,500
Sydney obviously thinks he's got
the right person for the job.

173
00:13:42,604 --> 00:13:44,336
That's what he wants for
Doctor Who.

174
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:46,513
Someone with piss
and vinegar in their veins.

175
00:13:46,567 --> 00:13:49,716
- Did he say that?
- He's very blunt.

176
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,548
Yes.

177
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:54,724
Look, all I'm saying is, dear la...

178
00:13:55,754 --> 00:14:01,788
Verity. All I'm saying is that
experience is not a dirty word.

179
00:14:02,635 --> 00:14:04,008
Don't fight us.

180
00:14:04,212 --> 00:14:07,874
Perhaps you could add a few drops
of warm beer in with your...

181
00:14:07,961 --> 00:14:12,187
- Piss and...
- Mixture. Just for the time being.

182
00:14:13,307 --> 00:14:17,128
Well. We'd better clear out,
we'll have the news team in here.

183
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:18,857
That's clever.

184
00:14:19,312 --> 00:14:21,866
So they don't have to look down
at their words all the time.

185
00:14:21,932 --> 00:14:25,038
Yes. Quite a wheeze.

186
00:14:25,154 --> 00:14:27,086
Someone'll make a fortune
out of that.

187
00:14:27,307 --> 00:14:32,488
- I suppose so. Shame I didn't
get to the patent office faster.
- Why?

188
00:14:32,986 --> 00:14:34,947
I invented it!

189
00:14:40,582 --> 00:14:42,614
Well, have a look at it, Bill.

190
00:14:42,956 --> 00:14:44,962
It certainly sounds different.

191
00:14:46,043 --> 00:14:48,818
And it's an old man part, you know.
Is it?

192
00:14:48,845 --> 00:14:51,251
Yeah! It's like This Sporting Life.

193
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,977
Well, I love playing older!

194
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,279
I know.

195
00:14:56,475 --> 00:14:59,216
Well? What next?

196
00:14:59,226 --> 00:15:04,201
He's going to set up a meeting. He
sounded ever so upbeat on the phone.

197
00:15:04,227 --> 00:15:06,022
He says it's a smashing role.

198
00:15:08,061 --> 00:15:09,116
For the BBC.

199
00:15:09,143 --> 00:15:11,326
Yeah, yeah...

200
00:15:12,388 --> 00:15:13,869
and it's for kiddies!

201
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,501
Come on, Stumpy!

202
00:15:33,337 --> 00:15:35,133
Off to Madame Bovary.

203
00:15:35,211 --> 00:15:37,565
Well, I'm sure he'll be
happier away from us.

204
00:15:39,094 --> 00:15:43,240
- Any news from the design department?
- They're not being very helpful, I'm afraid.

205
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,801
What is this?!
What're we going to do with this?

206
00:15:46,826 --> 00:15:49,695
Stone Age Man going, "Ug"!
It's crazy!

207
00:15:49,721 --> 00:15:53,018
Cavemen and doctors and
disappearing bloody police boxes!

208
00:15:53,043 --> 00:15:54,769
- What're we going to do?
- Waris Hussein. Our director.

209
00:15:55,128 --> 00:15:57,177
- Verity.
- Hi.

210
00:15:57,202 --> 00:15:58,736
What have you just been working on?

211
00:15:59,238 --> 00:16:00,225
Er, Compact.

212
00:16:00,456 --> 00:16:03,275
Oh. High art indeed.

213
00:16:05,445 --> 00:16:06,269
Shut up.

214
00:16:06,296 --> 00:16:08,230
Don't people say "Ug" in Compact?

215
00:16:08,293 --> 00:16:11,246
Frequently.
Mostly after a liquid lunch.

216
00:16:11,826 --> 00:16:13,946
The cavemen script is the only
one ready to go.

217
00:16:13,971 --> 00:16:15,010
We have to start with it.

218
00:16:15,037 --> 00:16:16,701
Right, and where are we shooting?

219
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:20,144
Lime Grove. Studio D.

220
00:16:20,171 --> 00:16:23,836
Oh, God, not there!
We can't do anything there.

221
00:16:23,863 --> 00:16:27,416
It's a broom cupboard.
It's smaller on the inside.

222
00:16:27,426 --> 00:16:30,722
It's the wrong shape and the
sprinklers go off when it gets hot.

223
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,048
Well, you'll make it brilliantly,
won't you?

224
00:16:34,591 --> 00:16:36,634
Oh. I see. Simple as that.

225
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:38,918
It'll never work.

226
00:16:44,258 --> 00:16:45,653
When do we start?

227
00:16:52,663 --> 00:16:54,250
Excuse me.

228
00:16:55,924 --> 00:16:57,217
Excuse me.

229
00:16:57,936 --> 00:16:59,152
Hello?

230
00:16:59,282 --> 00:17:00,634
Yes, sir? Gin and tonic...

231
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:03,373
Vodka and tonic
and a red wine, please.

232
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:03,985
Sorry, love, I'm serving...

233
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:06,788
Vodka and tonic
and a red wine, please.

234
00:17:07,643 --> 00:17:09,468
Vodka tonic, red wine.

235
00:17:09,478 --> 00:17:12,856
Thank you.
I'd have been stood here all night.

236
00:17:15,047 --> 00:17:17,800
"We are all strangers
in a strange land."

237
00:17:18,575 --> 00:17:19,816
Very profound.

238
00:17:19,842 --> 00:17:23,278
Isn't it? You'll find
I'm generally pretty profound.

239
00:17:24,601 --> 00:17:27,012
- I wish I had your front.
- I wish I had your behind.

240
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:29,306
- Shh! Like a little peach.
- Shut up!

241
00:17:33,068 --> 00:17:36,615
Don't be fooled, Waris.
That's all it is.

242
00:17:36,942 --> 00:17:39,195
Front.
Inside, I'm shaking like a leaf.

243
00:17:39,221 --> 00:17:41,944
I'm here by the skin
of my bloody teeth.

244
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:44,572
First Indian director
this place has ever had.

245
00:17:44,961 --> 00:17:47,363
So, we've got to stick together,
haven't we?

246
00:17:47,546 --> 00:17:49,940
Make our little show work.
That'll teach them.

247
00:17:49,991 --> 00:17:52,268
Who? The old guard.

248
00:17:53,133 --> 00:17:57,888
This - sea of fag smoke,
tweed and sweaty men.

249
00:17:59,563 --> 00:18:01,316
Not that I'm knocking sweaty men.

250
00:18:01,342 --> 00:18:02,593
I should hope not.

251
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:08,936
Listen, I overheard a couple of old
horrors standing by the tea urn.

252
00:18:08,948 --> 00:18:12,769
They said, "Well, she didn't get
here standing up, did she?"

253
00:18:12,795 --> 00:18:14,115
Sydney's bit of fluff, am I?

254
00:18:14,141 --> 00:18:15,819
Well, that seems to be
the impression.

255
00:18:15,897 --> 00:18:18,015
How else could you get
a promotion like this?

256
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,253
A promotion like what?

257
00:18:19,486 --> 00:18:21,663
I'm trying to recreate
the Stone Age with Airfix glue

258
00:18:21,689 --> 00:18:23,299
and bloody BacoFoil!

259
00:18:24,217 --> 00:18:25,128
We're trying to.

260
00:18:25,207 --> 00:18:26,586
Yes. Sorry.

261
00:18:28,202 --> 00:18:30,952
Here's to us. The posh wog!

262
00:18:30,979 --> 00:18:33,440
And the pushy Jewish bird!

263
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,294
- L'chaim!
- Cheers.

264
00:18:37,299 --> 00:18:39,778
- We could have our own series!
- We do!

265
00:18:41,307 --> 00:18:45,520
I don't want any of this muck,
thanks very much. I'll have a drink.

266
00:18:45,808 --> 00:18:46,554
Right.

267
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,957
You the director, son?

268
00:18:49,035 --> 00:18:50,095
Yes.

269
00:18:50,105 --> 00:18:52,180
Hardly out of the cradle,
the pair of you.

270
00:18:52,569 --> 00:18:55,173
Right. Let's talk turkey.

271
00:18:55,213 --> 00:18:58,257
- I'm not sure about this. Not sure at all.
- No?

272
00:18:58,296 --> 00:19:01,372
Apart from anything else, I don't
want to take on another long run.

273
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:03,699
Had enough of that on
The Army Game. Nearly killed me.

274
00:19:03,763 --> 00:19:05,654
Weekly bloody rep!
Would you like to order drinks?

275
00:19:05,681 --> 00:19:07,462
Whiskey and soda.
Chopee, chopee.

276
00:19:07,852 --> 00:19:11,881
Whose idea was all this?
That fella from ITV?

277
00:19:12,063 --> 00:19:13,627
Sydney Newman, yes.

278
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:17,407
But so many people have been
at the birth of the thing,
we'd be here all day...

279
00:19:21,022 --> 00:19:22,393
Tell me about the characters.

280
00:19:23,057 --> 00:19:24,542
Two school teachers.

281
00:19:24,608 --> 00:19:28,269
Ian and Barbara. They're intrigued
about one of their pupils.

282
00:19:28,295 --> 00:19:30,166
A young girl called Susan.

283
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:34,167
She seems to have impossible
knowledge for a girl from 1963.

284
00:19:34,325 --> 00:19:39,890
So the schoolteachers follow her
home. But "home" is a junkyard...

285
00:19:39,915 --> 00:19:42,309
Yes, yes, yes. Scripts.
I need to see scripts.

286
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:45,550
Oh, they're going wonderfully.
Wonderfully!

287
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:51,223
The BBC are really excited about
the show. They're throwing...

288
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:55,058
everything at it.
State of the art facilities.

289
00:19:55,085 --> 00:19:57,885
How do they get about?
Flying saucer or something?

290
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:02,324
Ours is a space and time machine
that can blend in with
its background.

291
00:20:02,349 --> 00:20:05,261
You mean it's covered in
invisible paint or something?

292
00:20:05,288 --> 00:20:07,535
No, no...
it adapts to suit its environment.

293
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,568
It gets stuck in one shape.

294
00:20:09,579 --> 00:20:11,112
A police box. A police box?

295
00:20:11,123 --> 00:20:15,366
How gorgeous would that be?
An ordinary 20th-century object

296
00:20:15,377 --> 00:20:18,123
on the surface of an alien planet!
Fantastic!

297
00:20:18,305 --> 00:20:21,991
- And the opening titles are like
nothing you've ever seen.
- Yes.

298
00:20:22,018 --> 00:20:24,185
You see, if you point
a camera down its own monitor,

299
00:20:24,211 --> 00:20:26,720
it creates the most wonderful
shapes, patterns...

300
00:20:26,746 --> 00:20:29,357
Like mirrors, endlessly reflecting.

301
00:20:29,384 --> 00:20:32,038
Swooping and pulsing,
like butterfly wings.

302
00:20:32,077 --> 00:20:34,069
Maybe I could be in them?

303
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:36,655
Just pop in front of the camera
would you, Tony?

304
00:20:36,682 --> 00:20:38,892
Let's see how that looks.

305
00:20:44,362 --> 00:20:47,550
Oh, Christ, no! That's terrifying!

306
00:20:47,761 --> 00:20:49,679
..and wait till you hear the music,

307
00:20:49,704 --> 00:20:51,732
we're using the latest technology.

308
00:20:52,782 --> 00:20:54,105
How did you do it?

309
00:20:54,355 --> 00:20:55,913
Brian's house keys.

310
00:20:58,031 --> 00:21:00,394
And what about the Doctor himself?

311
00:21:00,512 --> 00:21:03,047
He's something like 600 years old.

312
00:21:03,057 --> 00:21:05,400
Looks like a senile old man
but he's tough.

313
00:21:05,425 --> 00:21:07,979
Tough and wiry like an old turkey.

314
00:21:08,082 --> 00:21:11,327
It's what you do so well,
Mr Hartnell. Stern and scary...

315
00:21:13,095 --> 00:21:16,515
- but with a twinkle.
- Trust me, Bill.
You're perfect for it.

316
00:21:16,632 --> 00:21:18,098
No-one will be able to resist you.

317
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:18,981
You really think so?

318
00:21:19,008 --> 00:21:22,763
CS Lewis meets HG Wells
meets Father Christmas.

319
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:23,596
That's the Doctor.

320
00:21:23,935 --> 00:21:26,390
Doctor who, hmm?

321
00:21:27,387 --> 00:21:28,957
Come on, big smiles!

322
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:31,259
And again.

323
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:36,798
Come on, big smiles.
Cheers! Lovely.

324
00:21:36,825 --> 00:21:38,255
Come on, one more.

325
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,699
Lovely stuff. That's it!

326
00:21:40,724 --> 00:21:42,176
You're a brick for doing this.

327
00:21:42,202 --> 00:21:45,617
Contractually obliged, darling.
No, no! I mean the show.

328
00:21:45,644 --> 00:21:48,693
You'll all give it such gravitas.
Thank you.

329
00:21:51,123 --> 00:21:53,381
So, what do you make of him?

330
00:21:53,406 --> 00:21:56,128
Oh, I've always been a fan.
Wonderful screen actor.

331
00:21:56,204 --> 00:21:57,900
He frightens the life out of me.

332
00:21:57,925 --> 00:21:59,963
I think he's sweet. Bless him.

333
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:03,117
Bless him?
He's not as old as he looks.

334
00:22:03,606 --> 00:22:05,288
Must've had a tough life.

335
00:22:07,566 --> 00:22:08,853
Are you okay?

336
00:22:08,863 --> 00:22:10,950
Scared to death! Me too.

337
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:14,777
Oh, well. Goodbye, real world!

338
00:22:14,803 --> 00:22:15,828
One more.

339
00:22:21,829 --> 00:22:22,692
Patience.

340
00:22:22,778 --> 00:22:26,480
I have the patience of a saint.
But it's wearing very thin!

341
00:22:26,959 --> 00:22:29,252
We need the inside of the TARDIS
right now!

342
00:22:29,278 --> 00:22:30,280
I'm busy.

343
00:22:30,689 --> 00:22:33,268
You'll get your time machine
when I can find a moment...

344
00:22:33,336 --> 00:22:35,487
Too busy for a children's
programme, is that it?

345
00:22:35,512 --> 00:22:36,763
Patience.

346
00:22:41,172 --> 00:22:47,585
"If you could touch the alien sand
and listen to the sound..."

347
00:22:47,596 --> 00:22:48,299
Bugger!

348
00:22:49,713 --> 00:22:54,799
"If you could touch the alien sand
and hear the cry of strange birds

349
00:22:54,826 --> 00:22:58,403
"and watch them wheel in
another sky, would that satisfy you?

350
00:22:59,106 --> 00:23:03,027
"Susan and I are cut off
from our own people.

351
00:23:03,586 --> 00:23:08,680
"But one day we shall get back.
Yes. One day.

352
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:10,811
"One day."

353
00:23:10,903 --> 00:23:14,153
- Who's Susan?
- My granddaughter.

354
00:23:14,482 --> 00:23:16,268
I'm your granddaughter.

355
00:23:16,335 --> 00:23:19,154
Yes. Yes, of course you are, darling.

356
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:24,173
But she's my granddaughter in the
story I'm doing on the television.

357
00:23:24,479 --> 00:23:27,240
I play a funny old man
who lives inside a magic box.

358
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,419
Like a jack-in-the-box, Sampa?

359
00:23:29,743 --> 00:23:31,539
A little like that, yes.

360
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:37,488
But, this is a machine in disguise.
A time machine.

361
00:23:37,771 --> 00:23:40,487
Do you know how to fly
a time machine, Sampa?

362
00:23:40,542 --> 00:23:45,847
Hm? Yes! Yes, of course I do!
You'll see.

363
00:23:45,874 --> 00:23:47,884
You'll see
when I'm on the television.

364
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:52,250
We'll be going back through history
to meet kings and queens.

365
00:23:52,277 --> 00:23:54,676
And off to distant planets

366
00:23:54,702 --> 00:23:57,519
where the Doctor will have
all kinds of adventures.

367
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,000
The Doctor?

368
00:23:59,269 --> 00:24:01,634
He's the old man I'm playing.

369
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:05,236
A doctor?
Does he make people better?

370
00:24:10,494 --> 00:24:14,369
No! I have... Don't you think you're
being rather high-handed, young man?

371
00:24:14,846 --> 00:24:17,859
You thought you saw a young girl
enter the yard.

372
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:21,123
You imagine you heard music
or her voice?

373
00:24:21,213 --> 00:24:24,501
You believe she might be in there?
Not very substantial, is it?

374
00:24:24,528 --> 00:24:25,980
But why won't you help us?

375
00:24:26,762 --> 00:24:29,532
I'm not hindering you.
You intrude here....

376
00:24:29,558 --> 00:24:32,839
- He's tetchy as hell.
- ..start making accusations
and implications.

377
00:24:33,316 --> 00:24:35,028
If you both want to make
fools of yourselves,

378
00:24:35,054 --> 00:24:36,901
I suggest you do what
you said you'd do.

379
00:24:36,926 --> 00:24:42,462
Go and ask a policeman...
Bugger! Fetch a policeman.

380
00:24:42,598 --> 00:24:45,284
While you nip off quietly
in the other direction, I suppose.

381
00:24:45,309 --> 00:24:46,298
Come on, Barbara.

382
00:24:46,625 --> 00:24:48,759
What are you doing out there,
Grandfather?

383
00:24:48,785 --> 00:24:52,605
Go back inside! Shut the door!
Shut that door!

384
00:24:52,632 --> 00:24:53,847
Barbara!

385
00:24:53,874 --> 00:24:55,343
OK! OK, everyone.

386
00:24:56,073 --> 00:25:00,434
Fantastic. That's where we stop the
tape and go inside the spaceship.

387
00:25:00,461 --> 00:25:01,578
When it's built!

388
00:25:01,644 --> 00:25:02,959
OK. Good. Well done.

389
00:25:03,246 --> 00:25:04,051
Everyone happy?

390
00:25:04,194 --> 00:25:07,961
No, I'm not happy. Not at all.
Er, Miss Lambert.

391
00:25:07,987 --> 00:25:09,188
A word, if you please.

392
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:11,532
Coffee? Good idea. Thank you.

393
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:15,208
The set for the machine? TARDIS?

394
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,377
When is it arriving?

395
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:19,652
There's, er, there's been
a...delay.

396
00:25:20,871 --> 00:25:25,095
It won't do. It just won't do.
I don't know how I'm expected to cope

397
00:25:25,121 --> 00:25:27,109
with all the technical gibberish
I have to spout

398
00:25:27,135 --> 00:25:29,579
without a bloody set to work on.
I'm sorry, Bill.

399
00:25:29,605 --> 00:25:33,422
I need time to plot out
all the buttons, you see.

400
00:25:34,365 --> 00:25:38,107
- Buttons?
- On the controls!
All the switches and dials.

401
00:25:38,134 --> 00:25:40,542
I need to know what they all do.

402
00:25:40,656 --> 00:25:42,500
What if I press something
to open the doors

403
00:25:42,526 --> 00:25:44,681
and the next week
I use it to blow us all up!

404
00:25:44,707 --> 00:25:46,323
You must see that?

405
00:25:46,884 --> 00:25:49,569
The children will spot it, you see,
if we try and fudge it.

406
00:25:49,845 --> 00:25:53,124
And we must discuss my character.

407
00:25:53,337 --> 00:25:54,037
Absolutely.

408
00:25:54,063 --> 00:25:56,297
He's too abrasive.
Too nasty. Do you see?

409
00:25:56,323 --> 00:25:59,356
Where's that twinkle
you talked about?

410
00:25:59,383 --> 00:26:02,792
The thing that made me
so right for it?

411
00:26:03,045 --> 00:26:04,490
I... Oh, Sydney!

412
00:26:04,972 --> 00:26:06,951
Sydney Newman, Head Of Drama,

413
00:26:06,977 --> 00:26:09,538
let me introduce you to
Mr William Hartnell.

414
00:26:09,565 --> 00:26:13,243
Right! Our Doctor! Great choice.

415
00:26:14,108 --> 00:26:16,145
I'm a big fan. Big fan.

416
00:26:16,202 --> 00:26:19,742
Oh, thank you.
But I do need to discuss...

417
00:26:19,769 --> 00:26:23,753
What was that terrific war picture,
you were in? What was that?

418
00:26:23,829 --> 00:26:26,551
Well, I've done a few.
The Way Ahead?

419
00:26:26,612 --> 00:26:29,767
Yeah! Hell of a picture.
You were sensational!

420
00:26:29,792 --> 00:26:31,410
Oh! Do you really think so?

421
00:26:31,435 --> 00:26:34,438
Oh, yes. Absolutely extraordinary.

422
00:26:34,463 --> 00:26:38,173
I did get some very nice notices.
Yes.

423
00:26:40,314 --> 00:26:43,586
Was that before or after
Brighton Rock?

424
00:26:43,613 --> 00:26:44,501
Oh, before...

425
00:26:44,528 --> 00:26:49,451
Of course!
You were in Brighton Rock! Wow!

426
00:26:49,478 --> 00:26:50,773
What a performance!

427
00:26:50,784 --> 00:26:54,256
Oh. Well. Ha-ha. You're very kind.

428
00:26:54,464 --> 00:26:57,253
It should have led to much bigger
and better things, you know,

429
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:00,403
but, erm...I wasn't blessed.

430
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:03,277
Not blessed? What the hell
are you talking about?

431
00:27:03,303 --> 00:27:06,702
Of course you're blessed. You're
going to be Doctor Who, aren't you?

432
00:27:06,729 --> 00:27:12,240
- Well, yes...
- Perfect choice for my little show.
My idea anyway.

433
00:27:12,267 --> 00:27:15,593
That's what I do. Ideas!
One day I came into ITV.

434
00:27:15,616 --> 00:27:17,026
"I got an idea," I said.

435
00:27:17,036 --> 00:27:19,361
"The Avengers!"
"What's it about?" they said.

436
00:27:19,491 --> 00:27:22,843
"How the hell should I know,"
I said. "But what a title!"

437
00:27:22,868 --> 00:27:24,210
Pop! Pop! Pop!

438
00:27:26,932 --> 00:27:31,897
You, sir, are going to make
a huge impact with this character.

439
00:27:32,576 --> 00:27:33,292
I am?

440
00:27:34,855 --> 00:27:38,983
Only a movie star could do it.
So nuanced.

441
00:27:39,243 --> 00:27:40,434
So many layers.

442
00:27:40,875 --> 00:27:44,635
Well, you know. One tries.

443
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:47,673
And these kids are perfect for it.

444
00:27:48,037 --> 00:27:50,936
You couldn't be in safer hands.
Fun! Energy!

445
00:27:50,962 --> 00:27:52,740
Youth! Pop! Pop! Pop!

446
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:55,339
Freaks.

447
00:27:56,651 --> 00:27:58,142
Thank you so much, Sydney.

448
00:27:58,152 --> 00:27:59,834
You've no idea
what a difference it makes...

449
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:03,478
Be a producer, Verity.
Find a way to deal with this stuff.

450
00:28:04,008 --> 00:28:05,501
Or are you out of your depth?

451
00:28:26,421 --> 00:28:27,916
What are you doing?

452
00:28:30,954 --> 00:28:35,228
Being patient. What?
I can be very patient.

453
00:28:35,267 --> 00:28:38,811
- You can't stay here!
- Now, what shall we talk about?
I've got all day.

454
00:28:39,123 --> 00:28:40,528
Don't be ridiculous!

455
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:43,902
The Old Curiosity Shop!
The Roman Forum!

456
00:28:44,936 --> 00:28:47,253
The Hanging Gardens Of Babylon!

457
00:28:47,586 --> 00:28:49,779
Symphonies in pencil and ink.

458
00:28:50,096 --> 00:28:53,587
So, surely you can turn your hand
to my teeny little time machine?

459
00:28:56,555 --> 00:28:59,887
Just turn that blazing talent
of yours to my little kiddies' show

460
00:28:59,913 --> 00:29:01,446
and who knows what might happen?

461
00:29:01,472 --> 00:29:03,182
Won't take you more than
half an hour.

462
00:29:04,699 --> 00:29:06,924
You are a very trying woman.

463
00:29:07,006 --> 00:29:08,633
Then I'll get out of your hair.

464
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,854
Maybe the muse will be with you!

465
00:29:17,306 --> 00:29:21,916
Maybe it will be the best thing
you've ever thought of.

466
00:29:22,604 --> 00:29:25,314
Very well! Very well!

467
00:29:26,371 --> 00:29:28,363
Here. Here, madam.

468
00:29:28,777 --> 00:29:31,070
Here's your bloody TARDIS!

469
00:29:51,451 --> 00:29:53,233
Turned out rather well, hasn't it?

470
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:55,673
Through the cupboard doors
and into Narnia!

471
00:29:55,809 --> 00:29:58,467
It's too bloody big.
Takes up half the studio.

472
00:29:58,544 --> 00:30:00,160
Yes, yes?

473
00:30:00,185 --> 00:30:03,053
Yes, yes, Waris, I heard him.
Thank you.

474
00:30:03,102 --> 00:30:04,884
Right. Can you pass me my script,
please?

475
00:30:06,021 --> 00:30:08,138
This is ridiculous!
Sorry, boys and girls.

476
00:30:08,726 --> 00:30:10,903
He says he won't have
his teeth blacked out, Guv.

477
00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:14,924
Dougie, it's 100,000 BC!
Yeah, I know.

478
00:30:15,027 --> 00:30:16,500
It's the Tribe Of Gum.

479
00:30:16,545 --> 00:30:18,949
He says he got them whitened
to get onto the telly.

480
00:30:19,057 --> 00:30:21,747
Well, does it matter?
We only see his bloody shadow.

481
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,807
I'll do it! What?

482
00:30:23,869 --> 00:30:25,778
I don't mind blacking my teeth.

483
00:30:26,002 --> 00:30:28,674
I've already got sand fleas in my
Y-fronts. Can't get much worse.

484
00:30:28,739 --> 00:30:31,357
OK, stout man!
I think we're sorted then, Guv.

485
00:30:31,568 --> 00:30:33,184
Thank you, Duggie.

486
00:30:33,538 --> 00:30:35,042
Red light, bell...

487
00:30:35,068 --> 00:30:36,973
OK, into position, everyone,

488
00:30:37,304 --> 00:30:40,453
and roll to record in 15...

489
00:30:42,104 --> 00:30:45,769
God, it's hot in here.
Anyone else hot? Yeah.

490
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:47,989
Can we do something about the heat?

491
00:30:48,395 --> 00:30:51,054
I thought he'd be used to it. What?

492
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:53,734
Nothing. Watch it, Arthur.

493
00:30:54,798 --> 00:30:57,323
Five minutes, chum.
Then they turn the lights out.

494
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,772
Them's the rules.

495
00:30:58,929 --> 00:31:01,023
OK, everyone. Quiet, please.

496
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:02,242
Quiet!

497
00:31:03,541 --> 00:31:06,461
Five...four...three...

498
00:31:19,472 --> 00:31:22,010
OK, come in to camera one, on one.

499
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:24,538
OK, clear two.

500
00:31:28,108 --> 00:31:30,172
These people are known to you,
I believe.

501
00:31:30,949 --> 00:31:32,690
What are you doing here?

502
00:31:33,377 --> 00:31:34,701
They're two of my schoolteachers.

503
00:31:34,737 --> 00:31:37,403
Is that your excuse for this
unwarrantable...

504
00:31:37,742 --> 00:31:40,067
Unwarranted intrusion?

505
00:31:40,338 --> 00:31:42,419
You had no right to invite them here.

506
00:31:42,992 --> 00:31:44,618
I blame you for this, Susan.

507
00:31:44,977 --> 00:31:46,422
You will insist on...
OK, come in on, er...

508
00:31:46,448 --> 00:31:47,175
Come in on three.

509
00:31:47,201 --> 00:31:49,285
- I warned you.
- But, Grandfather, I...

510
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:52,221
- Is this really where you live, Susan?
- Yes!

511
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:54,849
On three. Coming on one.

512
00:31:54,888 --> 00:31:56,296
It was just a box!

513
00:31:56,322 --> 00:31:58,730
On one, on three.

514
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:00,258
Come in on two.

515
00:32:00,806 --> 00:32:02,550
You see, I knew this would happen.

516
00:32:03,536 --> 00:32:04,855
Move the camera.

517
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:06,642
Get hold of the cable!
Get the cable!

518
00:32:06,667 --> 00:32:09,359
Move the bloody camera!
Arthur, what the hell is he doing?

519
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:10,722
Why doesn't he have a go?

520
00:32:10,863 --> 00:32:13,605
Now here we are, I'd just like to...

521
00:32:14,241 --> 00:32:16,025
I know this is absurd, but...

522
00:32:17,922 --> 00:32:20,289
The doors!
What's happening to the doors?

523
00:32:20,316 --> 00:32:22,003
It moves. The TARDIS can go
anywhere.

524
00:32:22,029 --> 00:32:25,183
TARDIS? I don't know what
you mean, Susan.

525
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:27,367
I made up TARDIS from the initials.

526
00:32:27,484 --> 00:32:30,299
Time And Relative Dimensions
In Space.

527
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:32,971
I thought you'd both realise
when you came inside

528
00:32:32,997 --> 00:32:35,019
and saw the different
dimensions from outside.

529
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:38,589
What's... What's happening to
the bloody doors?

530
00:32:38,615 --> 00:32:42,683
A thing that looks like a police
box, stuck in a junk yard,

531
00:32:43,088 --> 00:32:45,839
can move anywhere in time and space?

532
00:32:46,763 --> 00:32:49,057
Oh, Susan, don't be ridiculous!

533
00:32:49,084 --> 00:32:50,950
Oh, Christ,
stiff as Scotchman's wallet!

534
00:32:50,976 --> 00:32:52,826
But you are one of us.
You look like us.

535
00:32:52,852 --> 00:32:54,157
You sound like us.

536
00:32:54,683 --> 00:32:57,172
I was born in the 49th century.

537
00:33:01,332 --> 00:33:02,118
Oh...

538
00:33:05,806 --> 00:33:08,880
Covers! Get the covers!

539
00:33:09,826 --> 00:33:11,172
Everybody out.

540
00:33:11,711 --> 00:33:13,040
Am I on yet?

541
00:33:13,672 --> 00:33:14,771
Anyone?

542
00:33:15,915 --> 00:33:17,483
I've done me teeth.

543
00:33:18,792 --> 00:33:21,606
Wish I knew what bloody
dimension I was in.

544
00:33:21,714 --> 00:33:22,558
Hello?

545
00:33:24,356 --> 00:33:25,255
Hello?

546
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,545
Anyone?

547
00:33:36,707 --> 00:33:40,159
No, my child, we both know
we cannot let our secret loose

548
00:33:40,169 --> 00:33:41,674
into the world
of the 20th century.

549
00:33:41,701 --> 00:33:43,353
But you can't keep them
prisoner here!

550
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,316
He can't keep us prisoners anywhere.

551
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,646
I cannot let you go, schoolteacher.

552
00:33:47,896 --> 00:33:50,799
Whether you believe what you have
been told is of no importance.

553
00:33:51,047 --> 00:33:53,798
You and your companion would be
footprints in a time

554
00:33:53,825 --> 00:33:55,336
we were not supposed to walk.

555
00:33:55,362 --> 00:33:57,815
If I have to use force to get
out of here, I will, you know.

556
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,171
Maybe we've stumbled on something
beyond our understanding.

557
00:34:01,196 --> 00:34:03,173
Oh, why did you come here, why?!

558
00:34:03,451 --> 00:34:05,067
Grandfather, no!

559
00:34:05,093 --> 00:34:06,291
No, you don't!

560
00:34:06,439 --> 00:34:08,556
Oh, stop it! Let him go!

561
00:34:08,724 --> 00:34:09,971
Let me go!

562
00:34:14,896 --> 00:34:16,213
Let's go to lunch.

563
00:34:32,693 --> 00:34:33,632
Not hungry?

564
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:35,420
Don't seem to have much of
an appetite.

565
00:34:36,048 --> 00:34:37,621
Not surprised.

566
00:34:40,186 --> 00:34:41,704
I should fire the pair of you.

567
00:34:42,398 --> 00:34:46,717
Right. Take out the reference to
the future time they've come from.

568
00:34:47,302 --> 00:34:51,132
The 49th Century? Too specific.
It's Doctor Who, remember.

569
00:34:51,306 --> 00:34:55,012
And the old guy's too nasty.
He should be cuter. Funnier.

570
00:34:55,038 --> 00:34:58,947
And the kid needs to be cheeky too.
Like a regular teenager.

571
00:34:59,356 --> 00:35:00,690
Did you like any of it?

572
00:35:00,717 --> 00:35:03,909
Not much. Hate the opening titles.
You're joking?

573
00:35:03,934 --> 00:35:06,498
Too weird. It's sensational!
Just because it's new.

574
00:35:06,525 --> 00:35:09,777
Hey! Hey! I like new.
I do new, remember?!

575
00:35:11,793 --> 00:35:13,929
It's too scary for the kids.

576
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:16,706
I-I thought we were trying
to scare them.

577
00:35:16,731 --> 00:35:20,030
Scare them, not traumatise them!
Change it.

578
00:35:20,289 --> 00:35:21,842
Over my dead body.

579
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,144
It can be arranged.

580
00:35:29,041 --> 00:35:32,416
It'll cost. And they'll crucify me
for it.

581
00:35:32,668 --> 00:35:33,474
What?

582
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:36,050
Do the whole thing again.

583
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:42,429
I'm not right for the part.

584
00:35:42,454 --> 00:35:45,106
Bill... Just not right for it.
It... It isn't me. Bill!

585
00:35:45,132 --> 00:35:49,586
Isn't me at all! Listen to me.
Sydney thought it was good.

586
00:35:49,778 --> 00:35:52,139
He's over the moon! I let you down.

587
00:35:54,568 --> 00:35:56,072
You let me down?

588
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,626
You were right. You were so right.

589
00:36:00,635 --> 00:36:02,815
Look, we've made the Doctor
too abrasive.

590
00:36:02,842 --> 00:36:04,672
We need much more of you in him.

591
00:36:04,893 --> 00:36:07,871
Much more charm and warmth
and twinkle.

592
00:36:08,121 --> 00:36:10,623
You knew it, I couldn't see it.

593
00:36:11,646 --> 00:36:13,034
You sure you've got the right man?

594
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:14,856
Of course I am.

595
00:36:19,237 --> 00:36:21,146
I'm-I'm frightened, you see,

596
00:36:21,155 --> 00:36:25,983
I've...never really done
anything like this before.

597
00:36:26,009 --> 00:36:32,067
The...pressure, the schedule
and all those ruddy words...

598
00:36:34,222 --> 00:36:35,784
I'm here for you, Bill.

599
00:36:38,173 --> 00:36:39,418
Promise?

600
00:36:41,168 --> 00:36:42,503
Every step.

601
00:36:51,346 --> 00:36:52,273
Right...

602
00:36:55,641 --> 00:36:59,925
- I've got to tell the others now.
- Time and tide wait for no man, eh?

603
00:37:00,041 --> 00:37:03,751
Time and space, Bill.
And they wait for no woman either.

604
00:37:13,349 --> 00:37:14,844
I'm not hindering you.

605
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:17,175
If you both want to make
fools of yourselves,

606
00:37:17,186 --> 00:37:19,240
I suggest you do what you
said you'd do.

607
00:37:19,266 --> 00:37:20,692
Go and find a policeman.

608
00:37:20,717 --> 00:37:23,295
Clear three, clear three.

609
00:37:23,768 --> 00:37:26,538
Move to shot two. Tighter on two.

610
00:37:26,563 --> 00:37:28,309
I shall be here when you get back.

611
00:37:28,623 --> 00:37:30,925
I want to see your faces
when you try and explain...

612
00:37:30,952 --> 00:37:32,289
Tighter on one.

613
00:37:32,452 --> 00:37:34,286
..Chesserman... Chesterton.

614
00:37:35,293 --> 00:37:36,592
He got the name wrong.

615
00:37:36,617 --> 00:37:38,998
Can we go back?
Can we go back?!

616
00:37:39,025 --> 00:37:40,969
We've already stopped recording
three times.

617
00:37:40,996 --> 00:37:42,793
Only one more edit allowed, son.

618
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:45,572
Thank you, Mervyn.
Four edits in the whole show!

619
00:37:46,353 --> 00:37:47,606
It's so bloody primitive!

620
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:50,751
Young man speak truth!
BBC equipment from Stone Age!

621
00:37:50,777 --> 00:37:53,550
We have no choice, do we?
Onwards, Waris. Onwards!

622
00:37:53,577 --> 00:37:54,943
OK, stand by one

623
00:37:55,255 --> 00:37:57,163
Oh, no, Grandfather! No!

624
00:37:57,188 --> 00:37:59,590
Let me through.
Get back to the ship, child!

625
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:08,336
It could be anywhere....
Dear, dear, dear, dear.

626
00:38:08,362 --> 00:38:10,103
It's of no help to us at all.

627
00:38:10,164 --> 00:38:14,559
I suggest before we go outside and
explore, let us clean ourselves up.

628
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:17,342
- Oh, yes.
- What does the radiation read, Susan?

629
00:38:19,041 --> 00:38:20,603
It's reading normal, Grandfather.

630
00:38:32,023 --> 00:38:33,532
OK. Good.

631
00:38:34,025 --> 00:38:36,422
I'll tell them we can make
the transmission date.

632
00:38:40,233 --> 00:38:41,985
How are the other scripts
coming along?

633
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:44,572
Your Canadian pal is doing us
one about Marco Polo.

634
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:46,632
Terrific! That's more like my brief.

635
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,648
Get the kids hooked on real history.

636
00:38:48,673 --> 00:38:51,750
We're also trying one of Tony
Hancock's writers - Terry Nation.

637
00:38:51,775 --> 00:38:52,628
You got a script?

638
00:38:52,655 --> 00:38:54,184
- Yes. It's good.
- What's it about?

639
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:57,733
- Robots.
- No, no, no. They're not robots.

640
00:38:57,759 --> 00:38:59,759
Rule one - no robots!

641
00:38:59,889 --> 00:39:03,476
- Rule two...
- No bug-eyed monsters! I know.
But I promise you they're not.

642
00:39:03,503 --> 00:39:04,965
It's a really interesting story.

643
00:39:04,992 --> 00:39:07,226
Set on a distant planet after
a nuclear war...

644
00:39:07,251 --> 00:39:10,409
Okay, okay. Whatever.
Send it straight up to me.

645
00:39:10,744 --> 00:39:11,932
Then we'll see.

646
00:39:20,204 --> 00:39:23,443
This time in a few of weeks,
episode one will have aired.

647
00:39:23,469 --> 00:39:24,081
Hm.

648
00:39:26,344 --> 00:39:30,001
Brave heart, darling.
I think we'll be a smash.

649
00:39:30,039 --> 00:39:32,461
Fingers crossed.
We could do with a bit of luck.

650
00:39:44,478 --> 00:39:46,771
"Hideous machine-like creatures...

651
00:39:48,945 --> 00:39:51,534
"A lens on a flexible shaft...

652
00:39:53,117 --> 00:39:57,166
"acts as an eye...?

653
00:39:57,661 --> 00:40:01,713
"You will move ahead of us
and follow my directions!

654
00:40:04,452 --> 00:40:07,679
"Ian breaks away
and dashes for it...

655
00:40:12,527 --> 00:40:13,849
"Exterminate!"

656
00:40:15,902 --> 00:40:17,086
"Exterminate!"

657
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:27,815
'It is with deep regret
that we announce

658
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:30,215
'that President Kennedy is dead.

'He was shot down as he was

'through the city of Dallas, Texas.

'The identity of the assassin

662
00:40:56,266 --> 00:40:58,003
It was very good, Bill.

663
00:41:00,186 --> 00:41:02,427
'And now we return to the news.

664
00:41:02,438 --> 00:41:06,179

667
00:41:14,804 --> 00:41:16,891
They'll all be watching the news.

668
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:49,548
She's way over budget.

669
00:41:49,983 --> 00:41:53,365
No, no - it's more than that.

670
00:41:53,505 --> 00:41:57,550
I'm afraid Miss Lambert
doesn't know what she's doing.

671
00:41:57,706 --> 00:42:02,094
First cavemen,
now these silly robots.

672
00:42:03,221 --> 00:42:04,224
What are you saying?

673
00:42:04,693 --> 00:42:07,139
That you're not to do any
more than these four episodes

674
00:42:07,164 --> 00:42:08,643
you've already got in production.

675
00:42:09,947 --> 00:42:11,121
Kill it, Sydney.

676
00:42:12,568 --> 00:42:14,135
Kill Doctor Who.

677
00:42:18,012 --> 00:42:20,322
In the village where I lived
down there...

678
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:23,940
- Reviews were respectable.
- Uh-huh.

679
00:42:24,476 --> 00:42:26,518
Ratings too. Respectable.

680
00:42:26,675 --> 00:42:29,057
- Considering what happened.
- Mm.

681
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:35,202
Sydney wants to see you, Verity.

682
00:42:55,672 --> 00:42:58,760
It's my fault.
I promoted you too soon.

683
00:42:58,989 --> 00:43:01,528
I don't much like the way
the show's going.

684
00:43:01,664 --> 00:43:03,827
First, goddamn cavemen...

685
00:43:03,907 --> 00:43:07,360
- No choice, the...
- And then these...Dayleks.
- Daleks.

686
00:43:07,385 --> 00:43:09,177
Exactly what I wanted to avoid.

687
00:43:09,204 --> 00:43:11,327
Cheapjack science fiction trash.

688
00:43:11,353 --> 00:43:12,594
- Have you read the script?
- Yes!

689
00:43:12,619 --> 00:43:15,329
- Really?
- Well, enough to know
garbage when I see it.

690
00:43:15,355 --> 00:43:17,481
- Jesus. Dorloks.
- Daleks!

691
00:43:17,507 --> 00:43:18,985
Whatever! Bug-eyed...

692
00:43:19,012 --> 00:43:20,505
They're not bug-eyed monsters!

693
00:43:21,507 --> 00:43:23,356
They used to be like us.

694
00:43:23,472 --> 00:43:25,277
Radiation has made them retreat

695
00:43:25,302 --> 00:43:27,206
inside these impregnable
metal shells,

696
00:43:27,233 --> 00:43:30,565
and now they hate
everything that isn't like them.

697
00:43:30,744 --> 00:43:32,793
All they know how to do is lash out.

698
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:33,967
The Doctor and his friends turn up

699
00:43:33,992 --> 00:43:35,483
and try to make them
see differently.

700
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:38,925
To understand other people
and make peace. It's good stuff!

701
00:43:39,563 --> 00:43:43,139
It's strong stuff, Sydney,
and I really, truly believe in it.

702
00:43:44,827 --> 00:43:48,862
Well, I wanted someone
with piss and vinegar.

703
00:43:51,284 --> 00:43:54,416
I think we've got something
really special here, Sydney.

704
00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:56,070
A knockout.

705
00:43:56,096 --> 00:43:58,318
We've just got to hold our nerve.

706
00:44:00,005 --> 00:44:00,949
Okay.

707
00:44:02,396 --> 00:44:03,315
Okay.

708
00:44:04,068 --> 00:44:05,746
I'll talk to the high-ups.

709
00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:16,478
- And I want a repeat.
- What?

710
00:44:16,713 --> 00:44:19,724
On Saturday. Repeat episode
one before episode two.

711
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:23,335
- No-one was watching
because of the assassination.
- Oh, I see!

712
00:44:23,838 --> 00:44:25,536
This is Kennedy's fault?

713
00:44:25,659 --> 00:44:27,847
We deserve a fair
crack of the whip, Sydney.

714
00:44:29,072 --> 00:44:33,226
You'd better be right
about these...Daleks.

715
00:44:34,351 --> 00:44:36,342
Let me be very clear, young lady.

716
00:44:36,871 --> 00:44:39,164
Your neck's on the block.

717
00:44:48,125 --> 00:44:51,769
Come on, get a move on.
It's like a rabbit hutch in here.

718
00:44:54,556 --> 00:44:56,851
OK, are you nice and snug?

719
00:45:03,208 --> 00:45:04,585
What the hell's that?

720
00:45:07,503 --> 00:45:09,110
Monster for the next story.

721
00:45:09,342 --> 00:45:14,065
- What's this, a sink plunger
and an egg whisk?
- Oh, well.

722
00:45:14,092 --> 00:45:15,117
If they can't take over
the universe,

723
00:45:15,143 --> 00:45:17,105
might be able whip up
a decent omelet.

724
00:45:26,391 --> 00:45:30,722
Roll to record in 15, 14...

725
00:45:30,748 --> 00:45:32,224
Quiet, please, everyone.

726
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:36,568
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

727
00:45:36,594 --> 00:45:40,143
six, five, four...

728
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:41,742
Action!

729
00:45:44,454 --> 00:45:49,211
You will move ahead of us
and follow my directions.

730
00:45:49,237 --> 00:45:52,034
- 'On two.'
- Immediately!

731
00:45:52,043 --> 00:45:53,619
'Tighter on one.'

732
00:45:53,833 --> 00:45:55,630
No, tighter!

733
00:45:57,211 --> 00:45:58,438
Stand by, one.

734
00:46:00,603 --> 00:46:02,302
'On one.

735
00:46:02,313 --> 00:46:03,563
'Near three.

736
00:46:05,793 --> 00:46:07,295
'Stand by, two.

737
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:11,608
- 'Two.'
- I said immediately!

738
00:46:11,907 --> 00:46:13,483
Fire!

739
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:17,378
- My legs!
- On two.

740
00:46:17,405 --> 00:46:20,481
- My legs!
- Your legs are paralysed.

741
00:46:20,945 --> 00:46:27,061
You will recover shortly unless you
force us to use our weapons again.

742
00:46:28,349 --> 00:46:34,293
Well, everyone, meet the Daleks.
Gosh, they're creepy, aren't they?

743
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:37,807
They're actually really creepy.

744
00:46:46,385 --> 00:46:49,210
Michael! Dennis!

745
00:46:49,416 --> 00:46:51,867
Your tea's getting cold.

746
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:55,385
And that thing you wanted
to watch, it's on!

747
00:47:00,590 --> 00:47:05,190
Why? Because we weren't aware of
it until it was too late, that's why.

748
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:08,101
<i>The truth is that your
supply of drugs has failed</i>

749
00:47:08,139 --> 00:47:11,559
and you came into the city to see
if you could find more.

750
00:47:11,789 --> 00:47:13,722
Thals? What are you talking about?

751
00:47:13,965 --> 00:47:16,074
We're not Thals, or
whatever you may call them.

752
00:47:16,101 --> 00:47:17,550
Can't you see we're very ill?

753
00:47:18,103 --> 00:47:23,782
- You and your companions
need a drug to stay alive.
- We have no gloves.

754
00:47:23,956 --> 00:47:24,771
Drugs.

755
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:27,362
You said "gloves". Eh?

756
00:47:28,936 --> 00:47:32,226
Yes, yes. I...I did.

757
00:47:32,373 --> 00:47:37,326
Because the Daleks are nasty and you
need special gloves to touch them.

758
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:40,666
Y-y-yes.

759
00:47:41,153 --> 00:47:44,943
Yes. You know things like that
because you're Doctor Who.

760
00:47:46,826 --> 00:47:48,266
That's...that's right.

761
00:47:57,036 --> 00:48:02,114
Exterminate! Exterminate!
Exterminate! Exterminate!

762
00:48:02,123 --> 00:48:06,235
Exterminate! Exterminate!
Exterminate! Exterminate!

763
00:48:06,262 --> 00:48:08,422
You will be my prisoner!

764
00:48:08,681 --> 00:48:12,329
You won't believe what I saw on the
bus this morning. It's...thrilling.

765
00:48:12,467 --> 00:48:14,126
Sydney wants you, Verity.

766
00:48:43,512 --> 00:48:46,264
Ten million viewers
for your bug-eyed monsters.

767
00:48:50,244 --> 00:48:51,420
Ten million.

768
00:48:54,282 --> 00:48:55,297
So...

769
00:48:56,313 --> 00:48:58,244
What do I know about anything?

770
00:49:01,128 --> 00:49:02,505
Well done, kid.

771
00:49:18,356 --> 00:49:22,019
A bus? What were you doing on a bus?

772
00:49:22,525 --> 00:49:24,592
Getting in touch with our audience.

773
00:49:25,391 --> 00:49:29,103
Our great, big, fat,
enormous bloody audience.

774
00:49:31,443 --> 00:49:33,518
Whoo-hoo!

775
00:49:41,987 --> 00:49:44,103
♪ Walking back to happiness

776
00:49:44,114 --> 00:49:46,523
♪ Woopah, oh, yeah-yeah

777
00:49:46,534 --> 00:49:48,733
♪ Said goodbye to loneliness... ♪

778
00:49:48,742 --> 00:49:52,251
Quickly, child! We're running
out of time! Check the fornicator!

779
00:49:52,277 --> 00:49:54,112
Fault locator.

780
00:49:54,974 --> 00:49:58,384
OK, I think we'd better
hold it there, please.

781
00:49:58,498 --> 00:50:00,458
First positions again.

782
00:50:04,824 --> 00:50:08,601
Verity. Verity! Look at this.

783
00:50:08,666 --> 00:50:10,322
Just look at this.

784
00:50:10,891 --> 00:50:12,340
General De Gaulle.

785
00:50:12,469 --> 00:50:14,068
"DeGaullek"!

786
00:50:14,157 --> 00:50:17,007
- That's wonderful!
- "No! No! No!"

787
00:50:19,052 --> 00:50:22,300
We've really got something here.
They love us.

788
00:50:26,878 --> 00:50:31,463
- Lovely stuff, this, you know.
- Shame it's not in colour.

789
00:50:31,619 --> 00:50:33,873
Come on, how much have I won?

790
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:35,251
Ah...

791
00:50:35,356 --> 00:50:39,885
35 elephants, 4,000 white stallions,
25 tigers...

792
00:50:39,911 --> 00:50:42,012
And ten bob, you old devil.

793
00:50:42,081 --> 00:50:45,077
Right, make-up are nearly done
with Kublai Khan's digits,

794
00:50:45,103 --> 00:50:47,547
- so we'd best press on.
- What do you think?

795
00:50:48,594 --> 00:50:50,409
- Wow.
- Very swish.

796
00:50:50,525 --> 00:50:54,163
- Do you like it?
- Gorgeous, Carol.
I wonder if they'll let me buy it.

797
00:50:54,195 --> 00:50:57,675
- It'll turn a few heads
on the Kings Road.
- Oh, God.

798
00:50:58,965 --> 00:51:01,916
- Something the matter, Bill?
- You should be more careful, sweetheart,

799
00:51:01,994 --> 00:51:03,664
throwing your money around like that.

800
00:51:04,476 --> 00:51:06,518
It's an insecure
profession, you know.

801
00:51:06,590 --> 00:51:10,059
- We should all bear that in mind.
- Fancy anything at Newmarket, Bill?

802
00:51:10,085 --> 00:51:12,001
You know what I mean.
I'm just saying.

803
00:51:12,842 --> 00:51:14,514
Splashing out
on new togs all the time,

804
00:51:14,539 --> 00:51:15,894
you don't know you're bloody born!

805
00:51:15,945 --> 00:51:19,146
I'm not a child.
I'll spend it how I like.

806
00:51:24,188 --> 00:51:25,726
You're right, of course, Bill.

807
00:51:26,179 --> 00:51:28,288
None of us knows how long
this is going to last.

808
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:30,679
No-one's irreplaceable.

809
00:51:50,038 --> 00:51:54,278
- Who told you that?
- Everyone mentions it.
So, you didn't go to RADA?

810
00:51:54,304 --> 00:51:58,764
- Roedean, darling.
- Eh?
- The girls' school.

811
00:51:58,809 --> 00:52:00,675
Must have been a typo on my CV.

812
00:52:00,701 --> 00:52:02,204
I've not got the heart
to tell Sydney.

813
00:52:02,231 --> 00:52:04,456
Bill, thank you so much
for the flowers.

814
00:52:06,074 --> 00:52:07,496
Sorry to see you go, son.

815
00:52:07,701 --> 00:52:12,217
- So, what's next for you?
- I've been offered A Passage To India.
- One-way?

816
00:52:12,684 --> 00:52:16,210
- Bill, I hope you never change.
- Bill, Bill, come on.

817
00:52:16,371 --> 00:52:19,692
- Quiet, please, everybody.
- Oh, yes.
- Bit of hush, ladies and gents.

818
00:52:21,856 --> 00:52:26,427
- Sure you won't stay?
Do some more with us?
- Pastures new.

819
00:52:27,117 --> 00:52:29,215
It's been a bloody blast, Verity.

820
00:52:29,291 --> 00:52:32,936
Couldn't have done it without you,
darling. Shoulder-to-shoulder.

821
00:52:43,114 --> 00:52:46,342
I saw you interfering with
some dials only last night,

822
00:52:46,369 --> 00:52:49,413
so I've decided to show you all
the things that you mustn't touch

823
00:52:49,438 --> 00:52:50,802
under any circumstances.

824
00:52:53,592 --> 00:52:58,255
Exterminate, exterminate!

825
00:52:58,282 --> 00:53:01,139
What the bloody hell?!

826
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:06,494
Hello, my darling.

827
00:53:08,621 --> 00:53:09,867
What do you think?

828
00:53:12,211 --> 00:53:14,036
"Thrills galore.

829
00:53:14,047 --> 00:53:20,940
"Full-size, real-life Dalek playsuit
from the BBC TV series Doctor Who."

830
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:25,347
Strike a light!
"Only 66 shillings and sixpence."

831
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:30,027
And we have these. Goodness!

832
00:53:30,378 --> 00:53:32,396
Man and boy, I've been at this lark.

833
00:53:32,422 --> 00:53:35,293
But I've never known
anything like it.

834
00:53:36,291 --> 00:53:37,376
Incredible.

835
00:53:40,983 --> 00:53:43,027
No-one's irreplaceable, eh?

836
00:53:44,695 --> 00:53:47,101
So much for softly-softly.

837
00:53:47,152 --> 00:53:49,286
At this rate, you'll
be running the place.

838
00:53:54,681 --> 00:53:58,268
- "Dear Uncle Who."
- Uncle Who!

839
00:54:00,226 --> 00:54:01,579
"I've got my...

840
00:54:02,353 --> 00:54:06,847
"physics O-level coming up
and I need your help."

841
00:54:06,856 --> 00:54:09,056
I don't know why they
think I can help them.

842
00:54:09,327 --> 00:54:11,288
It's all gobbledygook to me.

843
00:54:13,813 --> 00:54:14,981
Please.

844
00:54:15,878 --> 00:54:19,364
Doctor Who, can I please
have your autograph?

845
00:54:20,672 --> 00:54:22,219
Now, then, what's this?

846
00:54:22,565 --> 00:54:26,934
- An autograph?
- Teacher said it would be all right.

847
00:54:27,206 --> 00:54:31,472
- Well, that must make you a
very special little boy, um...
- Alan.

848
00:54:40,427 --> 00:54:41,838
Thank you.

849
00:54:43,478 --> 00:54:46,460
Please, Doctor?

850
00:54:47,364 --> 00:54:51,514
Yes, what is it, um...
What is it, Alan?

851
00:54:51,539 --> 00:54:55,780
- Please, when are them Daleks coming back?
- Daleks?

852
00:54:56,014 --> 00:55:00,543
- They're taking over the ruddy world.
- It's what they do best, isn't it?

853
00:55:01,282 --> 00:55:02,027
Oh!

854
00:55:03,126 --> 00:55:05,793
Wow!
Oh, wow!

855
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:08,597
Goodness me!

856
00:55:11,045 --> 00:55:16,717
Come along, come along. Keep up!
We must all get back to the TARDIS.

857
00:55:19,052 --> 00:55:20,306
What's this?
What's this?

858
00:55:20,331 --> 00:55:22,518
Look out! What?!
Look out! Run, run!

859
00:55:22,545 --> 00:55:26,472
Exterminate! Exterminate!

860
00:55:32,797 --> 00:55:34,465
Take three.

861
00:55:54,628 --> 00:55:55,565
Cut!

862
00:55:56,318 --> 00:56:00,472
Cut! Right, one more, please.
Quick as you can.

863
00:56:00,498 --> 00:56:03,349
Len,
you were nearly off the kerb.

864
00:56:03,376 --> 00:56:05,751
Why is it we always seem to have
to go again because of you?

865
00:56:05,777 --> 00:56:08,157
I need a wee, don't I?
You try being in here.

866
00:56:08,195 --> 00:56:11,681
Reset, let's go again!
It's not my fault!

867
00:56:12,012 --> 00:56:15,336
Bill. Bill, I thought
I might try something

868
00:56:15,362 --> 00:56:17,527
when I'm carrying you down the ramp.
What?

869
00:56:17,552 --> 00:56:20,164
I thought maybe
I just throw a look towards you,

870
00:56:20,268 --> 00:56:22,581
showing the Roboman's
inner turmoil.

871
00:56:22,771 --> 00:56:24,666
You know, I was a man once

872
00:56:24,692 --> 00:56:27,259
sort of thing, before the Daleks
made me like this.

873
00:56:28,023 --> 00:56:28,769
What do you think?

874
00:56:28,795 --> 00:56:31,829
- Don't be so bloody ridiculous.
- It was just a suggestion.

875
00:56:31,856 --> 00:56:32,885
Yes, well, stow it.

876
00:56:33,985 --> 00:56:36,152
- What's up with you?
- Mind your own business.

877
00:56:37,619 --> 00:56:39,036
Oi, Len! Over here!

878
00:56:41,961 --> 00:56:45,925
- It's not too late, you know.
- No, I've made up my mind.

879
00:56:46,009 --> 00:56:50,112
- They can rewrite this stuff in a shot.
- It's time to move on, Bill.

880
00:56:50,137 --> 00:56:53,166
- There's lots of other things I want to do.
- Well, of course.

881
00:56:53,193 --> 00:56:57,161
And there's more to life than
just screaming at nasty monsters.

882
00:56:57,186 --> 00:56:58,907
That's no way to talk about me.

883
00:57:08,556 --> 00:57:12,101
One day,
I shall come back.

884
00:57:13,393 --> 00:57:15,521
Yes, I shall come back.

885
00:57:17,981 --> 00:57:24,693
Until then, there must be
no regrets, no tears, no anxieties.

886
00:57:25,824 --> 00:57:30,112
Just go forward in all your
beliefs and prove to me

887
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:32,693
that I am not mistaken in mine.

888
00:57:36,416 --> 00:57:37,804
Goodbye, Susan.

889
00:57:40,103 --> 00:57:41,438
Goodbye, my dear.

890
00:57:55,324 --> 00:57:58,119
That's lovely, Bill. Really lovely.

891
00:58:03,385 --> 00:58:05,344
Doesn't like farewells, does he?

892
00:58:11,945 --> 00:58:15,030
Just stepping off
for a minute, Waris.

893
00:58:27,521 --> 00:58:30,588
Waris?
He's been doing that a lot lately.

894
00:58:41,891 --> 00:58:44,545
That's it.
Look over towards Bill, Maureen.

895
00:58:44,936 --> 00:58:47,717
That's it. Smile over here, please.
Big smile!

896
00:58:47,728 --> 00:58:50,012
Cheers!

897
00:58:50,023 --> 00:58:52,097
Cheers!

898
00:58:52,108 --> 00:58:56,068
One more. One more!
Just look at Bill.

899
00:59:03,996 --> 00:59:05,610
You look all-in.

900
00:59:06,262 --> 00:59:07,876
Mm.

901
00:59:08,543 --> 00:59:10,302
Come on, love. Why don't
you get your head down?

902
00:59:10,329 --> 00:59:12,166
We can go through this
in the morning.

903
00:59:12,193 --> 00:59:14,159
No, no. Got to get 'em in.

904
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:15,077
Got to.

905
00:59:20,692 --> 00:59:23,603
Maybe it's time you
thought about moving on, love.

906
00:59:24,188 --> 00:59:25,349
Moving on?

907
00:59:25,570 --> 00:59:27,677
You're shattered all the time.

908
00:59:27,704 --> 00:59:31,614
I can't! Even if I wanted to.
They're all relying on me.

909
00:59:31,639 --> 00:59:35,961
Hundreds of people, aren't they?
And all those kiddies out there.

910
00:59:36,302 --> 00:59:44,643
You can't have Doctor Who without
Doctor Who, can you? Come on.

911
00:59:48,530 --> 00:59:51,795
Vortis? What galaxy is that in?

912
00:59:55,822 --> 00:59:57,001
It's the Isop Galaxy.

913
00:59:57,027 --> 01:00:00,206
The Isop Galaxy, Chesterton.

914
01:00:00,958 --> 01:00:06,338
It's many... Many.
..many...light years... Away...away.

915
01:00:24,378 --> 01:00:29,581
'He is becoming delirious.
I do not understand his words.'

916
01:00:30,018 --> 01:00:35,231
'He is becoming delirious.
I do not understand his words.'

917
01:00:37,914 --> 01:00:43,159
Bill mustn't know I've spoken
to you. He'd play merry hell.

918
01:00:43,170 --> 01:00:44,920
What's the matter?

919
01:00:46,610 --> 01:00:48,445
Our GP rang.

920
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:52,173
Bill's not very well.

921
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:54,905
Oh, dear. Nothing serious?

922
01:00:55,576 --> 01:00:59,597
Not in the short-term. It's, um...

923
01:01:00,358 --> 01:01:04,528
er...arteriosclerosis.

924
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:08,706
It's a hardening of the arteries.

925
01:01:11,007 --> 01:01:12,414
I see.

926
01:01:18,757 --> 01:01:23,041
He smokes too much. Drinks too much.

927
01:01:23,724 --> 01:01:27,844
And these days, the only exercise
he gets is walking the dog.

928
01:01:28,521 --> 01:01:32,592
That, plus doing Doctor Who
virtually all year...

929
01:01:33,244 --> 01:01:35,018
Do you think he should stop?

930
01:01:35,173 --> 01:01:40,585
No. No, he couldn't bear that.
He loves the programme.

931
01:01:40,610 --> 01:01:43,442
He's so proud of it. And all of you.
You should hear him.

932
01:01:44,445 --> 01:01:46,021
But if there's anything you can do

933
01:01:46,047 --> 01:01:47,751
to lift the burden
from his shoulders,

934
01:01:47,777 --> 01:01:50,807
you know,
let him slow down a little.

935
01:01:53,597 --> 01:01:58,746
Well...I'll have a quiet word
with my successor.

936
01:02:01,077 --> 01:02:02,661
Oh.

937
01:02:05,023 --> 01:02:07,233
Oh. I see.

938
01:02:15,146 --> 01:02:18,259
Vortis? What galaxy is that in?

939
01:02:18,284 --> 01:02:22,039
The Isop Galaxy, Chesterfield.
Chesterton!

940
01:02:22,188 --> 01:02:26,989
Many, many light earths...
light years...

941
01:02:27,096 --> 01:02:28,239
from us.

942
01:02:29,905 --> 01:02:35,376
From...from Earth.
And yet the...Vortis...

943
01:02:35,402 --> 01:02:37,851
Vortis planet hasn't a moon.

944
01:02:40,831 --> 01:02:43,791
Hm? Eh?

945
01:02:46,206 --> 01:02:48,059
Right, hold it there, please!

946
01:02:48,141 --> 01:02:52,438
All this stuff,
I can do it with a look.

947
01:02:52,672 --> 01:02:55,402
Bill, I really think we should stick
with what's on the page.

948
01:02:55,429 --> 01:02:58,838
Verity. I can do all this
with a look, you know.

949
01:02:58,925 --> 01:03:00,461
I don't need all these lines.

950
01:03:00,496 --> 01:03:02,869
It's like ruddy King Lear!

951
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:05,755
I remember Lindsay Anderson saying
the same thing about me

952
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:06,838
on Sporting Life.

953
01:03:06,918 --> 01:03:09,538
He just ripped a couple of pages
out of the script.

954
01:03:09,690 --> 01:03:12,101
"Bill can do all this
with a gesture," you see.

955
01:03:12,514 --> 01:03:14,971
"A raised eyebrow."
Do you see what I mean?

956
01:03:18,019 --> 01:03:19,422
Of course.

957
01:03:21,940 --> 01:03:23,067
Bless you.

958
01:03:23,925 --> 01:03:26,927
Actually, I'm glad to have the
chance to talk to you, Bill...

959
01:03:26,954 --> 01:03:29,416
You're my rock, Verity. Oh...
You know that. My rock.

960
01:03:29,443 --> 01:03:30,797
I don't know about that...

961
01:03:31,038 --> 01:03:34,014
Since that day you first started
telling me about Doctor Who,

962
01:03:34,041 --> 01:03:35,547
I've been spellbound.

963
01:03:35,820 --> 01:03:40,309
Spellbound! But look at us now, eh?
Just look at us!

964
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:42,125
Our arses are in butter!

965
01:03:44,538 --> 01:03:46,369
What did you want to tell me?

966
01:03:48,242 --> 01:03:51,699
..Which, of course, was her way
of saying take a hike!

967
01:03:53,144 --> 01:03:55,713
So, I am justifiably
proud of myself.

968
01:03:55,739 --> 01:03:58,626
I can spot talent light years away.

969
01:03:58,887 --> 01:04:01,556
Ladies and gentlemen, Verity.

970
01:04:02,143 --> 01:04:04,929
Best goddamn appointment
I've ever made.

971
01:04:06,610 --> 01:04:08,186
Verity!

983
01:04:44,295 --> 01:04:46,206
Perhaps in a minute.

984
01:05:02,943 --> 01:05:05,092
Bill, I wanted to say thank you.

985
01:05:06,277 --> 01:05:07,844
For everything you've done.

986
01:05:09,487 --> 01:05:12,621
- I'm in demand and it's all down to you.
- Oh, nonsense.

987
01:05:12,684 --> 01:05:15,615
In no small measure, Bill.
Doctor Who has made me.

988
01:05:16,206 --> 01:05:17,476
But why does it have to change?

989
01:05:17,501 --> 01:05:21,090
Why do things always have to change?
Why can't we just go on as we are?

990
01:05:25,943 --> 01:05:27,320
Life.

991
01:05:32,085 --> 01:05:35,351
What about you?
Not ready for a rest?

992
01:05:35,378 --> 01:05:37,927
Me? No. Not a bit.

993
01:05:38,543 --> 01:05:41,190
This old body of mine
is good for a few years yet!

994
01:05:43,483 --> 01:05:45,780
I'm going to miss all this.

995
01:05:51,786 --> 01:05:53,400
You've got, erm...

996
01:05:54,483 --> 01:05:55,365
Oh.

997
01:05:56,077 --> 01:05:57,137
Let me.

998
01:06:07,094 --> 01:06:09,262
What am I going to do without you?

999
01:06:26,485 --> 01:06:27,956
Till we meet again.

1000
01:06:55,050 --> 01:06:57,190
That's it. Everybody ready?

1001
01:06:57,217 --> 01:07:01,210
Smile! Mr Purves... Jackie...
Look at each other.

1002
01:07:01,221 --> 01:07:03,333
That's it. Lovely!
Peter, give us a smile. Lovely.

1003
01:07:03,505 --> 01:07:05,246
All right, when you're ready, Bill.

1004
01:07:05,978 --> 01:07:08,067
Mr Hartnell to you, sonny.

1005
01:07:08,853 --> 01:07:09,632
Sorry.

1006
01:07:10,007 --> 01:07:13,271
You might call me by my first name
if we get to know each other better.

1007
01:07:13,297 --> 01:07:16,644
If you...
if you last on my show, that is.

1008
01:07:18,168 --> 01:07:20,653
Can we go from the top of the scene,
Mr Hartnell?

1009
01:07:20,679 --> 01:07:23,420
You make the TV screen come on.
The scanner.

1010
01:07:23,882 --> 01:07:25,206
Scanner, right.

1011
01:07:25,217 --> 01:07:28,297
And then you flick the switch
and the doors open.

1012
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:31,059
- No, no. Can't do that.
- Beg pardon?

1013
01:07:31,108 --> 01:07:32,806
I'd have to move
round to the other side.

1014
01:07:32,831 --> 01:07:34,978
That's where the door switch is.

1015
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:39,347
- Does it matter?
- Of course it matters!

1016
01:07:39,458 --> 01:07:42,934
All right. We'll work around it.
You move where you like...

1017
01:07:43,012 --> 01:07:45,367
- Mr Hartnell.
- Thank you. I will.

1018
01:07:45,612 --> 01:07:47,568
Okay. Top of the scene, then.

1019
01:07:49,925 --> 01:07:53,710
The glass cylinder
should be going up and down.

1020
01:07:53,836 --> 01:07:57,423
- The ship is in flight.
- Right. Yes. Sorry.

1021
01:08:03,302 --> 01:08:06,028
- Well?
- Sorry. Be right with you.

1022
01:08:14,813 --> 01:08:16,975
Anybody know how to make it go?

1023
01:08:17,015 --> 01:08:20,139
For Christ's sake! Doesn't anyone
know how to do anything?

1024
01:08:21,077 --> 01:08:24,240
Out you go, out, out.
I'll sort it myself.

1025
01:08:38,333 --> 01:08:40,337
Red light, and bell.

1026
01:08:40,851 --> 01:08:42,645
Roll to record.

1027
01:08:43,256 --> 01:08:46,661
In 15, 14...

1028
01:08:47,322 --> 01:08:49,261
Quiet, please, everyone.

1029
01:08:49,802 --> 01:08:53,346
OK, everyone ready? Ready now.

1030
01:08:54,122 --> 01:08:56,363
There's a... Ten...

1031
01:08:56,595 --> 01:08:59,252
..a lot of people
dancing about in my eyeline.

1032
01:08:59,472 --> 01:09:04,268
It's very off-putting. Do you mind?
Thank you...five, four...

1033
01:09:07,965 --> 01:09:11,844
Now...they've all gone.

1034
01:09:13,929 --> 01:09:15,012
All gone.

1035
01:09:17,823 --> 01:09:23,787
None of them ever understood.
Not even young Susan, or...

1036
01:09:31,625 --> 01:09:34,484
..or V-V-Vicki.

1037
01:09:36,252 --> 01:09:41,704
And then there's Barbara
and Chatterton...

1038
01:09:41,715 --> 01:09:43,261
Ch-Ch-Chesterton!

1039
01:09:43,287 --> 01:09:44,997
Oh, God.

1040
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:51,469
Perhaps I should go back
to my own time.

1041
01:09:52,997 --> 01:09:54,582
To my own planet.

1042
01:09:57,193 --> 01:09:58,360
But I...

1043
01:10:00,154 --> 01:10:01,386
I can't...

1044
01:10:03,823 --> 01:10:04,823
I can't...

1045
01:10:07,872 --> 01:10:09,572
Is everything okay?

1046
01:10:09,582 --> 01:10:12,882
I, er...I can't...

1047
01:10:13,461 --> 01:10:15,118
Are you all right?

1048
01:10:15,128 --> 01:10:16,671
I...

1049
01:10:18,465 --> 01:10:20,132
I can't...

1050
01:10:26,077 --> 01:10:28,704
Mr Hartnell? I, er...

1051
01:10:31,483 --> 01:10:33,061
Mr Hartnell?

1052
01:10:47,470 --> 01:10:52,061
Anneke! Anneke, turn to me, love.
Turn to me. Thanks, love.

1053
01:10:52,614 --> 01:10:55,264
I could get used to this.
How about you?

1054
01:10:55,759 --> 01:10:59,195
As you can see...
Yeah, yeah, I hear you.

1055
01:10:59,221 --> 01:11:02,961
It can't go on. He's become
so difficult to work with.

1056
01:11:02,987 --> 01:11:04,945
And his lines... I hear you!

1057
01:11:06,347 --> 01:11:08,631
The poor man's worn out.

1058
01:11:08,957 --> 01:11:12,632
Shame. Goddamn shame.

1059
01:11:14,094 --> 01:11:18,061
- So, that's that, I suppose.
- What do you mean?

1060
01:11:18,850 --> 01:11:22,828
Well, we can't have Doctor Who
without Doctor Who, can we?

1061
01:11:37,472 --> 01:11:39,345
Pop, pop, pop.

1062
01:11:44,273 --> 01:11:48,667
- Sampa! Sampa! Sampa!
- Oh, hello there.

1063
01:11:48,694 --> 01:11:51,328
Where are you going to take
the TARDIS next, Sampa?

1064
01:11:51,354 --> 01:11:53,177
Oh, I don't know, darling.

1065
01:11:53,409 --> 01:11:56,259
Miss says you should go back in
time and see Oliver Cromwell

1066
01:11:56,284 --> 01:11:58,251
and tell him not to be so horrible.

1067
01:11:58,277 --> 01:11:59,809
Yes, maybe I should.

1068
01:11:59,835 --> 01:12:03,033
But I want the butterfly men
to come back! They were pretty.

1069
01:12:03,182 --> 01:12:05,760
We did them at school
and I was a Zarbi.

1070
01:12:05,786 --> 01:12:08,682
Listen, Judi... They could have
a big fight with the Daleks

1071
01:12:08,751 --> 01:12:11,045
and you could fly on their backs
with a bow and arrow.

1072
01:12:11,292 --> 01:12:12,408
Listen, darling.

1073
01:12:12,435 --> 01:12:15,635
You mustn't expect too much
from your old grandfather, you know.

1074
01:12:16,194 --> 01:12:18,399
I get very tired
these days and, er...

1075
01:12:18,453 --> 01:12:21,789
Graham Potter says the TARDIS
will run out of petrol soon.

1076
01:12:21,815 --> 01:12:25,975
I need to take things a bit easier.
But I told him he was stupid.

1077
01:12:26,002 --> 01:12:29,686
The TARDIS will go on and on for
ever because it's special and magic.

1078
01:12:29,712 --> 01:12:31,524
- Like my Sampa.
-Well, I...

1079
01:12:31,551 --> 01:12:34,542
My Sampa's Doctor Who
and he can do anything.

1080
01:12:43,189 --> 01:12:46,222
I hope you don't think it
presumptuous of me

1081
01:12:46,250 --> 01:12:48,349
to ask for this meeting, Sydney...

1082
01:12:48,359 --> 01:12:50,682
Presumptuous?
Hell, no, Bill.

1083
01:12:51,555 --> 01:12:55,873
- I was going to ask you to
come in, as it happens.
- Oh, yes?

1084
01:12:56,252 --> 01:13:01,095
Yeah. Yeah. Things...

1085
01:13:02,716 --> 01:13:05,069
Things can't go on the way they are.

1086
01:13:08,167 --> 01:13:10,828
Exactly! Exactly, Sydney!

1087
01:13:11,033 --> 01:13:15,204
I'm committed to Doctor Who,
100% committed, but...

1088
01:13:17,158 --> 01:13:18,606
..well, I need more time off.

1089
01:13:19,536 --> 01:13:22,061
Bloody schedule
would kill a man half my age.

1090
01:13:22,087 --> 01:13:24,452
A-ha. All those lines they give me.

1091
01:13:24,478 --> 01:13:26,725
The kiddies don't want
to hear all that waffle.

1092
01:13:27,684 --> 01:13:30,141
But perhaps it would be best
if the writers just...

1093
01:13:30,167 --> 01:13:35,610
sort of sketched in the story
and left me to make up the rest.

1094
01:13:36,197 --> 01:13:38,702
No, no.
That's probably a step too far.

1095
01:13:38,728 --> 01:13:43,872
But you take my meaning.
I'm the star of the show.

1096
01:13:44,663 --> 01:13:45,659
I'm the Doctor.

1097
01:13:45,685 --> 01:13:49,278
And, er, if we're to continue,
you have to take account of that.

1098
01:13:49,591 --> 01:13:50,359
Proper account.

1099
01:13:50,385 --> 01:13:53,645
We've got great plans for
Doctor Who, Bill, believe you me.

1100
01:13:53,671 --> 01:13:55,369
Great plans. Well, I'm, er...

1101
01:13:55,395 --> 01:13:57,983
We're 100% committed too.
Very glad to hear it.

1102
01:13:58,009 --> 01:14:00,606
But we're looking at ways
of refreshing it.

1103
01:14:01,939 --> 01:14:02,850
Um...regenerating it.

1104
01:14:02,877 --> 01:14:06,625
Well, yes. Quite right.
Spice things up a bit. Bill...

1105
01:14:06,650 --> 01:14:09,479
I'm glad we're on
the same wavelength anyway.

1106
01:14:09,505 --> 01:14:12,904
Ah, hell, Bill, there's no
easy way of saying this. Um...

1107
01:14:15,996 --> 01:14:18,207
We want Doctor Who to go on.

1108
01:14:18,275 --> 01:14:19,131
Yes.

1109
01:14:21,362 --> 01:14:23,197
But not with you.

1110
01:14:27,436 --> 01:14:31,439
Like you said,
things have got to change.

1111
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:37,765
I see.

1112
01:14:44,650 --> 01:14:49,019
Who...who have you got in mind?

1113
01:14:49,650 --> 01:14:51,978
You're a hard act to follow, Bill.

1114
01:14:52,289 --> 01:14:55,347
No need for soft soap, Sydney.
You know me better.

1115
01:14:55,547 --> 01:14:56,658
Who?

1116
01:15:06,782 --> 01:15:07,726
You approve?

1117
01:15:07,752 --> 01:15:12,489
Oh, yes, yes, quite.
Patrick Troughton.

1118
01:15:13,430 --> 01:15:14,979
Excellent choice.

1119
01:15:19,779 --> 01:15:21,530
I'm so sorry, Bill.

1120
01:15:26,094 --> 01:15:33,006
"Fortune, good night,
smile once more, turn thy wheel."

1121
01:15:33,324 --> 01:15:34,408
Huh?

1122
01:15:35,182 --> 01:15:39,833
King Lear.
I did it once. Carried a spear.

1123
01:15:40,212 --> 01:15:41,729
Long time ago.

1124
01:15:42,958 --> 01:15:46,545
Long, long time ago.

1125
01:16:09,953 --> 01:16:11,872
Everything all right, sir?

1126
01:16:13,372 --> 01:16:15,082
Are you okay?

1127
01:16:16,327 --> 01:16:18,801
You need to move along now, sir.

1128
01:16:19,537 --> 01:16:21,301
Sir?

1129
01:16:23,164 --> 01:16:24,542
You're in the way.

1130
01:16:26,207 --> 01:16:30,284
I'm sorry, sir, but...
'Ere, aren't you...?

1131
01:16:30,427 --> 01:16:33,692
I'm, er, sorry, very sorry, officer.

1132
01:16:33,783 --> 01:16:35,756
- You're him, aren't you?
- Very sorry, officer.

1133
01:16:35,783 --> 01:16:37,425
You're Doctor Who.

1134
01:16:39,270 --> 01:16:43,731
Wait till I tell the kids.
They bloomin' love you!

1135
01:16:58,429 --> 01:17:01,282
Well, it's, er, been agreed by, um...

1136
01:17:02,108 --> 01:17:07,725
by mutual consent that I should,
er...pack it in.

1137
01:17:09,966 --> 01:17:10,764
Er...

1138
01:17:11,793 --> 01:17:14,462
Oh, right. Give it up.

1139
01:17:16,979 --> 01:17:18,069
I see.

1140
01:17:28,922 --> 01:17:35,171
Well...I think it's for the best,
love. Truly, I do.

1141
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:38,766
You can't go on like this.

1142
01:17:39,748 --> 01:17:43,457
And I've made my mark.
Shown everyone I can do it.

1143
01:17:43,569 --> 01:17:48,229
I'm sure it'll lead to lots more
interesting stuff, hm?

1144
01:17:49,347 --> 01:17:50,306
Yes.

1145
01:18:01,001 --> 01:18:03,117
Well, I'll make us
a nice cup of tea.

1146
01:18:06,141 --> 01:18:08,756
I...I...

1147
01:18:10,541 --> 01:18:12,150
I don't want to go.

1148
01:18:16,256 --> 01:18:19,655
I...I don't want to go.

1149
01:18:22,750 --> 01:18:24,490
Oh...

1150
01:18:24,516 --> 01:18:26,310
Oh, Bill.

1151
01:18:48,516 --> 01:18:50,262
Well, then. Who's Who?

1152
01:18:54,813 --> 01:18:57,802
I won't lie to you.
I'm scared stiff.

1153
01:18:57,891 --> 01:19:01,421
Oh, you'll be fine.
In fact, you'll be wonderful.

1154
01:19:02,176 --> 01:19:03,253
I...I told them, you know,

1155
01:19:03,297 --> 01:19:05,435
there's only one man in England
who can take over.

1156
01:19:05,462 --> 01:19:07,255
Oh? Couldn't they get him?

1157
01:19:31,251 --> 01:19:32,962
Red light, and bell.

1158
01:19:37,341 --> 01:19:43,555
Okay, positions, everyone, please.
And roll to record in 15...

1159
01:21:30,734 --> 01:21:35,582
'I want you to belong somewhere,
to have roots of your own.

1160
01:21:35,653 --> 01:21:38,372
'With David, you'll be able
to find those roots,

1161
01:21:38,398 --> 01:21:40,967
'live normally,

1162
01:21:41,448 --> 01:21:44,948

Yes, I shall come back.
