1
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:29,170
See you tomorrow.

2
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:49,525
Oh, my God!

3
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:13,674
I'm in.

4
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,580
We're almost there.

5
00:04:08,747 --> 00:04:12,709
- Sir, are you sure about this?
- I told you, we're going to be all right.

6
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:18,339
I understand, sir. It's just that I'm scoping
some serious sentinel activity up here.

7
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:58,922
- Link.
- Yes, sir?

8
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:02,216
Given your situation, I can't say
I understand your reasons ...

9
00:05:02,384 --> 00:05:05,052
 ... for volunteering to operate
onboard my ship.

10
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:09,223
However, if you wish to continue to
do so, I must ask you to do one thing.

11
00:05:09,766 --> 00:05:11,225
What's that, sir?

12
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,269
To trust me.

13
00:05:13,437 --> 00:05:15,396
Yes, sir. I will, sir.

14
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:20,610
- I mean, I do, sir.
- I hope so.

15
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:24,156
Re-patch the main AC to the hard drives
and stand by to broadcast.

16
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,406
Yes, sir.

17
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,500
Still can't sleep?

18
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:39,838
You wanna talk?

19
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,550
They're just dreams.

20
00:05:46,887 --> 00:05:49,264
If you're afraid of something ... .

21
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:51,266
I just wish ... .

22
00:05:51,933 --> 00:05:54,185
I wish I knew what I'm supposed to do.

23
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:56,187
That's all.

24
00:05:57,105 --> 00:05:58,689
I just wish I knew.

25
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:03,110
She's gonna call. Don't worry.

26
00:06:03,278 --> 00:06:04,321
Here you are.

27
00:06:04,488 --> 00:06:07,949
- Are we ready to go?
- We're already late.

28
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:12,745
These geotherms confirm
the last transmission of the Osiris.

29
00:06:13,497 --> 00:06:15,165
The machines are digging.

30
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:19,127
They're boring from the surface
straight down to Zion.

31
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:21,879
- Mother --
- They'll avoid the entire perimeter defense.

32
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,548
How fast are they moving?

33
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:27,093
Control estimates their descent
at 100 meters an hour. Shit

34
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:29,721
- How deep are they?
- Almost 2,000 meters.

35
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:33,432
- What about the scans from the Osiris?
- They can't be accurate.

36
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,519
- They may be.
- It's not possible. What

37
00:06:35,685 --> 00:06:38,146
That'd mean there are
a quarter-million sentinels out there.

38
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:39,814
- That's right.
- That can't be.

39
00:06:39,981 --> 00:06:41,649
Why not?

40
00:06:41,817 --> 00:06:45,569
A sentinel for every man,
woman and child in Zion.

41
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:50,492
That sounds exactly like
the thinking of a machine to me.

42
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:52,827
Morpheus, glad you could join us.

43
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:54,495
Niobe.

44
00:06:55,872 --> 00:06:59,250
My apologies to all.
But as you are undoubtedly aware ...

45
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:02,711
 ... it's become increasely difficult to locate
a secure broadcast position.

46
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:06,132
- Squiddies got our best spots.
- Main lines are crawling with them.

47
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,095
And if Niobe's right, in 72 hours
there's gonna be a quarter-million more.

48
00:07:10,262 --> 00:07:11,387
What are we gonna do about it?

49
00:07:11,555 --> 00:07:13,848
We're gonna do what
Commander Lock ordered us to do.

50
00:07:14,182 --> 00:07:16,768
We'll evacuate broadcast level
and return to Zion.

51
00:07:16,935 --> 00:07:22,064
And does the commander have a plan
for stopping 250,000 sentinels?

52
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:24,901
A strategy is still being formulated.

53
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,735
I'm sure it is.

54
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,752
What do you think
we should do, Morpheus?

55
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,088
-Proceed as ordered ...
-What is - t?

56
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:47,298
I don't know.

57
00:07:47,466 --> 00:07:50,259
 ... however, I must
ask one of you for help.

58
00:07:50,427 --> 00:07:56,141
Some of you believe as I believe, some
of you do not. But those of you that do ...

59
00:07:56,308 --> 00:07:58,851
 ... know we are nearing
the end of our struggle.

60
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:03,273
The prophecy will be fulfilled soon.
But before it can be ...

61
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,776
 ... the Oracle must be consulted.

62
00:08:14,701 --> 00:08:16,952
If we return and recharge now ...

63
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,874
 ... we can be back inside within 36 hours, well
before the machines reach this depth.

64
00:08:21,082 --> 00:08:22,918
Do you understand what you're asking?

65
00:08:23,084 --> 00:08:25,920
I am asking that one ship
remain here in our place ...

66
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:28,798
 ... just in case the Oracle
should attempt to contact us.

67
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:32,092
Bullshit. You're asking for one of us
to disobey a direct order.

68
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:36,806
That's right, I am. But we well know
that the reason most of us are here ...

69
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:39,600
 ... is because of our affinity
for disobedience.

70
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,686
What happens when you
get back to Zion ...

71
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,272
 ... and the commander
throws you in the stockade?

72
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,649
He won't.

73
00:08:46,775 --> 00:08:49,985
Goddamn it, Morpheus,
you ain't never gonna change.

74
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:53,447
Shit, I'll do it just to see
what Deadbolt does to you.

75
00:08:53,615 --> 00:08:55,158
You got 36 hours.

76
00:08:57,953 --> 00:08:59,788
I'm looking for Neo.

77
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:03,332
-Never heard of him.
- I have something for him.

78
00:09:04,543 --> 00:09:06,753
A gift.

79
00:09:06,962 --> 00:09:09,839
You see, he set me free.

80
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:14,510
Fine, whatever. Now piss off.

81
00:09:15,053 --> 00:09:16,096
Who was that?

82
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,097
How did you know someone was here?

83
00:09:18,265 --> 00:09:19,724
He gave you this.

84
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,898
He said you set him free.

85
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:31,193
Is everything all right, sir?

86
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,197
The meeting is over.
Retreat to your exits.

87
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,575
- Agents are coming.
- Agents?

88
00:09:37,033 --> 00:09:38,409
Go.

89
00:09:48,211 --> 00:09:49,296
Hiya, fellas.

90
00:09:49,462 --> 00:09:50,588
- It's him.
- The anomaly.

91
00:09:50,755 --> 00:09:52,006
- Do we proceed?
- Yes.

92
00:09:52,173 --> 00:09:54,676
- He is still --
- Only human.

93
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,100
Hm. Upgrades.

94
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:00,575
- That went as expected.
- Yes.

95
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:03,410
It's happening exactly as before.

96
00:11:03,578 --> 00:11:06,246
Well, not exactly.

97
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,086
- What happened back there?
- I can't figure it out.

98
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:13,922
Agents just came out of nowhere.

99
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:17,091
And then the code got all weird.
Encryption I've never seen.

100
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:20,177
- Is Neo okay?
- Okay? Shit, I guess you should've seen him.

101
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,763
Where is he now?

102
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:24,974
He's doing his Superman thing.

103
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,400
Where are you?

104
00:12:21,072 --> 00:12:24,658
This is the Nebuchadnezzar on approach,
requesting access through Gate Three.

105
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:33,168
Nebuchadnezzar, this is Zion Control.
Maintain present velocity and stand by.

106
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:34,836
Roger that, Control.

107
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:38,505
This is Zion Control requesting immediate
stand-down of arms at Gate Three.

108
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:42,509
We have the Nebuchadnezzar
on approach. Let's open her up.

109
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,019
Nebuchadnezzar you are cleared through
Gate Three to Bay Seven.

110
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,895
Roger that, Control.

111
00:13:00,028 --> 00:13:03,114
Door's open, bed's made.
Welcome home.

112
00:13:03,865 --> 00:13:06,033
No place like it.

113
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:23,927
Roger that, Control. Zion Control,
stand by for Gate Three lockdown.

114
00:14:13,434 --> 00:14:15,854
The Nebuchadnezzar is down.
Bay Seven.

115
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,187
Understood.

116
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:28,448
Captain Mifune.

117
00:14:29,534 --> 00:14:30,701
Captain Morpheus.

118
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,705
Are you here to escort me
to the stockade, captain?

119
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,249
- I'm just here to keep the peace.
- Commander Lock demands --

120
00:14:38,543 --> 00:14:41,712
Requests your immediate counsel, sir.

121
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:44,465
- Link.
- Sir?

122
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:47,217
I want the ship ready to go
as soon as possible.

123
00:14:47,385 --> 00:14:48,927
Understood, sir.

124
00:14:56,102 --> 00:14:58,520
- What is it between them?
- Morpheus and Lock?

125
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:01,816
- Niobe.
- Captain Niobe?

126
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:05,193
She used to be with Morpheus.
Now she's with Lock.

127
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:08,030
What happened?

128
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,658
Morpheus went to the Oracle.
After that, everything changed.

129
00:15:11,826 --> 00:15:14,495
Yeah, she can do that.

130
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:15,830
Neo!

131
00:15:16,831 --> 00:15:19,708
- Oh, no.
- How does he always know?

132
00:15:19,876 --> 00:15:21,836
Doesn't he have anything better to do?

133
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:24,713
You know what they say
about the life you save.

134
00:15:24,881 --> 00:15:26,673
I didn't save his life.

135
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,219
Hiya, Neo.

136
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:34,014
- Trinity, Link.
- Hey.

137
00:15:34,182 --> 00:15:37,851
- It's great to have you back.
- Thanks. It's good to be back.

138
00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:40,772
- Can I carry that for you Neo?
- No, I can carry my own bag.

139
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,606
- Trinity?
- I'm fine.

140
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:46,443
- You can carry these.
- Yeah, sure, Link.

141
00:15:51,366 --> 00:15:55,870
Hey, you know, next year
I'm old enough to join a crew, right?

142
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,789
I've been thinking a lot about it,
and I've made my decision.

143
00:15:58,957 --> 00:16:00,416
Let me guess.

144
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,876
I want to join the Nebuchadnezzar.

145
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:07,423
I know Morpheus hasn't filled the other
crew positions, except for you, Link.

146
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:08,966
I'm sure he has reasons ...

147
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:12,470
 ... but the more I think about it,
the more I think it's meant to be.

148
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,179
You know, it's fate.

149
00:16:14,347 --> 00:16:15,889
You're the reason I'm here, Neo.

150
00:16:16,057 --> 00:16:18,600
I told you kid, you found me.
I didn't find you.

151
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:21,312
I know, but you got me out.
You saved me.

152
00:16:22,438 --> 00:16:24,065
You saved yourself.

153
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:43,668
- Morpheus.
- Commander Lock.

154
00:16:43,918 --> 00:16:48,423
I spoke to the other captains. I wanted to
offer you a chance to explain your actions.

155
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:51,466
I wasn't aware that my actions
required any explanation.

156
00:16:51,634 --> 00:16:53,927
You were given a direct order
to return to Zion.

157
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,931
- I did.
- But you asked for one ship to remain behind.

158
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,767
I would have stayed,
but I needed to recharge my ship.

159
00:16:59,934 --> 00:17:02,644
So you admit to a direct contravention
of your duty.

160
00:17:02,812 --> 00:17:06,231
Commander we need a presence inside the Matrix
to await contact from the Oracle.

161
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,358
I don't want to hear that shit!

162
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:11,194
I don't care about oracles
or prophecies or messiahs!

163
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:14,781
I care about one thing: Stopping that
army from destroying this city.

164
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,785
And to do that I need soldiers
to obey my orders.

165
00:17:17,952 --> 00:17:22,539
With all due respect, commander,
there is only one way to save our city.

166
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,125
How?

167
00:17:24,292 --> 00:17:27,086
- Neo.
- Goddamn it, Morpheus.

168
00:17:27,253 --> 00:17:29,881
Not everyone believes what you believe.

169
00:17:30,048 --> 00:17:32,133
My beliefs do not require them to.

170
00:17:40,308 --> 00:17:44,228
There's a gathering tonight. Everyone's
talking. A lot of people are scared.

171
00:17:44,395 --> 00:17:47,147
No one remembers the last time
so many ships were docked.

172
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:50,276
- Something is happening, isn't it?
- Something big. Hey.

173
00:17:50,443 --> 00:17:53,613
We're not allowed to say anything,
so stop asking.

174
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:02,038
Goddamn, it's good to be home.

175
00:18:15,051 --> 00:18:18,011
I'll recommended to the council that you
be removed from duty.

176
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,515
That is, of course,
your prerogative, commander.

177
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:24,559
If it were up to me Captain, you wouldn't set foot
on a ship for the rest of your life.

178
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:27,480
Then I am grateful that
it is not up to you.

179
00:18:33,945 --> 00:18:36,364
- Councillor Hamann.
- Commander.

180
00:18:37,031 --> 00:18:39,741
- Captain.
- Councillor.

181
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:43,287
Council's asked me to speak tonight
at the temple gathering.

182
00:18:43,454 --> 00:18:47,541
The presence of the fleet and the
persistence of rumors must be addressed.

183
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:50,211
The people must be told
what is happening.

184
00:18:50,378 --> 00:18:52,087
Of course, councillor.

185
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:58,051
But might I advise a level of discretion
concerning specific details.

186
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,221
- We do not wish to start a panic.
- Quite right.

187
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,474
A panic is not what anyone wants.

188
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:07,979
What about you, captain?
What would you advise?

189
00:19:10,398 --> 00:19:15,153
The truth. No one will panic,
because there is nothing to fear.

190
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:17,445
That army won't never reach
the gates of Zion.

191
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,826
- What makes you so sure?
- Consider what we have seen, councillor.

192
00:19:21,993 --> 00:19:23,869
Consider that in the past six months ...

193
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:26,079
 ... we have freed more minds
than in six years.

194
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:29,250
This attack is an act of desperation.

195
00:19:29,417 --> 00:19:33,253
I believe very soon the prophecy
will be fulfilled and this war will end.

196
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:37,258
I hope you're right, captain.

197
00:19:37,425 --> 00:19:40,135
I do not believe it to be
a matter of hope, councillor.

198
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:42,888
It is simply a matter of time.

199
00:19:45,057 --> 00:19:46,517
My stop.

200
00:19:46,684 --> 00:19:48,102
See you soon.

201
00:19:48,269 --> 00:19:49,729
Hopefully not too soon.

202
00:19:49,896 --> 00:19:53,065
Let's go, kid.
These two got things to do.

203
00:20:02,491 --> 00:20:04,242
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

204
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:06,828
I am if you're thinking
this elevator is too damn slow.

205
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:10,333
- How long do we charge the Neb?
- Twenty-four, maybe 30 hours.

206
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,711
Some people go their entire lives
without hearing news that good.

207
00:20:39,153 --> 00:20:43,490
Neo, please, I have a son,
Jacob, aboard the Gnosis.

208
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:47,161
- Please, watch over him.
- I'll try.

209
00:20:47,328 --> 00:20:49,413
I have a daughter on the Icarus.

210
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,499
No, wait.

211
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:54,167
It's all right. They need you.

212
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,586
- I need you.
- I know.

213
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,423
There's time.

214
00:21:04,387 --> 00:21:06,513
Where's my puss --?

215
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:09,016
- Hey!
- Uncle Link!

216
00:21:09,183 --> 00:21:10,809
God!

217
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,936
Uncle Link!

218
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:16,691
Oh, my God! You're so huge!

219
00:21:16,857 --> 00:21:19,026
- You should be picking me up!
- No!

220
00:21:19,193 --> 00:21:20,736
- Yeah!
- Okay!

221
00:21:20,903 --> 00:21:22,613
Okay? All right.

222
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:25,825
Now, we're gonna have
to work together here, okay?

223
00:21:25,992 --> 00:21:28,201
One, two, three, lift!

224
00:21:28,369 --> 00:21:31,538
Oh, my God!
What are you feeding these two?

225
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:34,416
Come on, kids. It's time to go.

226
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:37,545
- Hey, Cas.
- Hey.

227
00:21:38,087 --> 00:21:40,631
- Good to have you home, Link.
- Good to be home.

228
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:42,633
You be careful with her.

229
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,594
Don't worry about me.
He's the one that's gonna get it.

230
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,807
Out the door! Both of you, march!

231
00:21:49,974 --> 00:21:52,018
- Bye!
- Bye!

232
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,942
I'm gonna get what?

233
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:05,323
Every ship up there's been home two, even
three times more than the Nebuchadnezzar.

234
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:09,326
Come on, Zee.
I thought we were past this.

235
00:22:09,493 --> 00:22:12,913
- We'll get past this when you stop operating another ship.
- I can't do that.

236
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,582
- Why?
- You know why.

237
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,917
If Dozer knew how I felt,
he wouldn't have asked you to do this.

238
00:22:18,627 --> 00:22:21,172
Maybe. But it's too late now.

239
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:23,965
I made a promise,
and some promises can't be unmade.

240
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:26,844
- It's not fair.
- Nobody said it was gonna be.

241
00:22:27,011 --> 00:22:29,971
You think Cas thinks it's fair
that I'm here and Dozer's not?

242
00:22:35,895 --> 00:22:39,105
I lost two brothers to that ship, Link.

243
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,401
I'm afraid of it.

244
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:46,614
I'm afraid it's gonna take you too.

245
00:22:47,281 --> 00:22:49,115
It won't.

246
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:51,117
How can you say that to me?

247
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:53,244
Because of Morpheus.

248
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:58,041
Because of what he's told me. He said
that this is it, that it will be over soon.

249
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:02,421
- Link, Morpheus is crazy.
- No doubt.

250
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:06,133
But Tank and Dozer believed him.
And I'll tell you what ...

251
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:11,638
 ... after being on that ship and seeing Neo
do the things he can do, I gotta say ...

252
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,848
 ... I'm starting to believe him too.

253
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,398
Be careful, Link.

254
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:29,115
Please be careful.

255
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:41,626
- They started yet?
- Only Councillor Hamann's opening prayer.

256
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:44,880
Tonight, let us honor
these men and women.

257
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:47,674
These are our soldiers, our warriors.

258
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:52,096
These are our husbands and wives,
our brothers and sisters ...

259
00:23:52,263 --> 00:23:53,931
 ... our children.

260
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:57,643
Let us remember those
that have been lost ...

261
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:01,020
 ... and let us give thanks
for those that have been found ...

262
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:04,482
 ... and who stand here beside us.

263
00:24:04,692 --> 00:24:08,362
Now I would like someone else
to close this prayer ...

264
00:24:08,529 --> 00:24:11,740
 ... someone who hasn't spoken here
in a long time ...

265
00:24:11,907 --> 00:24:17,288
 ... but who I believe has something to say
that we all need to hear.

266
00:24:18,289 --> 00:24:19,874
I give you Morpheus.

267
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:43,564
Zion! Hear me!

268
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:47,692
It is true what many of you have heard.

269
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:51,864
The machines have gathered
an army, and as I speak ...

270
00:24:52,031 --> 00:24:55,951
 ... that army is drawing nearer to our home.

271
00:24:57,412 --> 00:25:02,082
Believe me when I say we have
a difficult time ahead of us.

272
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:08,923
But if we are to be prepared for it,
we must first shed our fear of it.

273
00:25:09,423 --> 00:25:14,345
I stand here before you now
truthfully unafraid.

274
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,680
Why?

275
00:25:17,097 --> 00:25:19,933
Because I believe something you do not?

276
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:21,935
No!

277
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:27,191
I stand here without fear
because I remember.

278
00:25:27,358 --> 00:25:31,278
I remember that I am here not because
of the path that lies before me ...

279
00:25:31,445 --> 00:25:34,781
 ... but because of the path
that lies behind me.

280
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:39,619
I remember that for 100 years
we have fought these machines.

281
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:44,541
I remember that for 100 years
they have sent their armies to destroy us.

282
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:50,798
And after a century of war,
I remember that which matters most:

283
00:25:51,674 --> 00:25:54,676
We are still here!

284
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,477
Tonight ...

285
00:26:03,644 --> 00:26:07,021
 ... let us send a message to that army.

286
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:10,233
Tonight, let us shake this cave.

287
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:14,279
Tonight, let us tremble these halls ...

288
00:26:14,446 --> 00:26:17,575
 ... of earth, steel and stone.

289
00:26:17,741 --> 00:26:22,997
Let us be heard from red core
to black sky.

290
00:26:23,163 --> 00:26:27,710
Tonight, let us make them remember:

291
00:26:27,876 --> 00:26:32,839
This is Zion and we are not afraid!

292
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:58,198
I remember.

293
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:01,451
I remember you used to dance.

294
00:27:03,078 --> 00:27:06,373
I remember you were pretty good.

295
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:10,376
There are some things in this world,
Captain Niobe ...

296
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:13,963
 ... that will never change.

297
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:17,175
Niobe!

298
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,641
Some things do change.

299
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,744
Excuse me.

300
00:27:56,590 --> 00:28:00,094
- I missed you.
- I can tell.

301
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:04,263
I was thinking, everyone is here.

302
00:28:04,807 --> 00:28:07,101
Follow me.

303
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:31,680
Neo, what is it?

304
00:31:31,972 --> 00:31:34,223
What's wrong?

305
00:31:35,809 --> 00:31:38,144
It's okay, you can tell me.

306
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:41,022
Trinity ... .

307
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:43,983
Don't be afraid.

308
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:46,486
I can't lose you.

309
00:31:46,653 --> 00:31:48,529
You're not gonna lose me.

310
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:55,537
You feel this?

311
00:31:55,704 --> 00:31:57,497
I'm never letting go.

312
00:32:34,701 --> 00:32:37,371
Good night, Zion.

313
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:40,207
Sweet dreams.

314
00:32:50,384 --> 00:32:52,051
- You all right?
- I'll make it.

315
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,846
Did you see that agent?
I've never seen anything like that.

316
00:32:55,013 --> 00:32:57,098
It doesn't matter now.
All that matters is this.

317
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:59,558
You first.

318
00:33:10,445 --> 00:33:13,323
- Oh, God.
- "Smith" will suffice.

319
00:33:25,252 --> 00:33:28,547
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

320
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:21,807
- Care for some company?
- Councillor Hamann.

321
00:34:22,684 --> 00:34:25,519
I don't want to intrude
if you'd prefer to be alone.

322
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:29,523
- No, I could probably use some company.
- Good.

323
00:34:29,983 --> 00:34:32,360
So could I.

324
00:34:35,489 --> 00:34:37,990
It's nice tonight.

325
00:34:38,492 --> 00:34:40,911
Very calm.

326
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,829
It feels like everyone is sleeping
very peacefully.

327
00:34:44,206 --> 00:34:46,666
Not everyone.

328
00:34:46,958 --> 00:34:51,670
I hate sleeping.
I never sleep more than a few hours.

329
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:55,884
I figure I slept the first 11 years
of my life, now I'm making up for it.

330
00:34:56,344 --> 00:35:01,056
- What about you?
- I just haven't been able to sleep much.

331
00:35:02,516 --> 00:35:05,684
- It's a good sign.
- Of what?

332
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:09,021
That you are in fact still human.

333
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:16,530
Have you ever been
to the engineering level?

334
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:19,740
I love to walk there at night.
It's quite amazing.

335
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:22,452
- Would you like to see it?
- Sure.

336
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:37,592
Almost no one comes down here.
Unless, of course, there's a problem.

337
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,847
That's how it is with people. Nobody cares
how it works as long as it works.

338
00:35:43,014 --> 00:35:45,307
I like it down here.

339
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:51,273
I like to be reminded this city survives
because of these machines.

340
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:56,570
These machines are keeping us alive
while other machines are coming to kill us.

341
00:35:56,987 --> 00:36:01,824
Interesting, isn't it?
The power to give life ...

342
00:36:01,992 --> 00:36:05,202
 ... and the power to end it.
- We have the same power.

343
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:08,081
Yeah, I suppose we do, but ...

344
00:36:08,248 --> 00:36:11,710
 ... down here sometimes I think about those people
still plugged into the Matrix.

345
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:14,880
And when I look at these machines ...

346
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:20,135
 ... I can't help thinking that, in a way,
we are plugged into them.

347
00:36:20,427 --> 00:36:23,304
But we control these machines,
they don't control us.

348
00:36:23,722 --> 00:36:26,724
Of course not. How could they?

349
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:29,436
The idea is pure nonsense ...

350
00:36:29,936 --> 00:36:33,063
 ... but it does make one wonder just ...

351
00:36:33,231 --> 00:36:34,815
 ... what is control?

352
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:38,110
If we wanted, we could
shut these machines down.

353
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:42,949
Of course. That's it. You hit it.
That's control, isn't it?

354
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:46,952
If we wanted,
we could smash them to bits.

355
00:36:47,204 --> 00:36:51,333
Although if we did, we'd have to consider
what would happen to our lights ...

356
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:54,168
 ... our heat, our air.

357
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:59,298
So we need machines and they need us.
Is that your point, councillor?

358
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:02,092
No. No point.

359
00:37:02,802 --> 00:37:06,889
Old men like me don't bother
with making points. There's no point.

360
00:37:07,682 --> 00:37:11,478
Is that why there are no young men
on the Council?

361
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,313
Good point.

362
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:18,193
Why don't you tell me
what's on your mind, councillor.

363
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:21,612
There is so much in this world ...

364
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:24,699
 ... that I do not understand.

365
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:31,248
See that machine? It has something to do
with recycling our water supply.

366
00:37:31,414 --> 00:37:34,416
I have absolutely no idea how it works.

367
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:38,672
But I do understand the reason
for it to work.

368
00:37:40,173 --> 00:37:44,677
I have absolutely no idea how you
are able to do some of the things you do.

369
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:49,014
But I believe there's a reason for that
as well.

370
00:37:49,891 --> 00:37:55,021
I only hope we understand that reason
before it's too late.

371
00:38:01,528 --> 00:38:03,195
- Ballard.
- Is he here?

372
00:38:05,615 --> 00:38:08,201
Neo, it's from the Oracle.

373
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:12,871
It's time to go.

374
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:16,293
Morpheus said this was how
it was gonna happen.

375
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:20,880
I don't know. Maybe the prophecy's true,
maybe it's not.

376
00:38:21,423 --> 00:38:24,592
All I know is, that ship needs an operator.

377
00:38:26,177 --> 00:38:28,054
Right now, that operator's me.

378
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:30,764
I know.

379
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,396
- Zee ... .
- I want you to wear it.

380
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:40,650
- You know I don't believe in this stuff.
- But I do.

381
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:43,902
It's always brought me luck.

382
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:48,199
- Maybe it'll bring me you.
- I'm coming back.

383
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:52,911
I promise. No matter what it takes,
I'm coming home.

384
00:38:53,621 --> 00:38:57,250
Just keep it with you. Please.

385
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:59,501
For me.

386
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:04,215
Okay.

387
00:39:23,693 --> 00:39:25,862
- Neo!
- How the hell --?

388
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,447
Bane.

389
00:39:28,615 --> 00:39:29,949
Is something wrong?

390
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:31,826
No, I'm fine.

391
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:34,788
I just wanted to catch you to say ...

392
00:39:34,954 --> 00:39:36,789
 ... good luck.

393
00:39:38,458 --> 00:39:40,168
Thanks.

394
00:39:40,335 --> 00:39:42,753
We'll see you.

395
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:47,425
Neo! Just in time.

396
00:39:47,592 --> 00:39:49,927
- You're gonna see the Oracle. Aren't you?
- We don't have time.

397
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:51,721
I had to give something to Neo.

398
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:55,141
A gift from one of the orphans.

399
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:58,728
He made me swear to get it to you
before you left.

400
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:02,065
He said you'd understand.

401
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:06,860
Thanks.

402
00:40:13,952 --> 00:40:16,871
I was just told you cleared
the Nebuchadnezzar for takeoff.

403
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:18,998
That is correct.

404
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:21,126
Councilor am I still in charge
of our defense system?

405
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:22,585
Of course.

406
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:27,340
I believe I need every ship we have
if we're going to survive this attack.

407
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:30,092
I understand that, commander.

408
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:32,846
Then why did you allow
the Nebuchadnezzar to leave?

409
00:40:33,012 --> 00:40:37,891
Because I believe our survival depends
on more than how many ships we have.

410
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:42,688
Be careful.

411
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,927
Hello.

412
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:27,775
- You seek the Oracle.
- Who are you?

413
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:35,324
I am Seraph. I can take you to her,
but first I must apologize.

414
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:37,284
Apologize for what?

415
00:41:37,952 --> 00:41:39,746
For this.

416
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:39,304
Good.

417
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:44,978
The Oracle has many enemies.
I had to be sure.

418
00:42:45,144 --> 00:42:47,355
- Of what?
- That you are the One.

419
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:51,568
- You could have just asked.
- No. You do not truly know someone ...

420
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:53,987
 ... until you fight them.

421
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:57,990
Come. She's waiting.

422
00:43:13,047 --> 00:43:14,923
Where the hell did they go?

423
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:18,010
These are back doors, aren't they?

424
00:43:18,177 --> 00:43:21,097
Programmer access.

425
00:43:22,181 --> 00:43:25,934
- How do they work?
- A code is hidden in tumblers.

426
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:31,106
One position opens a lock and another
position opens one of these doors.

427
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:35,695
Are you a programmer?

428
00:43:35,862 --> 00:43:38,197
Then what are you?

429
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:43,869
I protect that which matters most.

430
00:44:03,389 --> 00:44:06,768
Well, come on. I ain't gonna bite you.

431
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:09,978
Come around here
and let me have a look at you.

432
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:15,568
My goodness, look at you.

433
00:44:15,902 --> 00:44:18,737
You turned out all right, didn't you?

434
00:44:18,905 --> 00:44:21,114
How do you feel?

435
00:44:21,282 --> 00:44:24,869
I know you're not sleeping.
We'll get to that.

436
00:44:25,036 --> 00:44:27,746
Why don't you come
and have a sit this time.

437
00:44:28,456 --> 00:44:32,585
- Maybe I'll stand.
- Well, suit yourself.

438
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:46,264
- I felt like sitting.
- I know.

439
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:49,351
So ...

440
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:53,856
 ... let's get the obvious stuff
out of the way.

441
00:44:54,148 --> 00:44:58,610
- You're not human, are you?
- It's tough to get more obvious than that.

442
00:44:58,778 --> 00:45:04,617
If I had to guess, I'd say you're
a program from the machine world.

443
00:45:04,992 --> 00:45:09,204
- So is he.
- So far, so good.

444
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:12,541
But if that's true, that could mean
you're part of this system ...

445
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:15,293
 ... another kind of control.

446
00:45:15,461 --> 00:45:19,965
- Keep going.
- I suppose the most obvious question is ...

447
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:24,052
 ... how can I trust you?
- Bingo.

448
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:28,349
It is a pickle, no doubt about it.
Bad news is ...

449
00:45:28,516 --> 00:45:32,186
 ... there's no way you can really know
what around here to help you or not.

450
00:45:32,353 --> 00:45:35,898
So it's really up to you. Just have
to make up your own damn mind ...

451
00:45:36,065 --> 00:45:40,862
 ... to either accept what
I'm going to tell you or reject it.

452
00:45:42,155 --> 00:45:44,322
Candy?

453
00:45:47,034 --> 00:45:51,456
- Do you already know if I'm going to take it?
- Wouldn't be much of an oracle if I didn't.

454
00:45:51,623 --> 00:45:54,833
But if you already know,
how can I make a choice?

455
00:45:55,001 --> 00:45:59,045
Because you didn't come here to make
the choice. You've already made it.

456
00:45:59,213 --> 00:46:03,842
You're here to try to understand
why you made it.

457
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:12,351
I thought you'd have figured that out
by now.

458
00:46:14,103 --> 00:46:16,688
- Why are you here?
- Same reason.

459
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:19,692
I love candy.

460
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:22,695
But why help us?

461
00:46:22,862 --> 00:46:26,364
We're all here to do
what we're all here to do.

462
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:29,994
I'm interested in one thing, Neo:
the future.

463
00:46:30,161 --> 00:46:34,373
And believe me, I know, the only way
to get there is together.

464
00:46:35,208 --> 00:46:40,128
- Are there other programs like you?
- Well, not like me, but ... .

465
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:42,965
Look. See those birds?

466
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:46,594
At some point, a program was written
to govern them.

467
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:52,599
A program was written to watch over the
trees and the wind, the sunrise and sunset.

468
00:46:52,851 --> 00:46:55,728
There are programs running
all over the place.

469
00:46:55,896 --> 00:47:00,358
The ones doing their job, doing what
they were meant to do, are invisible.

470
00:47:00,525 --> 00:47:04,362
You'd never even know they were here.
But the other ones ... .

471
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:08,615
Well, you hear about them all the time.

472
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:12,077
- I've never heard of them.
- Of course you have.

473
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:17,166
Every time you've heard someone
say they saw a ghost or an angel ...

474
00:47:17,333 --> 00:47:21,920
 ... every story you've ever heard about
vampires, werewolves or aliens ...

475
00:47:22,088 --> 00:47:24,422
 ... is the system assimilating
some program ...

476
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:29,262
 ... that's doing something
they're not supposed to be doing.

477
00:47:29,429 --> 00:47:32,431
Programs hacking programs.

478
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:35,476
- Why?
- They have their reasons ...

479
00:47:35,643 --> 00:47:39,605
 ... but usually a program chooses exile
when it faces deletion.

480
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:43,943
- And why would a program be deleted?
- Maybe it breaks down.

481
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:48,655
Maybe a better program is created
to replace it. Happens all the time.

482
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:53,786
And when it does, a program
can either choose to hide here ...

483
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:56,621
 ... or return to the source.

484
00:47:58,291 --> 00:48:01,585
- The machine mainframe.
- Yes.

485
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:04,255
Where you must go.

486
00:48:04,422 --> 00:48:08,634
Where the path of the One ends.
You've seen it ...

487
00:48:09,802 --> 00:48:12,637
 ... in your dreams, haven't you?

488
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:15,641
A door made of light?

489
00:48:17,894 --> 00:48:21,438
What happens when you go through
the door?

490
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:26,568
I see Trinity ...

491
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:29,905
 ... and something happens ...

492
00:48:30,072 --> 00:48:31,990
 ... something bad.

493
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:36,161
She starts to fall,
and then I wake up.

494
00:48:37,204 --> 00:48:41,083
- Do you see her die?
- No.

495
00:48:41,876 --> 00:48:44,920
You have the sight now, Neo.

496
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:48,090
You are looking at the world
without time.

497
00:48:48,257 --> 00:48:50,675
Then why can't I see
what happens to her?

498
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:54,597
We can never see past the choices
we don't understand.

499
00:48:54,764 --> 00:48:57,934
Are you saying I have to choose
whether Trinity lives or dies?

500
00:48:58,184 --> 00:49:01,978
No, you've already made the choice.

501
00:49:02,146 --> 00:49:04,690
Now you have to understand it.

502
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:06,692
No.

503
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:10,112
I can't do that. I won't.

504
00:49:10,822 --> 00:49:13,199
- Well, you have to.
- Why?

505
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:16,869
Because you're the One.

506
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:22,041
What if I can't?

507
00:49:22,208 --> 00:49:24,210
What happens if I fail?

508
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:27,797
Then Zion will fall.

509
00:49:35,262 --> 00:49:40,141
Our time is up. Listen to me, Neo.
You can save Zion ...

510
00:49:40,309 --> 00:49:43,646
 ... if you reach the source, but to do that
you will need the Keymaker.

511
00:49:43,813 --> 00:49:44,855
The Keymaker?

512
00:49:45,023 --> 00:49:48,608
Yes, He disappeared sometime ago. Which we didn't
know what happened to him until now.

513
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:52,530
He's being held prisoner
by a very dangerous program ...

514
00:49:52,697 --> 00:49:56,242
 ... one of the oldest of us.
He is called the Merovingian.

515
00:49:56,409 --> 00:49:59,286
- And he won't let him go willingly.
- What does he want?

516
00:49:59,454 --> 00:50:04,291
What do all men with power want?
More power.

517
00:50:05,001 --> 00:50:08,253
Be there at that exact time ...

518
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:11,090
 ... and you will have a chance.

519
00:50:11,882 --> 00:50:14,135
We must go.

520
00:50:14,302 --> 00:50:19,681
Seems like every time we meet
I got nothing but bad news.

521
00:50:20,266 --> 00:50:23,143
I'm sorry about that. I surely am.

522
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:26,063
But for what it's worth ...

523
00:50:27,106 --> 00:50:30,775
 ... you've made a believer out of me.

524
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:34,195
Good luck, kiddo.

525
00:50:58,137 --> 00:51:00,139
Did you get my package?

526
00:51:00,306 --> 00:51:02,474
- Yeah.
- Well, good.

527
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:06,519
- Smith?
- Whatever it is he's not reading like an agent.

528
00:51:06,688 --> 00:51:10,565
- Surprised to see me?
- No.

529
00:51:10,858 --> 00:51:13,318
- Then you're aware of it.
- Of what?

530
00:51:14,528 --> 00:51:16,530
Our connection.

531
00:51:16,697 --> 00:51:19,365
I don't fully understand how it happened.

532
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:22,911
Perhaps some part of you
imprinted onto me ...

533
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:25,748
 ... something overwritten or copied.

534
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:28,626
It is, at this point, irrelevant.
What matters is ...

535
00:51:28,793 --> 00:51:31,878
 ... that whatever happened,
happened for a reason.

536
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:33,713
And what reason is that?

537
00:51:34,173 --> 00:51:38,135
I killed you, Mr. Anderson.
I watched you die.

538
00:51:38,302 --> 00:51:41,554
With a certain satisfaction,
I might add.

539
00:51:41,722 --> 00:51:45,226
And then something happened,
something that I knew was impossible ...

540
00:51:45,393 --> 00:51:47,228
 ... but it happened anyway.

541
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:51,106
You destroyed me, Mr. Anderson.

542
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:57,695
Afterward, I knew the rules, I understood
what I was supposed to do ...

543
00:51:57,864 --> 00:52:00,865
 ... but I didn't.

544
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:05,204
I couldn't. I was compelled to stay ...

545
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:09,208
 ... compelled to disobey.

546
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:13,545
And now, here I stand
because of you, Mr. Anderson.

547
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:17,675
Because of you, I'm no longer an agent
of this system.

548
00:52:17,842 --> 00:52:21,052
Because of you, I've changed.
I'm unplugged.

549
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:26,057
A new man, so to speak.
Like you, apparently free.

550
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:27,768
Congratulations.

551
00:52:28,519 --> 00:52:30,855
Thank you.

552
00:52:31,438 --> 00:52:36,068
But as you well know,
appearances can be deceiving ...

553
00:52:36,235 --> 00:52:41,407
 ... which brings me back to the reason
why we're here.

554
00:52:41,574 --> 00:52:46,452
We're not here because we're free.
We're here because we are not free.

555
00:52:46,621 --> 00:52:50,541
There's no escaping reason,
no denying purpose.

556
00:52:50,708 --> 00:52:54,085
Because as we both know,
without purpose ...

557
00:52:54,253 --> 00:52:59,090
 ... we would not exist.
- It is purpose that created us.

558
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:02,260
- Purpose that connects us.
- Purpose that pulls us.

559
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:04,262
- That guides us.
- That drives us.

560
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:09,143
- It is purpose that defines.
- Purpose that binds us.

561
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:11,769
We are here because of you,
Mr. Anderson.

562
00:53:11,938 --> 00:53:16,317
We're here to take from you
what you tried to take from us:

563
00:53:18,277 --> 00:53:20,362
Purpose.

564
00:53:23,449 --> 00:53:25,326
- What's happening to him?
- Don't know.

565
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:31,956
Yes, that's it. It'll be over soon.

566
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:21,275
- You.
- Yes, me.

567
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:28,324
Me, me, me.

568
00:55:33,204 --> 00:55:34,871
Me too.

569
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:43,666
More.

570
00:58:45,938 --> 00:58:48,773
It is inevitable.

571
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:50,608
Come on, get out of there.

572
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:36,153
Are you all right?

573
00:59:37,239 --> 00:59:39,157
- It was Smith.
- Yes.

574
00:59:40,034 --> 00:59:42,661
- Now there's more than one?
- A lot more.

575
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:46,623
- How is that possible?
- I don't know.

576
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:49,251
Somehow, he's found a way
to copy himself.

577
00:59:49,418 --> 00:59:53,630
- Is that what he was doing to you?
- I don't know what he was doing ...

578
00:59:53,797 --> 00:59:56,550
 ... but I know what it felt like.
- What?

579
00:59:57,467 --> 01:00:01,179
It felt like I was back in that hallway.

580
01:00:01,347 --> 01:00:02,764
It felt like dying.

581
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:06,143
The machines are tunneling to avoid
our defense system.

582
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:10,146
But I believe they going to intersect
certain pipelines in order to control them.

583
01:00:10,315 --> 01:00:12,858
These points of intersection
are crucial ...

584
01:00:13,025 --> 01:00:15,818
 ... because I believe they're
vulnerable to counterattack.

585
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:20,032
Although it has been suggested that
this is the same kind of attack ...

586
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:23,869
 ... we've defended for years,
I urge the Council to realize the truth.

587
01:00:24,036 --> 01:00:27,371
This is the single greatest threat
we have ever faced ...

588
01:00:27,539 --> 01:00:31,376
 ... and if we do not act accordingly,
we will not survive.

589
01:00:31,543 --> 01:00:35,547
Commander Lock, the Council is well
aware of the seriousness of this attack.

590
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:40,385
You have our leave to prepare our defense
by any and all means necessary.

591
01:00:40,552 --> 01:00:43,221
- Thank you, Council.
- However ...

592
01:00:43,472 --> 01:00:46,807
 ... we ask if there's been word
from the Nebuchadnezzar.

593
01:00:47,059 --> 01:00:49,561
No, councillor. No word. Nothing.

594
01:00:51,188 --> 01:00:55,150
Then we request a ship be dispatched
to ascertain the fate of the One.

595
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:59,070
I wish that were possible, councillor,
but I do not believe our defense ...

596
01:00:59,237 --> 01:01:02,782
 ... can suffer the loss of another ship.
- It will, commander, if it must.

597
01:01:02,949 --> 01:01:05,284
It could take single ship days
to find the Nebuchadnezzar.

598
01:01:05,452 --> 01:01:08,496
- Then send two.
- This is insane.

599
01:01:08,664 --> 01:01:11,666
Careful, commander.

600
01:01:11,876 --> 01:01:15,211
Forgive my frustration, councillors.

601
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:19,257
But I wish I were able to comprehend
the Council's choice in this matter.

602
01:01:19,425 --> 01:01:22,594
Comprehension is not
a requisite of cooperation.

603
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:25,222
If you are asking me
to order two of my captains --

604
01:01:25,389 --> 01:01:27,099
There's no need for such an order.

605
01:01:27,266 --> 01:01:30,811
The captains are present.
They can answer for themselves.

606
01:01:31,269 --> 01:01:36,525
The Council is calling for two volunteers
to aid the Nebuchadnezzar.

607
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:40,862
Are there two among you
that would answer such call?

608
01:01:42,155 --> 01:01:45,951
Captain Soren of the Vigilant
will answer the Council's call.

609
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:49,036
You understand the situation,
Captain Soren?

610
01:01:49,204 --> 01:01:51,664
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you, captain.

611
01:01:53,083 --> 01:01:54,501
Is there another?

612
01:01:55,293 --> 01:01:59,005
- Captain, I think we should volunteer.
- What? You have gone crazy.

613
01:01:59,172 --> 01:02:01,048
- Listen --
- Shut your hole, Bane ...

614
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:02,717
 ... before I put you in one.

615
01:02:12,561 --> 01:02:14,311
Is there no other?

616
01:02:15,063 --> 01:02:16,981
Be hard for any man to risk his life ...

617
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:20,110
 ... especially if he doesn't
understand the reason.

618
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:24,072
Captain Niobe of the Logos
will answer the councillor's call.

619
01:02:24,239 --> 01:02:26,490
- What?
- Thank you, Captain Niobe.

620
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:31,788
Commander Lock, you have your orders.
This Council is hereby adjourned.

621
01:02:36,501 --> 01:02:39,086
- Niobe, what are you doing?
- What I can.

622
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:40,297
Why?

623
01:02:41,590 --> 01:02:44,842
Because some things
never change, Jason ...

624
01:02:45,010 --> 01:02:47,344
 ... and some things do.

625
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,197
What can you see, Neo?

626
01:03:05,364 --> 01:03:07,699
It's strange.
The code is somehow different.

627
01:03:07,867 --> 01:03:09,451
- Encrypted?
- Maybe.

628
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:11,577
Is that good for us or bad for us?

629
01:03:12,288 --> 01:03:15,414
Well, it looks like every floor
is wired with explosives.

630
01:03:16,041 --> 01:03:17,583
Bad for us.

631
01:03:18,001 --> 01:03:19,503
Here we go.

632
01:03:27,512 --> 01:03:30,429
Yes. We are here to speak
with the Merovingian.

633
01:03:30,889 --> 01:03:34,726
Well, of course.
He has been expecting you.

634
01:03:34,893 --> 01:03:35,936
Follow me.

635
01:03:56,623 --> 01:04:00,293
A-ha. Here he is at last.

636
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:03,797
Neo, the One himself.

637
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:05,382
Right?

638
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:07,884
And the legendary Morpheus.

639
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:13,597
And Trinity, of course.
I have heard so much.

640
01:04:13,766 --> 01:04:17,226
You honor me. Please, sit. Join us.
This is my wife, Persephone.

641
01:04:18,144 --> 01:04:21,438
Something to eat? Drink?

642
01:04:21,731 --> 01:04:24,775
Of course, such things are contrivances,
like so much here.

643
01:04:24,943 --> 01:04:27,445
For the sake of appearances.

644
01:04:27,612 --> 01:04:31,074
- No, thank you.
- Yes, of course. Who has time?

645
01:04:31,242 --> 01:04:36,329
Who has time? But then, if we do not ever
take time, how can we ever have time?

646
01:04:40,041 --> 01:04:43,420
Chateau Haut-Briond, 1959.
Magnificent wine.

647
01:04:43,588 --> 01:04:46,505
I love French wine
like I love the French language.

648
01:04:46,673 --> 01:04:50,844
I have sampled every language.
French is my favorite. Fantastic language ...

649
01:04:51,012 --> 01:04:53,137
 ... especially to curse with.

650
01:04:57,143 --> 01:05:01,688
You see? It's like wiping your ass
with silk. I love it.

651
01:05:03,315 --> 01:05:05,065
You know why we are here.

652
01:05:06,818 --> 01:05:11,697
I am a trafficker of information.
I know everything I can.

653
01:05:12,115 --> 01:05:17,954
The question is,
do you know why you are here?

654
01:05:18,246 --> 01:05:20,706
We are looking for the Keymaker.

655
01:05:21,375 --> 01:05:25,878
Oh, yes, it is true.
The Keymaker, of course.

656
01:05:26,047 --> 01:05:29,007
But this is not a reason,
this is not a why.

657
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:32,927
The Keymaker himself, his very nature,
is a means, it is not an end.

658
01:05:33,094 --> 01:05:38,849
And so to look for him is to be
looking for a means to do ...

659
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:42,186
 ... what?
- You know the answer to that question.

660
01:05:42,355 --> 01:05:44,481
But do you?

661
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:47,025
You think you do, but you do not.

662
01:05:47,193 --> 01:05:50,402
You are here
because you were sent here.

663
01:05:50,570 --> 01:05:53,697
You were told to come here,
and then you obeyed.

664
01:05:54,867 --> 01:05:57,202
It is, of course, the way of all things.

665
01:05:57,369 --> 01:06:00,038
You see, there is only one constant ...

666
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:04,376
 ... one universal. It is the only real truth.

667
01:06:04,543 --> 01:06:06,210
Causality.

668
01:06:06,378 --> 01:06:08,672
Action, reaction.

669
01:06:08,838 --> 01:06:13,050
- Cause and effect.
- Everything begins with choice.

670
01:06:13,219 --> 01:06:14,969
No. Wrong.

671
01:06:15,137 --> 01:06:19,724
Choice is an illusion created
between those with power ...

672
01:06:19,891 --> 01:06:21,976
 ... and those without.

673
01:06:23,521 --> 01:06:26,690
Look there at that woman.

674
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:31,318
My God, just look at her ...

675
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:34,239
 ... affecting everyone around her.

676
01:06:34,407 --> 01:06:39,159
So obvious, so bourgeois, so boring.
But wait.

677
01:06:39,411 --> 01:06:43,164
Watch. You see, I have sent her
a dessert ...

678
01:06:43,373 --> 01:06:47,585
 ... a very special dessert.

679
01:06:51,923 --> 01:06:54,384
I wrote it myself.

680
01:06:54,552 --> 01:06:57,762
It starts so simply ...

681
01:06:57,929 --> 01:07:02,516
 ... each line of the program creating
a new effect, just like ...

682
01:07:03,561 --> 01:07:05,186
 ... poetry.

683
01:07:05,353 --> 01:07:06,771
First ...

684
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:12,693
 ... a rush, heat. Her heart flutters.

685
01:07:13,278 --> 01:07:15,905
You can see it, Neo, yes?

686
01:07:16,532 --> 01:07:19,117
She does not understand why.

687
01:07:19,367 --> 01:07:21,786
Is it the wine? No.

688
01:07:21,954 --> 01:07:24,329
What is it then? What is the reason?

689
01:07:24,956 --> 01:07:27,291
And soon it does not matter.

690
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:30,461
Soon the why and the reason are gone ...

691
01:07:31,422 --> 01:07:36,967
 ... and all that matters is the feeling itself.

692
01:07:37,427 --> 01:07:40,512
And this is the nature of the universe.

693
01:07:40,681 --> 01:07:43,224
We struggle against it,
we fight to deny it ...

694
01:07:43,391 --> 01:07:45,976
 ... but it is, of course, pretense.
It is a lie.

695
01:07:46,144 --> 01:07:50,148
Beneath our poised appearance ...

696
01:07:50,315 --> 01:07:55,612
 ... the truth is, we are completely ...

697
01:07:58,490 --> 01:08:01,367
 ... out of control.

698
01:08:06,706 --> 01:08:11,585
Causality. There is no escape from it.
We are forever slaves to it.

699
01:08:12,003 --> 01:08:17,466
Our only hope, our only peace,
is to understand it, to understand the why.

700
01:08:17,635 --> 01:08:21,054
"Why" is what separates us from them ...

701
01:08:21,221 --> 01:08:23,515
 ... you from me.

702
01:08:23,681 --> 01:08:27,435
"Why" is the only real source of power.
Without it, you are powerless.

703
01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:30,896
And this is how you come to me,
without why, without power.

704
01:08:31,064 --> 01:08:33,858
Another link in the chain.

705
01:08:34,068 --> 01:08:35,359
But fear not.

706
01:08:35,528 --> 01:08:39,404
Since I have seen how good you are
at following orders ...

707
01:08:39,573 --> 01:08:42,199
 ... I will tell you what to do next.

708
01:08:42,701 --> 01:08:47,538
Run back and give the fortune-teller
this message:

709
01:08:47,747 --> 01:08:52,001
Her time is almost up.

710
01:08:53,045 --> 01:08:56,588
Now I have some real business to do,
so I will say adieu and goodbye.

711
01:08:56,756 --> 01:08:59,259
- This isn't over.
- Oh, yes, it is.

712
01:08:59,426 --> 01:09:05,806
The Keymaker is mine, and I see no reason
why I should give him up.

713
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:10,019
- No reason at all.
- Where are you going?

714
01:09:10,186 --> 01:09:14,899
Please, ma cherie, I have told you.
We are all victims of causality.

715
01:09:15,067 --> 01:09:18,403
I drank too much wine,
I must take a piss.

716
01:09:18,904 --> 01:09:22,030
Cause and effect. Au Revoir.

717
01:09:27,078 --> 01:09:30,164
Touch me and that hand
will never touch anything again.

718
01:09:39,048 --> 01:09:40,550
Well, that didn't go so well.

719
01:09:40,717 --> 01:09:43,094
Are you certain the Oracle
didn't say anything else?

720
01:09:43,261 --> 01:09:45,387
- Yes.
- Maybe we did something wrong.

721
01:09:46,055 --> 01:09:47,390
Or didn't do something.

722
01:09:47,557 --> 01:09:50,810
No, what happen, happened couldn't
happened any other way.

723
01:09:50,978 --> 01:09:53,729
- How do you know?
- We are still alive.

724
01:09:57,025 --> 01:10:00,278
If you want the Keymaker, follow me.

725
01:10:07,286 --> 01:10:09,369
Get out.

726
01:10:11,289 --> 01:10:17,628
I am so sick and tired of his bullshit.
On and on. Pompous prick.

727
01:10:18,213 --> 01:10:23,717
A long time ago, when we first came here,
it was so different.

728
01:10:25,470 --> 01:10:28,180
He was so different.

729
01:10:29,975 --> 01:10:32,601
He was like you.

730
01:10:35,314 --> 01:10:39,108
I'll give you what you want,
but you have to give me something.

731
01:10:39,859 --> 01:10:42,153
- What?
- A kiss.

732
01:10:42,529 --> 01:10:43,654
Excuse me?

733
01:10:45,157 --> 01:10:49,077
I want you to kiss me
as if you were kissing her.

734
01:10:50,996 --> 01:10:54,582
- Why?
- You love her. She loves you.

735
01:10:54,832 --> 01:10:56,792
It's all over you both.

736
01:10:57,461 --> 01:11:02,006
A long time ago,
I knew what that felt like.

737
01:11:03,341 --> 01:11:09,096
I want to remember it.
I want to sample it. That's all.

738
01:11:09,347 --> 01:11:11,181
Just a sample.

739
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:14,351
- Why don't you sample this instead?
- Trinity.

740
01:11:16,563 --> 01:11:21,525
Such emotion over something so small.
It's just a kiss.

741
01:11:21,694 --> 01:11:23,860
Why should we trust you?

742
01:11:24,029 --> 01:11:28,032
If I don't deliver you to the Keymaker,
she can kill me.

743
01:11:35,123 --> 01:11:37,250
All right.

744
01:11:37,542 --> 01:11:41,378
But you have to make me believe
I am her.

745
01:11:42,588 --> 01:11:44,631
All right.

746
01:11:50,972 --> 01:11:52,806
Terrible. Forget it.

747
01:11:55,769 --> 01:11:57,228
Wait.

748
01:11:58,146 --> 01:11:59,689
Okay.

749
01:12:36,769 --> 01:12:38,853
Yes.

750
01:12:39,438 --> 01:12:41,939
That's it.

751
01:12:56,704 --> 01:13:02,126
I envy you. But such a thing
is not meant to last.

752
01:13:05,130 --> 01:13:06,506
Come with me.

753
01:13:37,578 --> 01:13:39,329
Not again.

754
01:13:42,751 --> 01:13:45,377
It's all right, boys. They're with me.

755
01:13:46,046 --> 01:13:48,422
These fellas work for my husband.

756
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:52,426
They do his dirty work.
They're very good, very loyal.

757
01:13:52,594 --> 01:13:54,136
Aren't you, boys?

758
01:13:54,304 --> 01:13:55,345
Yes, mistress.

759
01:13:55,514 --> 01:13:58,224
They come from a much older version
of the Matrix.

760
01:13:58,391 --> 01:14:02,561
But like so many back then, they caused
more problems than they solved.

761
01:14:03,313 --> 01:14:08,317
My husband saved them because
they're notoriously difficult to terminate.

762
01:14:08,484 --> 01:14:12,529
How many people keep silver bullets
in their gun?

763
01:14:17,243 --> 01:14:20,454
You can either run to the restaurant to tell my husband
what I have done ...

764
01:14:20,622 --> 01:14:23,207
 ... or you can stay there and die.

765
01:14:24,126 --> 01:14:26,085
He's in the ladies' room!

766
01:14:32,176 --> 01:14:34,092
Hurry.

767
01:14:59,661 --> 01:15:02,829
- My name is Neo.
- Yes. I'm the Keymaker.

768
01:15:02,997 --> 01:15:04,916
I've been waiting for you.

769
01:15:10,838 --> 01:15:15,426
Oh! My God! My God, Persephone,
how could you do this? You betray me.

770
01:15:19,765 --> 01:15:22,600
- Cause and effect, my love.
- Cause?

771
01:15:22,768 --> 01:15:25,770
There is no cause for this. What cause?

772
01:15:25,938 --> 01:15:30,233
What cause? How about the lipstick
you're still wearing?

773
01:15:30,399 --> 01:15:33,109
Lipstick? Lipstick.

774
01:15:33,278 --> 01:15:37,113
What craziness are you talking about,
woman? There is no lipstick!

775
01:15:38,824 --> 01:15:41,493
She wasn't kissing your face, my love.

776
01:15:42,621 --> 01:15:47,082
Aye-yi-yi-yi.
Woman, this is nothing.

777
01:15:47,251 --> 01:15:52,796
- It is a game. It is only a game.
- So is this.

778
01:15:52,965 --> 01:15:54,966
Have fun.

779
01:16:01,472 --> 01:16:05,059
All right.

780
01:16:05,310 --> 01:16:08,104
Let us find out where this goes.

781
01:16:08,271 --> 01:16:11,148
You two, get the Keymaker.

782
01:16:17,655 --> 01:16:19,657
That's a nice trick.

783
01:16:19,824 --> 01:16:21,117
I cannot go back.

784
01:16:21,659 --> 01:16:23,661
I'll handle them.

785
01:16:24,162 --> 01:16:30,292
Handle us? You'll handle us? You know,
your predecessors had much more respect.

786
01:16:43,681 --> 01:16:45,725
Okay, you have some skill.

787
01:16:47,935 --> 01:16:49,895
Kill him.

788
01:17:50,082 --> 01:17:52,123
You see? He's just a man.

789
01:20:06,926 --> 01:20:09,677
Goddamn it, woman,
you will be the end of me.

790
01:20:11,806 --> 01:20:15,810
Mark my words, boy,
and mark them well.

791
01:20:15,976 --> 01:20:21,189
I have survived your predecessors,
and I will survive you.

792
01:20:41,252 --> 01:20:44,630
- Where are you going?
- Another way. Always another way.

793
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:50,636
Close it, quick!

794
01:20:55,432 --> 01:20:57,976
Could we move along?

795
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:03,106
Run!

796
01:21:19,039 --> 01:21:21,375
Step away from the door.

797
01:21:26,463 --> 01:21:27,756
We owe you for that.

798
01:21:30,010 --> 01:21:31,176
Just like new.

799
01:21:31,469 --> 01:21:32,927
Drop your weapon.

800
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:40,144
- Stay with him.
- What about Neo?

801
01:21:40,311 --> 01:21:41,854
He can handle himself.

802
01:21:44,940 --> 01:21:46,024
Get back.

803
01:22:23,688 --> 01:22:24,854
Shit.

804
01:22:25,356 --> 01:22:26,856
- Operator.
- Link, where am I?

805
01:22:27,399 --> 01:22:30,610
You're not gonna believe this,
but you're all way up in the mountains.

806
01:22:30,904 --> 01:22:33,396
- Really?
- It'll take me a while to get an exit.

807
01:22:33,698 --> 01:22:34,739
- Shit!
- What?

808
01:22:34,949 --> 01:22:37,618
The twins are after Morpheus and Trinity.
I'll have a way to get them out.

809
01:22:37,786 --> 01:22:41,162
- Where are they?
- Middle of the city, 500 miles due south.

810
01:22:57,930 --> 01:22:59,515
- Operator.
- Get us out of here Link.

811
01:22:59,682 --> 01:23:02,434
- That won't be easy sir.
- I know. We're inside the core network.

812
01:23:02,601 --> 01:23:05,229
Yes sir the only exit I got
near you is the Winslow overpass.

813
01:23:05,396 --> 01:23:07,480
- Off the freeway.
- Yes, sir.

814
01:23:07,649 --> 01:23:11,402
- Fine, we'll make it.
- Sir I think I should -- Oh, shit! Look out behind you!

815
01:23:16,408 --> 01:23:17,992
- Incoming fire.
- Down!

816
01:23:26,251 --> 01:23:27,417
Hold on!

817
01:23:44,435 --> 01:23:46,936
Oh, no. This is getting real ugly
real fast.

818
01:23:47,104 --> 01:23:48,814
Are you watching this, Link?

819
01:23:48,981 --> 01:23:52,609
Yes, sir. There's an all points on you.
Eight units headed your way.

820
01:23:53,653 --> 01:23:55,612
Any suggestions?

821
01:23:57,489 --> 01:23:59,490
- Turn right.
- Right, now.

822
01:24:06,957 --> 01:24:09,792
Now straight here.
You'll hit a connecting tunnel to the 101.

823
01:24:09,961 --> 01:24:12,671
- Got it.
- Sir are you sure about this? The freeway, I mean. It's dangerous.

824
01:24:12,838 --> 01:24:16,550
- In 14 years of operating, I've never seen --
- Link, what did I tell you?

825
01:24:16,842 --> 01:24:19,136
Yes, sir. I do, sir. Winslow overpass.

826
01:24:19,304 --> 01:24:21,805
- I'll be ready for you.
- Good man.

827
01:24:21,972 --> 01:24:24,140
You always told me
to stay off the freeway.

828
01:24:24,309 --> 01:24:26,935
- Yes, that's true.
- You said it was suicide.

829
01:24:27,145 --> 01:24:29,063
Then let us hope ...

830
01:24:29,229 --> 01:24:30,605
 ... that I was wrong.

831
01:24:42,493 --> 01:24:43,577
- Operator.
- Link, it's Niobe.

832
01:24:43,744 --> 01:24:45,369
We've been sent to bring you in.

833
01:24:45,537 --> 01:24:48,623
- I need to talk to Morpheus.
- Believe me, Niobe, he needs you.

834
01:24:48,792 --> 01:24:50,792
- Where is he?
- Just follow the sirens.

835
01:24:58,342 --> 01:25:00,260
Repeat, they're approaching the --

836
01:25:03,430 --> 01:25:07,643
- We have them now.
- The exile is the primary target.

837
01:26:10,789 --> 01:26:12,248
Shots fired.

838
01:26:14,877 --> 01:26:16,752
Move!

839
01:28:06,738 --> 01:28:09,949
- We are getting aggravated.
- Yes, we are.

840
01:28:55,997 --> 01:28:57,997
Trinity.

841
01:28:58,416 --> 01:28:59,541
Get him out of here.

842
01:29:03,171 --> 01:29:05,255
Come on!

843
01:29:22,273 --> 01:29:23,774
Crush him.

844
01:29:54,262 --> 01:29:55,305
Morpheus.

845
01:29:55,472 --> 01:29:56,972
He's okay. Keep moving.

846
01:29:57,975 --> 01:29:59,768
Let's go.

847
01:30:05,524 --> 01:30:07,692
I need a download
to hot-wire a motorcycle.

848
01:30:07,859 --> 01:30:10,194
No problem.
One crash course on motorcycle --

849
01:30:10,363 --> 01:30:11,779
Wait.

850
01:30:13,157 --> 01:30:14,615
Cancel that.

851
01:30:14,783 --> 01:30:16,993
You are handy.

852
01:30:17,161 --> 01:30:19,078
Jump on.

853
01:32:46,351 --> 01:32:47,394
She means nothing.

854
01:32:47,561 --> 01:32:50,689
- Find the exile.
- We have them.

855
01:32:51,023 --> 01:32:53,149
One-Adam-12, please respond.

856
01:32:59,614 --> 01:33:01,323
Get down.

857
01:35:12,331 --> 01:35:13,957
Gotcha.

858
01:35:14,708 --> 01:35:15,792
She's good.

859
01:35:20,171 --> 01:35:22,465
You are no longer necessary.

860
01:35:29,140 --> 01:35:32,850
We do only what we're meant to do.

861
01:35:34,478 --> 01:35:38,064
Then you are meant for one more thing:
deletion.

862
01:35:39,024 --> 01:35:40,899
Go kick his ass.

863
01:36:30,951 --> 01:36:33,703
Neo, if you're out there,
I could use some help.

864
01:36:34,454 --> 01:36:35,913
What is that?

865
01:37:05,778 --> 01:37:08,654
Yes! Yes!

866
01:37:15,246 --> 01:37:20,375
Sir we have confirmation from the Icarus. The first
two ships are in position for counterattack.

867
01:37:20,626 --> 01:37:21,667
Good.

868
01:37:22,670 --> 01:37:23,711
Any change?

869
01:37:23,878 --> 01:37:26,631
They slightly hit some iron ore here.
Certain down there.

870
01:37:26,798 --> 01:37:29,926
- How much?
- An hour, maybe.

871
01:37:30,094 --> 01:37:32,636
That would give them
a little over nine hours.

872
01:37:33,471 --> 01:37:35,097
Yes, sir.

873
01:38:07,715 --> 01:38:09,966
There is a building.

874
01:38:10,134 --> 01:38:15,805
Inside this building, there is a level
where no elevator can go ...

875
01:38:15,972 --> 01:38:17,890
 ... and no stair can reach.

876
01:38:18,559 --> 01:38:24,646
This level is filled with doors.
These doors lead to many places.

877
01:38:24,814 --> 01:38:27,149
Hidden places.

878
01:38:27,484 --> 01:38:31,112
But one door is special.

879
01:38:31,279 --> 01:38:33,488
One door leads to the source.

880
01:38:41,832 --> 01:38:46,252
This building is protected
by a very secure system.

881
01:38:46,420 --> 01:38:50,923
- Every alarm triggers the bomb.
- Bomb? Did he say bomb?

882
01:38:51,175 --> 01:38:53,842
But like all systems,
it has a weakness.

883
01:38:54,011 --> 01:38:57,012
The system is based on the rules
of a building.

884
01:38:57,180 --> 01:39:00,557
- One system built on another.
- Electricity.

885
01:39:01,100 --> 01:39:05,854
- If one fails, so must the other.
- No electricity, no alarms.

886
01:39:06,023 --> 01:39:08,858
You'd have to take out a whole city block
to kill the power on a building like that.

887
01:39:09,025 --> 01:39:12,737
- Not one, 27.
- Twenty-seven blocks?

888
01:39:13,572 --> 01:39:16,032
There is a power station.

889
01:39:16,199 --> 01:39:18,451
It must be destroyed.

890
01:39:18,618 --> 01:39:22,956
- There must be some kind of fail-safe.
- Yes, there is an emergency system.

891
01:39:24,582 --> 01:39:28,377
The core network of the grid
must be accessed.

892
01:39:28,545 --> 01:39:31,381
The emergency system
must be deactivated.

893
01:39:31,547 --> 01:39:32,966
What do you need us for?

894
01:39:33,132 --> 01:39:35,301
Neo could take both them out
easier than we could.

895
01:39:35,469 --> 01:39:37,220
- There's no time.
- Why?

896
01:39:37,387 --> 01:39:40,515
Once the door is unprotected,
the connection will be severed.

897
01:39:40,682 --> 01:39:42,975
But another connection
must first be made.

898
01:39:43,810 --> 01:39:47,646
- How long will that take?
- Exactly 314 seconds.

899
01:39:47,814 --> 01:39:49,399
Just over five minutes.

900
01:39:49,565 --> 01:39:51,818
 That is the length
and breadth of the window.

901
01:39:51,985 --> 01:39:54,278
Only the One can open the door ...

902
01:39:54,488 --> 01:39:57,407
 ... and only during that window
can the door be opened.

903
01:39:58,658 --> 01:40:00,243
How do you know all this?

904
01:40:00,411 --> 01:40:05,581
I know because I must know.
It is my purpose.

905
01:40:05,748 --> 01:40:11,253
It's the reason I'm here,
the same reason we're all here.

906
01:40:22,015 --> 01:40:24,809
Neo, I know something's wrong.

907
01:40:25,476 --> 01:40:27,520
You don't have to tell me.

908
01:40:27,688 --> 01:40:31,440
I just want you to know that I'm here.

909
01:40:34,987 --> 01:40:36,445
All must be done as one.

910
01:40:41,201 --> 01:40:42,868
Can't hurt.

911
01:40:46,414 --> 01:40:48,498
If one fails ...

912
01:40:49,292 --> 01:40:51,002
 ... all fail.

913
01:40:51,502 --> 01:40:55,172
At midnight, there is a shift change
in the security of both buildings.

914
01:40:56,550 --> 01:40:59,801
At midnight, we will strike.

915
01:41:00,429 --> 01:41:01,511
Hey!

916
01:41:01,680 --> 01:41:05,640
- You can't sleep at home.
- Why? I get paid to count them here.

917
01:41:15,819 --> 01:41:18,029
Okay, they're inside.

918
01:41:18,197 --> 01:41:20,698
- How much time?
- Twelve minutes.

919
01:41:23,409 --> 01:41:24,493
Oh, shit.

920
01:41:27,872 --> 01:41:33,336
All of our lives, we have fought this war.
Tonight, I believe we can end it.

921
01:41:34,837 --> 01:41:37,006
Tonight is not an accident.

922
01:41:38,341 --> 01:41:40,342
There are no accidents.

923
01:41:41,720 --> 01:41:46,765
We have not come here by chance.
I do not believe in chance.

924
01:41:46,934 --> 01:41:52,521
When I see three objectives,
three captains, three ships ...

925
01:41:52,689 --> 01:41:56,192
 ... I do not see coincidence.
I see providence.

926
01:41:56,527 --> 01:41:58,860
I see purpose.

927
01:42:01,573 --> 01:42:07,912
I believe it is our fate to be here.
It is our destiny.

928
01:42:08,079 --> 01:42:13,083
I believe this night holds
for each and every one of us ...

929
01:42:13,252 --> 01:42:16,587
 ... the very meaning of our lives.

930
01:42:16,755 --> 01:42:20,925
I want to ask you to do something,
but I don't know how.

931
01:42:21,510 --> 01:42:23,426
I promise you, if I can, I will.

932
01:42:24,762 --> 01:42:28,099
What if I asked you to stay out of this ...

933
01:42:29,059 --> 01:42:31,060
 ... no matter what ...

934
01:42:31,228 --> 01:42:33,563
 ... to stay out of the Matrix?

935
01:42:34,648 --> 01:42:36,439
Why?

936
01:42:44,658 --> 01:42:45,740
Please.

937
01:42:47,828 --> 01:42:49,162
All right.

938
01:42:52,498 --> 01:42:55,001
What is it, Niobe?

939
01:42:55,168 --> 01:42:59,296
I can't help it, Morpheus. I can't
help thinking, what if you're wrong?

940
01:42:59,463 --> 01:43:02,757
What if all this, the prophecy,
everything, is bullshit?

941
01:43:02,926 --> 01:43:06,929
Then tomorrow we may all be dead.

942
01:43:07,346 --> 01:43:09,974
But how would that be different
from any other day?

943
01:43:19,443 --> 01:43:25,948
This is a war, and we are soldiers.

944
01:43:26,199 --> 01:43:29,118
Death can come for us at any time ...

945
01:43:29,661 --> 01:43:31,453
 ... in any place.

946
01:43:31,622 --> 01:43:33,538
Incoming. Incoming!

947
01:43:35,500 --> 01:43:37,126
Incoming!

948
01:43:43,050 --> 01:43:45,509
Now consider the alternative.

949
01:43:45,676 --> 01:43:50,264
What if I am right?
What if the prophecy is true?

950
01:43:50,431 --> 01:43:54,851
What if tomorrow the war could be over?

951
01:43:55,811 --> 01:43:58,814
Isn't that worth fighting for?

952
01:43:59,942 --> 01:44:02,568
Isn't that worth dying for?

953
01:44:03,487 --> 01:44:06,113
- Time?
- Three minutes.

954
01:44:06,280 --> 01:44:07,405
Almost there.

955
01:44:27,469 --> 01:44:28,844
It is done.

956
01:44:29,011 --> 01:44:30,304
Find the others.

957
01:44:31,430 --> 01:44:33,682
I got Niobe right there.
They're already out of the station.

958
01:44:33,850 --> 01:44:36,519
- What about Soren?
- There.

959
01:44:36,686 --> 01:44:38,520
They're still inside, but ... .

960
01:44:39,398 --> 01:44:40,439
They're not moving.

961
01:45:04,588 --> 01:45:06,506
That's it, let's go.

962
01:45:08,635 --> 01:45:10,469
Call Neo now.

963
01:45:14,432 --> 01:45:17,268
- I lost them. They're inside the portal.
- What about the grid?

964
01:45:21,398 --> 01:45:24,899
Everything is still operational.
The emergency system is already rerouting power.

965
01:45:30,573 --> 01:45:32,742
Jesus.

966
01:45:32,908 --> 01:45:36,953
Soon as they open that door,
it's all over.

967
01:45:37,122 --> 01:45:39,081
The hell it is.

968
01:45:39,832 --> 01:45:41,167
What are you --? Trinity!

969
01:45:42,461 --> 01:45:45,421
I will not stand here and do nothing.
I will not wait here to watch them die.

970
01:45:45,588 --> 01:45:47,756
We're talking less than five minutes.

971
01:45:47,923 --> 01:45:50,426
In five minutes,
I'll tear that whole damn building down.

972
01:45:50,594 --> 01:45:54,137
- How much further?
- Here, just here.

973
01:45:55,431 --> 01:45:59,435
I'm sorry, this is a dead end.

974
01:46:00,604 --> 01:46:03,104
It's gotta be the ugliest hack
I have ever done.

975
01:46:06,318 --> 01:46:09,444
That's as close as I can get you.
You better grow some wings.

976
01:46:28,047 --> 01:46:29,090
- Operator.
- I'm in.

977
01:46:29,256 --> 01:46:31,425
Keep moving. Sixty-fifth floor.

978
01:46:32,010 --> 01:46:36,180
You look surprised to see me again,
Mr. Anderson.

979
01:46:36,347 --> 01:46:41,726
Well, that's the difference between us.
I have been expecting you.

980
01:46:41,895 --> 01:46:44,814
- What do you want, Smith?
- You haven't figured that out?

981
01:46:44,980 --> 01:46:50,485
Still using all the muscles
except the one that matters.

982
01:46:50,654 --> 01:46:53,322
I want exactly what you want.

983
01:46:53,489 --> 01:46:55,573
I want everything.

984
01:46:56,033 --> 01:46:58,536
Would that include a bullet
from this gun?

985
01:46:58,703 --> 01:47:00,496
Go ahead, shoot.

986
01:47:00,663 --> 01:47:05,960
The best thing about being me,
there's so many me's.

987
01:47:17,346 --> 01:47:20,975
Christ! What the hell happened in here?

988
01:47:21,851 --> 01:47:23,894
Hold it right there, little lady.

989
01:47:33,238 --> 01:47:35,029
If you can't beat us ... .

990
01:47:35,198 --> 01:47:37,032
Join us.

991
01:47:39,202 --> 01:47:40,286
Morpheus!

992
01:47:53,884 --> 01:47:57,011
Still no sight of them.
I don't know what they're doing but they only got two minutes left.

993
01:48:10,774 --> 01:48:11,817
One minute.

994
01:48:21,036 --> 01:48:25,163
Come on.

995
01:48:25,748 --> 01:48:27,625
Please.

996
01:48:37,551 --> 01:48:39,094
Kill them.

997
01:48:46,978 --> 01:48:48,020
They're in.

998
01:48:48,188 --> 01:48:50,146
I don't believe it.

999
01:49:05,704 --> 01:49:07,831
It was meant to be.

1000
01:49:07,998 --> 01:49:13,378
Morpheus, that door will take you home.

1001
01:49:22,137 --> 01:49:26,475
You will know which door.
Hurry, Neo.

1002
01:49:31,981 --> 01:49:35,149
Trinity, I got some serious activity
headed your way.

1003
01:50:27,453 --> 01:50:28,828
Hello, Neo.

1004
01:50:29,372 --> 01:50:33,167
- Who are you?
- I am the Architect.

1005
01:50:33,335 --> 01:50:36,962
I created the Matrix.
I've been waiting for you.

1006
01:50:37,212 --> 01:50:41,382
You have many questions. Though the
process has altered your consciousness ...

1007
01:50:41,551 --> 01:50:43,551
 ... you remain irrevocably human.

1008
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:47,305
Ergo, some of my answers you will
understand and some others you will not.

1009
01:50:47,724 --> 01:50:51,769
Concordantly, while your first question
may be the most pertinent ...

1010
01:50:51,935 --> 01:50:55,648
 ... you may or may not realize
it is also the most irrelevant.

1011
01:50:56,524 --> 01:50:58,149
Why am I here?

1012
01:50:58,318 --> 01:51:02,237
Your life is the sum of a remainder
of an unbalanced equation ...

1013
01:51:02,404 --> 01:51:04,739
 ... inherent to the programming
of the Matrix.

1014
01:51:04,908 --> 01:51:08,993
You are the eventuality of an anomaly,
which despite my sincerest efforts ...

1015
01:51:09,162 --> 01:51:11,997
 ... I've been unable to eliminate
from what is otherwise ...

1016
01:51:12,164 --> 01:51:16,627
 ... a harmony of mathematical precision.

1017
01:51:16,961 --> 01:51:19,296
While it remains a burden
assiduously avoided ...

1018
01:51:19,463 --> 01:51:23,926
 ... it is not unexpected and thus
not beyond a measure of control ...

1019
01:51:24,094 --> 01:51:28,055
 ... which has led you, inexorably ...

1020
01:51:29,015 --> 01:51:30,265
 ... here.

1021
01:51:30,432 --> 01:51:34,520
- You haven't answered my question.
- Quite right.

1022
01:51:34,688 --> 01:51:38,481
Interesting.
That was quicker than the others.

1023
01:51:38,649 --> 01:51:41,275
Others? How many?
What others?

1024
01:51:41,444 --> 01:51:43,945
The Matrix is older than you know.

1025
01:51:44,113 --> 01:51:48,117
I prefer counting from the emergence of one integral
anomaly to the emergence of the next.

1026
01:51:48,283 --> 01:51:50,536
In which case, this is the sixth version.

1027
01:51:50,703 --> 01:51:53,162
Five before me?
He's lying. Bullshit.

1028
01:51:53,331 --> 01:51:56,875
There are only two possible explanations.
There were five before me.

1029
01:51:57,042 --> 01:51:58,335
Either no one told me ...

1030
01:51:59,587 --> 01:52:03,590
 ... or no one knows.
- Precisely.

1031
01:52:03,757 --> 01:52:07,051
As you are undoubtedly gathering,
the anomaly is systemic ...

1032
01:52:07,220 --> 01:52:10,639
 ... creating fluctuations in even
the most simplistic equations.

1033
01:52:10,806 --> 01:52:14,059
You can't control me!
I'm gonna smash you to bits!

1034
01:52:14,226 --> 01:52:16,019
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

1035
01:52:16,186 --> 01:52:19,355
You can't make me do anything.
You old, white prick!

1036
01:52:21,650 --> 01:52:23,152
Choice.

1037
01:52:23,319 --> 01:52:25,154
The problem is choice.

1038
01:52:47,385 --> 01:52:51,012
The first Matrix I designed
was quite naturally perfect, it is a work of art.

1039
01:52:51,180 --> 01:52:53,015
Flawless, sublime.

1040
01:52:53,182 --> 01:52:56,685
A triumph equaled only
by its monumental failure.

1041
01:52:57,353 --> 01:52:59,771
The inevitability of its doom
is apparent now ...

1042
01:52:59,939 --> 01:53:03,274
 ... as a consequence of the imperfection
inherent in every human being.

1043
01:53:03,443 --> 01:53:06,403
Thus, I redesigned it
based on your history ...

1044
01:53:06,570 --> 01:53:10,573
 ... to more accurately reflect
the varying grotesqueries of your nature.

1045
01:53:11,283 --> 01:53:15,037
However, I was again frustrated
by failure.

1046
01:53:16,497 --> 01:53:19,123
I have since come to understand
that the answer eluded me ...

1047
01:53:19,292 --> 01:53:21,335
 ... because it required a lesser mind.

1048
01:53:21,502 --> 01:53:27,466
Or perhaps, a mind less bound
by the parameters of perfection.

1049
01:53:27,884 --> 01:53:32,304
Thus, the answer was stumbled upon
by another, an intuitive program ...

1050
01:53:32,471 --> 01:53:37,266
 ... initially created to investigate
certain aspects of the human psyche.

1051
01:53:37,435 --> 01:53:43,398
If I am the father of the Matrix,
she would undoubtedly be its mother.

1052
01:53:44,024 --> 01:53:46,318
- The Oracle.
- Please.

1053
01:53:47,028 --> 01:53:51,030
As I was saying, she stumbled upon a
solution whereby 99 percent of subjects ...

1054
01:53:51,198 --> 01:53:54,076
 ... accepted the program, as long as they
were given a choice ...

1055
01:53:54,243 --> 01:53:58,372
 ... even if they were only aware
of the choice at a near unconscious level.

1056
01:53:58,539 --> 01:54:01,958
While this answer functioned,
it was obviously fundamentally flawed ...

1057
01:54:02,126 --> 01:54:06,128
 ... thus creating the otherwise
contradictory systemic anomaly ...

1058
01:54:06,296 --> 01:54:09,006
 ... that, if left unchecked,
might threaten the system itself.

1059
01:54:09,384 --> 01:54:13,511
Ergo, those that refused the program,
while a minority, if unchecked ...

1060
01:54:13,680 --> 01:54:17,765
 ... would constitute
an escalating probability of disaster.

1061
01:54:17,934 --> 01:54:19,725
This is about Zion.

1062
01:54:20,185 --> 01:54:23,855
You are here because Zion
is about to be destroyed.

1063
01:54:24,023 --> 01:54:28,443
Its every living inhabitant terminated,
its entire existence eradicated.

1064
01:54:28,735 --> 01:54:29,778
Bullshit.

1065
01:54:29,945 --> 01:54:33,114
Denial is the most predictable
of all human responses.

1066
01:54:33,323 --> 01:54:39,787
But rest assured, this will be
the sixth time we have destroyed it ...

1067
01:54:39,956 --> 01:54:43,958
 ... and we have become
exceedingly efficient at it.

1068
01:54:56,680 --> 01:54:57,972
The function of the One ...

1069
01:54:58,140 --> 01:55:02,810
 ... is now to return to the source, allowing
a temporary dissemination of the code you carry ...

1070
01:55:02,979 --> 01:55:04,688
 ... reinserting the prime program.

1071
01:55:05,273 --> 01:55:09,275
After which you will be required to select
from the Matrix 23 individuals ...

1072
01:55:09,444 --> 01:55:12,695
 ... sixteen female, seven male,
to rebuild Zion.

1073
01:55:12,863 --> 01:55:17,408
Failure to comply with this process
will result in a cataclysmic system crash ...

1074
01:55:17,577 --> 01:55:19,912
 ... killing everyone connected
to the Matrix ...

1075
01:55:20,078 --> 01:55:22,663
 ... which, coupled with the
extermination of Zion ...

1076
01:55:22,832 --> 01:55:27,043
 ... will ultimately result in the extinction
of the entire human race.

1077
01:55:27,377 --> 01:55:31,465
You won't let it happen. You can't.
You need human beings to survive.

1078
01:55:32,257 --> 01:55:35,886
There are levels of survival
we are prepared to accept.

1079
01:55:36,054 --> 01:55:38,846
However the relevant issue is
whether or not you are ready ...

1080
01:55:39,015 --> 01:55:42,600
 ... to accept the responsibility for the death
of every human being in this world.

1081
01:55:49,067 --> 01:55:51,609
It is interesting reading your reactions.

1082
01:55:52,654 --> 01:55:56,489
Your five predecessors were, by design,
based on a similar predication ...

1083
01:55:56,658 --> 01:56:01,118
 ... a contingent affirmation that was meant
to create a profound attachment ...

1084
01:56:01,287 --> 01:56:04,872
 ... to the rest of your species,
facilitating the function of the One.

1085
01:56:05,041 --> 01:56:07,376
While the others experience this
in a very general way ...

1086
01:56:07,542 --> 01:56:10,503
 ... your experience is far more specific ...

1087
01:56:10,837 --> 01:56:13,715
 ... vis-a-vis love.

1088
01:56:14,716 --> 01:56:16,342
Trinity!

1089
01:56:18,637 --> 01:56:22,975
Apropos, she entered the Matrix
to save your life at the cost of her own.

1090
01:56:23,350 --> 01:56:24,393
No.

1091
01:56:25,103 --> 01:56:29,230
Which brings us at last to the moment
of truth, wherein the fundamental flaw ...

1092
01:56:29,399 --> 01:56:32,484
 ... is ultimately expressed
and the anomaly revealed ...

1093
01:56:32,652 --> 01:56:36,654
 ... as both beginning and end.

1094
01:56:36,823 --> 01:56:38,489
There are two doors.

1095
01:56:38,658 --> 01:56:41,868
The door to your right leads to the source
and the salvation of Zion.

1096
01:56:42,453 --> 01:56:48,750
The door to your left leads back to the
Matrix, to her and to the end of your species.

1097
01:56:48,917 --> 01:56:53,296
As you adequately put,
the problem is choice.

1098
01:56:53,463 --> 01:56:56,966
But we already know what
you are going to do, don't we?

1099
01:56:57,135 --> 01:57:01,220
Already I can see the chain reaction,
the chemical precursors that signal ...

1100
01:57:01,389 --> 01:57:06,643
 ... the onset of an emotion designed
specifically to overwhelm logic and reason.

1101
01:57:06,810 --> 01:57:11,439
An emotion that is already blinding you
from the simple and obvious truth:

1102
01:57:11,606 --> 01:57:18,113
She is going to die and there is nothing
you can do to stop it.

1103
01:57:23,118 --> 01:57:27,247
Hope. It is the quintessential
human delusion, simultaneously ...

1104
01:57:27,414 --> 01:57:31,126
 ... the source of your greatest strength
and your greatest weakness.

1105
01:57:31,293 --> 01:57:35,630
If I were you, I would hope
that we don't meet again.

1106
01:57:35,797 --> 01:57:37,215
We won't.

1107
01:57:44,640 --> 01:57:46,850
We got a serious situation, sir.

1108
01:57:47,310 --> 01:57:48,393
Oh, no.

1109
01:58:48,037 --> 01:58:51,581
- What was that?
- Whatever it is. It's moving faster than anything I've ever seen.

1110
01:59:42,216 --> 01:59:44,009
Holy shit, he caught her.

1111
01:59:57,939 --> 01:59:59,774
Neo, I had to.

1112
01:59:59,942 --> 02:00:01,693
I know.

1113
02:00:06,740 --> 02:00:09,283
The bullet is still inside.

1114
02:00:20,046 --> 02:00:21,962
Trinity ...

1115
02:00:23,173 --> 02:00:24,882
 ... don't you quit on me now.

1116
02:00:34,060 --> 02:00:36,645
I'm sorry.

1117
02:00:43,152 --> 02:00:45,444
Trinity.

1118
02:00:55,413 --> 02:00:57,373
Trinity ...

1119
02:00:57,541 --> 02:00:59,333
 ... I know you can hear me.

1120
02:01:00,127 --> 02:01:02,671
I'm not letting go.

1121
02:01:02,837 --> 02:01:04,463
I can't.

1122
02:01:05,675 --> 02:01:07,884
I love you too damn much.

1123
02:01:36,579 --> 02:01:37,872
I can't take this.

1124
02:01:41,627 --> 02:01:44,712
I guess this makes us even.

1125
02:01:57,393 --> 02:01:59,351
I don't understand it.

1126
02:01:59,520 --> 02:02:02,521
Everything was done
as it was supposed to be done.

1127
02:02:02,689 --> 02:02:05,734
Once the One reaches the source,
the war should be over.

1128
02:02:05,900 --> 02:02:08,737
- In 24 hours, it will be.
- What?

1129
02:02:08,904 --> 02:02:13,240
If we don't do something in 24 hours,
Zion will be destroyed.

1130
02:02:13,658 --> 02:02:15,284
- What?
- How do you know that?

1131
02:02:15,744 --> 02:02:17,787
- I was told it would happen.
- By whom?

1132
02:02:18,788 --> 02:02:21,623
It doesn't matter. I believed him.

1133
02:02:21,792 --> 02:02:25,627
- That's impossible. The prophecy tells us --
- It was a lie, Morpheus.

1134
02:02:27,381 --> 02:02:29,923
The prophecy was a lie.

1135
02:02:31,135 --> 02:02:34,136
The One was never meant
to end anything.

1136
02:02:34,305 --> 02:02:37,349
It was all another system of control.

1137
02:02:37,515 --> 02:02:40,601
I don't believe that.

1138
02:02:40,935 --> 02:02:43,270
But you said it yourself.

1139
02:02:43,439 --> 02:02:47,442
How can the prophecy be true
if the war isn't over?

1140
02:02:53,615 --> 02:02:56,076
I'm sorry.

1141
02:02:56,243 --> 02:02:59,621
I know it isn't easy to hear, but ...

1142
02:02:59,788 --> 02:03:02,957
 ... I swear to you it's the truth.

1143
02:03:06,170 --> 02:03:08,880
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

1144
02:03:11,091 --> 02:03:12,300
Oh, no!

1145
02:03:21,644 --> 02:03:24,979
- What are they doing?
- They're just out of EMP range.

1146
02:03:25,480 --> 02:03:26,730
It's a bomb.

1147
02:03:27,899 --> 02:03:30,109
We have to get out of here. Now.

1148
02:04:06,814 --> 02:04:08,689
I have dreamed a dream ...

1149
02:04:11,734 --> 02:04:15,113
 ... but now that dream
has gone from me.

1150
02:04:26,167 --> 02:04:28,417
Here they come.

1151
02:04:28,668 --> 02:04:30,377
Let's go, Morpheus.

1152
02:04:31,796 --> 02:04:34,841
- We won't make it.
- We have to try.

1153
02:04:42,557 --> 02:04:45,560
- Come on!
- Something's different.

1154
02:04:45,728 --> 02:04:47,729
What?

1155
02:04:48,396 --> 02:04:49,898
I can feel them.

1156
02:05:12,837 --> 02:05:14,421
Neo!

1157
02:05:20,595 --> 02:05:24,181
- What happened?
- I don't know.

1158
02:05:29,438 --> 02:05:31,355
It's the Hammer.

1159
02:05:43,034 --> 02:05:45,744
He's in some kind of coma ...

1160
02:05:45,912 --> 02:05:48,163
 ... but his vitals are stable.

1161
02:05:49,375 --> 02:05:51,292
What about you?

1162
02:05:51,460 --> 02:05:53,586
I'm fine.

1163
02:05:53,753 --> 02:05:56,130
You could use some rest.

1164
02:05:56,297 --> 02:05:58,131
No, I'm gonna stay with him.

1165
02:06:05,224 --> 02:06:07,850
Lock was right.
He guessed that the machines ...

1166
02:06:08,018 --> 02:06:10,895
 ... would cut off the mainlines
in and out of Zion.

1167
02:06:11,063 --> 02:06:13,814
He thought a counterattack
might surprise them.

1168
02:06:14,065 --> 02:06:17,484
It sounded good.
I figured we had a shot ...

1169
02:06:17,819 --> 02:06:20,363
 ... until someone screwed it up.

1170
02:06:20,530 --> 02:06:23,157
An EMP was triggered before
we got in position.

1171
02:06:23,324 --> 02:06:25,201
Five ships were instantly downed.

1172
02:06:25,368 --> 02:06:27,161
When the machines broke through ...

1173
02:06:27,328 --> 02:06:30,539
 ... it wasn't a battle, it was a slaughter.

1174
02:06:30,707 --> 02:06:33,542
Was it an accident?
Some sort of malfunction?

1175
02:06:33,711 --> 02:06:36,170
- No one knows.
- Someone does.

1176
02:06:36,337 --> 02:06:38,088
Who?

1177
02:06:38,256 --> 02:06:41,967
Once the machines were done with us,
they started digging again.

1178
02:06:42,136 --> 02:06:44,429
We made a quick pass
to look for survivors.

1179
02:06:44,637 --> 02:06:45,721
You found one?

1180
02:06:47,474 --> 02:06:49,182
Only one.

1181
02:16:42,277 --> 02:16:45,570
Everything that has a beginning ...

1182
02:16:45,738 --> 02:16:47,448
 ... has an end.

1183
02:16:49,868 --> 02:16:52,745
I see the end coming.

1184
02:16:52,913 --> 02:16:56,707
I see the darkness spreading.
I see death.

1185
02:16:58,834 --> 02:17:01,836
Mr. Anderson, welcome back.

1186
02:17:02,004 --> 02:17:04,005
We missed you.

1187
02:17:04,174 --> 02:17:06,007
It ends tonight.

1188
02:17:13,225 --> 02:17:16,352
You are all that stands in his way.

1189
02:17:17,938 --> 02:17:22,483
If you cannot stop him tonight,
then I fear that tomorrow may never come.
