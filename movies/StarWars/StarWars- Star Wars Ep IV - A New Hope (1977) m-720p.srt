1
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,329
Did you hear that?

2
00:02:48,457 --> 00:02:51,206
They shut down the main reactor.
We'll be destroyed for sure.

3
00:02:51,332 --> 00:02:52,825
This is madness.

4
00:03:02,917 --> 00:03:04,325
We're doomed.

5
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,954
There'll be no escape
for the princess this time.

6
00:03:12,332 --> 00:03:13,741
What's that?

7
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,452
R2-D2, where are you?

8
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:17,447
At last.
Where have you been?

9
00:05:17,582 --> 00:05:20,663
They're heading in this direction.
What are we going to do?

10
00:05:20,792 --> 00:05:24,240
We'll be sent to the Kessel spice mines
or smashed into who knows what.

11
00:05:25,417 --> 00:05:27,372
Wait a minute.
Where are you going?

12
00:05:40,042 --> 00:05:42,992
The Death Star plans
are not in the main computer.

13
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,740
Where are those transmissions
you intercepted?

14
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:48,658
What have you done
with those plans?

15
00:05:48,792 --> 00:05:50,747
We intercepted no transmissions.

16
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:55,696
This is a consular ship.
We're on a diplomatic mission.

17
00:05:55,832 --> 00:06:00,372
If this is a consular ship,
where is the ambassador?

18
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:07,370
Commander, tear this ship apart
until you've found those plans!

19
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,367
And bring me the passengers!
I want them alive!

20
00:06:22,917 --> 00:06:24,410
There's one.
Set for stun.

21
00:06:30,167 --> 00:06:31,790
She'll be all right.

22
00:06:31,917 --> 00:06:33,788
Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.

23
00:06:35,417 --> 00:06:37,870
Hey. You're not permitted in there.
It's restricted.

24
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,906
You'll be deactivated for sure.

25
00:06:41,917 --> 00:06:44,487
Don't call me a mindless philosopher,
you overweight glob of grease.

26
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:46,247
Come out,
before somebody sees you.

27
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:50,822
Secret mission? What plans?

28
00:06:50,957 --> 00:06:53,492
What are you talking about?
I'm not getting in there.

29
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:59,120
I'm going to regret this.

30
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:09,574
- There goes another one.
- Hold your fire. There's no life forms.

31
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:10,987
It must have short-circuited.

32
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:14,406
That's funny. The damage
doesn't look as bad from out here.

33
00:07:16,792 --> 00:07:18,747
Are you sure this thing is safe?

34
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:40,161
Darth Vader.
Only you could be so bold.

35
00:07:40,292 --> 00:07:42,661
The Imperial Senate will not
sit still for this.

36
00:07:42,792 --> 00:07:46,038
- You've attacked a diplomatic...
- Don't act so surprised, Your Highness.

37
00:07:46,167 --> 00:07:48,038
You weren't on
any mercy mission this time.

38
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:52,242
Several transmissions
were beamed to this ship by rebel spies.

39
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:55,206
I want to know what happened
to the plans they sent you.

40
00:07:55,332 --> 00:07:57,324
I don't know what
you're talking about.

41
00:07:57,457 --> 00:08:00,408
I'm a member of the Imperial Senate
on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan.

42
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:03,374
You are part of the Rebel Alliance
and a traitor.

43
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,406
Take her away!

44
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:12,197
Holding her is dangerous.
If word gets out...

45
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,867
it could generate sympathy
for the rebellion in the senate.

46
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,322
I have traced the rebel spies to her.

47
00:08:17,457 --> 00:08:20,125
Now she is my only link
to finding their secret base.

48
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,122
She'll die before
she'll tell you anything.

49
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,872
Leave that to me.

50
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,447
Send a distress signal, and then inform
the senate that all aboard were killed.

51
00:08:27,582 --> 00:08:30,663
Lord Vader, the battle station plans
are not aboard this ship...

52
00:08:30,792 --> 00:08:32,201
and no transmissions were made.

53
00:08:32,332 --> 00:08:36,491
An escape pod was jettisoned during the
fighting, but no life forms were aboard.

54
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:39,576
She must have hidden
the plans in the escape pod.

55
00:08:39,707 --> 00:08:43,239
Send a detachment down to retrieve them.
See to it personally, Commander.

56
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:45,413
There'll be no one
to stop us this time.

57
00:08:45,542 --> 00:08:47,034
Yes, sir.

58
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,663
How did we get into this mess?

59
00:09:03,792 --> 00:09:06,115
I really don't know how.

60
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:10,075
We seem to be made to suffer.
It's our lot in life.

61
00:09:12,707 --> 00:09:16,287
I've got to rest before I fall apart.
My joints are almost frozen.

62
00:09:23,332 --> 00:09:25,323
What a desolate place this is.

63
00:09:29,667 --> 00:09:31,621
Where do you think you're going?

64
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:35,328
Well, I'm not going that way.
It's much too rocky.

65
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:37,913
This way is much easier.

66
00:09:38,042 --> 00:09:40,412
What makes you think
there are settlements over there?

67
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:43,865
Don't get technical with me.

68
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,240
What mission?
What are you talking about?

69
00:09:49,167 --> 00:09:51,655
I've just about had enough of you.

70
00:09:52,417 --> 00:09:53,696
Go that way.

71
00:09:53,832 --> 00:09:56,748
You'll be malfunctioning within a day,
you nearsighted scrap pile.

72
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,034
And don't let me catch you
following me, begging for help...

73
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:02,288
because you won't get it.

74
00:10:15,457 --> 00:10:17,115
No more adventures.

75
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,205
I'm not going that way.

76
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:56,039
That malfunctioning little twerp.
This is all his fault.

77
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:59,280
He tricked me
into going this way...

78
00:10:59,417 --> 00:11:01,288
but he'll do no better.

79
00:11:04,582 --> 00:11:06,657
Wait. What's that?

80
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:09,494
A transport. I'm saved.

81
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,331
Over here!

82
00:11:11,457 --> 00:11:12,535
Hey!

83
00:11:12,667 --> 00:11:14,041
Hey!

84
00:11:14,167 --> 00:11:17,580
Help! Please help!

85
00:14:47,917 --> 00:14:48,830
R2?

86
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:56,655
R2-D2, it is you! It is you!

87
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:33,413
Someone was in the pod.
The tracks go off in this direction.

88
00:15:34,457 --> 00:15:36,365
Look, sir. Droids.

89
00:15:50,792 --> 00:15:52,332
We stopped.

90
00:15:52,457 --> 00:15:54,163
Wake up. Wake up!

91
00:16:01,167 --> 00:16:02,743
We're doomed.

92
00:16:10,957 --> 00:16:13,078
Do you think
they'll melt us down?

93
00:16:25,832 --> 00:16:27,907
Don't shoot.
Don't shoot.

94
00:16:28,042 --> 00:16:30,245
Will this never end?

95
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:12,367
- Fine. Let's go.
- Luke!

96
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,957
Luke!

97
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:22,452
Luke, tell Uncle if he gets
a translator, be sure it speaks Bocce.

98
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,036
Doesn't look like we have
much choice, but I'll remind him.

99
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:38,364
Yeah, we'll take that red one.

100
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,406
No, not that one.

101
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:45,157
I suppose you're programmed
for etiquette and protocol.

102
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:49,238
Protocol? It's my primary function, sir.
I am well-versed in all the customs...

103
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:52,656
- I have no need for a protocol droid.
- Of course you haven't, sir.

104
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:55,493
Not in an environment such as this.
That's why I have been programmed...

105
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:59,618
I need a droid who understands the
binary language of moisture vaporators.

106
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,997
<i>Vaporators? Sir, my first job
was programming binary load lifters...</i>

107
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:03,875
very similar to your vaporators
in most respects.

108
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,249
Very similar to your vaporators
in most respects.

109
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:08,871
- Can you speak Bocce?
- Of course. It's like a second language.

110
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,666
- All right. Shut up. I'll take this one.
- Shutting up, sir.

111
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:17,334
Take these two to the garage.
I want them cleaned up before dinner.

112
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:20,373
But I was going into Tosche Station
to pick up some power converters.

113
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,498
You can waste time with your friends
when your chores are done.

114
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,579
Now come on.
Get to it.

115
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:27,827
All right. Come on.

116
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:32,739
And the red one.
Come on.

117
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:36,280
Come on, red. Let's go.

118
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:57,246
- Uncle Owen.
- Yeah?

119
00:18:57,375 --> 00:19:00,076
This R2 unit has
a bad motivator. Look.

120
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,577
Hey, what are you
trying to push on us?

121
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:10,530
Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit
is in prime condition, a real bargain.

122
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:12,538
Uncle Owen,
what about that one?

123
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:15,238
What about that blue one?
We'll take that one.

124
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:19,374
- Take this away.
- You'll be pleased with that one, sir.

125
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,372
He really is in first-class condition.

126
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,454
I've worked with him before.
Here he comes.

127
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,164
Let's go.

128
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:30,914
Don't you forget this.

129
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:34,490
Why I should stick my neck out for you
is quite beyond my capacity.

130
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:44,241
Thank the maker.
This oil bath is going to feel so good.

131
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:49,323
I've got such a bad case of dust
contamination I can barely move.

132
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,413
It just isn't fair.

133
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:53,912
Biggs is right.
I'm never gonna get out of here.

134
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:56,497
Is there anything
I might do to help?

135
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:59,788
No, not unless you can alter time,
speed up the harvest...

136
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:01,539
or teleport me off this rock.

137
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:03,208
I don't think so, sir.

138
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:06,912
I'm only a droid and not very
knowledgeable about such things.

139
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:08,320
Not on this planet, anyway.

140
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:11,824
As a matter of fact,
I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.

141
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:14,280
Well, if there's a bright centre
to the universe...

142
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:16,372
you're on the planet
that it's farthest from.

143
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,406
I see, sir.

144
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:21,494
- You can call me Luke.
- I see, Sir Luke.

145
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:24,366
Just Luke.

146
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:28,200
And I am C-3PO,
human-cyborg relations.

147
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,951
This is my counterpart, R2-D2.

148
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:32,539
Hello.

149
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:37,204
A lot of carbon scoring here.
Looks like you've seen a lot of action.

150
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:40,828
With all we've been through, I'm amazed
we're in as good condition as we are...

151
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:42,580
with the rebellion and all.

152
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,615
You know of the rebellion
against the Empire?

153
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:48,115
That's how we came to be in your
service, if you take my meaning, sir.

154
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,536
- Have you been in many battles?
- Several, I think.

155
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,538
There's not much to tell.

156
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:56,198
I'm not much more than an interpreter
and not very good at telling stories.

157
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:58,822
Well, not at making them
interesting, anyway.

158
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:01,454
Well, my little friend...

159
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:03,868
you got something jammed
in here real good.

160
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,954
Were you on a Starcruiser or...

161
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:09,115
<i>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.</i>

162
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,826
What's this?

163
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:14,038
"What is what''?
He asked you a question. What is that?

164
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:18,076
<i>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.</i>

165
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:25,405
<i>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.</i>

166
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:30,414
He says it's nothing, sir,
merely a malfunction.

167
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:32,332
Old data. Pay it no mind.

168
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,496
Who is she?
She's beautiful.

169
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:37,954
I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.

170
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:40,203
I think she was a passenger
on our last voyage.

171
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:42,288
A person of some importance,
I believe.

172
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:44,787
- Our captain was...
- Is there any more to this recording?

173
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:50,115
Behave yourself, R2.
You're going to get us into trouble.

174
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,999
It's all right. You can trust him.
He's our new master.

175
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:54,748
<i>You're my only hope.</i>

176
00:21:55,791 --> 00:22:00,744
He says he's the property of Obi-Wan
Kenobi, a resident of these parts...

177
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:02,616
and it's a private message for him.

178
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,740
Frankly, I don't know
what he's talking about.

179
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:06,829
Our last master
was Captain Antilles.

180
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:11,579
But with all we've been through,
this R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.

181
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:14,825
Obi-Wan Kenobi.
I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi.

182
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:17,576
I beg your pardon, sir, but do you
know what he's talking about?

183
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:20,113
I don't know anyone
named Obi-Wan...

184
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:23,078
but old Ben lives
out beyond the Dune Sea.

185
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:24,950
He's kind of a strange old hermit.

186
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:28,079
I wonder who she is.

187
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:31,703
Sounds like she's in trouble.
I better play back the whole thing.

188
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:38,115
He says the restraining bolt has
short-circuited his recording system.

189
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:41,034
He suggests that
if you remove the bolt...

190
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:43,868
he might be able to play back
the entire recording.

191
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,074
Oh, yeah. Well...

192
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:49,655
I guess you're too small
to run away on me if I take this off.

193
00:22:49,791 --> 00:22:50,952
Okay.

194
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:55,451
There you go.

195
00:22:57,041 --> 00:23:00,123
Where'd she go? Bring her back.
Play back the entire message.

196
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:02,455
"What message''?

197
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:04,490
The one you've just been playing.

198
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:06,663
The one you're carrying
inside your rusty innards.

199
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:08,498
Luke! Luke!

200
00:23:08,625 --> 00:23:11,114
I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.

201
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:14,034
I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have
picked up a slight flutter.

202
00:23:14,166 --> 00:23:17,532
Here. See what you can do with him.
I'll be right back.

203
00:23:20,291 --> 00:23:23,076
Just you reconsider
playing that message for him.

204
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,573
No, I don't think
he likes you at all.

205
00:23:26,708 --> 00:23:29,030
No, I don't like you either.

206
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:41,613
- That R2 unit might have been stolen.
- What makes you think that?

207
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:44,664
I stumbled across a recording
while I was cleaning him.

208
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:47,197
He says he belongs to someone
called Obi-Wan Kenobi.

209
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:53,121
I thought he might have meant old Ben.
Do you know what he's talking about?

210
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:57,405
I wonder if he's related to Ben.

211
00:23:57,625 --> 00:23:59,282
That wizard's just a crazy old man.

212
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:04,405
Tomorrow, take that R2 unit to
Anchorhead and have its memory erased.

213
00:24:04,541 --> 00:24:06,449
That'll be the end of it.
It belongs to us now.

214
00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:10,826
But what if this Obi-Wan
comes looking for him?

215
00:24:10,958 --> 00:24:11,988
He won't.

216
00:24:13,416 --> 00:24:16,996
I don't think he exists any more. He died
about the same time as your father.

217
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:20,157
- He knew my father?
- I told you to forget it.

218
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:24,326
Your only concern is to prepare
those new droids for tomorrow.

219
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:28,372
In the morning, I want them on the
south ridge working on those condensers.

220
00:24:29,083 --> 00:24:30,539
Yes, sir.

221
00:24:31,708 --> 00:24:34,375
I think those new droids
are gonna work out fine.

222
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,829
In fact, I was also thinking
about our agreement...

223
00:24:37,958 --> 00:24:40,114
about me staying on
another season.

224
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:45,372
If these new droids work out, I want
to apply to the academy this year.

225
00:24:46,375 --> 00:24:48,247
You mean the next semester
before the harvest?

226
00:24:48,375 --> 00:24:50,164
Sure. There's more
than enough droids.

227
00:24:50,291 --> 00:24:52,282
Harvest is when I need you the most.

228
00:24:52,416 --> 00:24:54,407
It's only one season more.

229
00:24:54,541 --> 00:24:57,659
This year we'll make enough
on the harvest to hire more hands...

230
00:24:57,791 --> 00:25:00,077
and then you can go
to the academy next year.

231
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,990
You must understand
I need you here, Luke.

232
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:05,992
- But it's a whole 'nother year.
- It's only one more season.

233
00:25:06,125 --> 00:25:08,163
That's what you said
when Biggs and Tank left.

234
00:25:08,291 --> 00:25:10,744
- Where are you going?
- Looks like I'm going nowhere.

235
00:25:10,875 --> 00:25:12,616
I have to go finish
cleaning those droids.

236
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:16,079
Owen, he can't stay here forever.
Most of his friends have gone.

237
00:25:16,208 --> 00:25:18,199
It means so much to him.

238
00:25:18,916 --> 00:25:21,287
I'll make it up to him next year.
I promise.

239
00:25:23,041 --> 00:25:26,905
Luke's just not a farmer, Owen.
He has too much of his father in him.

240
00:25:27,041 --> 00:25:29,412
That's what I'm afraid of.

241
00:26:18,375 --> 00:26:21,491
- What are you doing hiding back there?
- It wasn't my fault, sir.

242
00:26:21,625 --> 00:26:23,366
Please don't deactivate me.

243
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,118
I told him not to go,
but he's faulty, malfunctioning.

244
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:29,413
- Kept babbling on about his mission.
- Oh, no.

245
00:26:37,958 --> 00:26:40,280
That R2 unit
has always been a problem.

246
00:26:40,416 --> 00:26:42,988
These astrodroids
are getting quite out of hand.

247
00:26:43,125 --> 00:26:45,328
Even I can't understand
their logic at times.

248
00:26:45,458 --> 00:26:47,911
How could I be so stupid?
He's nowhere in sight.

249
00:26:48,625 --> 00:26:51,872
- Blast it.
- Couldn't we go after him?

250
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,163
It's too dangerous with the Sandpeople
around. We'll have to wait till morning.

251
00:26:55,291 --> 00:26:57,247
Luke, I'm shutting
the power down.

252
00:26:57,375 --> 00:26:59,281
I'll be there in a few minutes.

253
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,906
Boy, am I gonna get it.

254
00:27:02,625 --> 00:27:06,570
- That droid's gonna cause me trouble.
- He excels at that, sir.

255
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,207
Come on.

256
00:27:29,291 --> 00:27:31,163
Have you seen Luke this morning?

257
00:27:31,291 --> 00:27:34,657
He said he had things to do before
he started today, so he left early.

258
00:27:34,791 --> 00:27:37,825
- Did he take those new droids with him?
- I think so.

259
00:27:38,541 --> 00:27:41,326
He better have those units in
the south range repaired by midday...

260
00:27:41,458 --> 00:27:43,080
or there'll be hell to pay.

261
00:27:44,125 --> 00:27:46,660
There's a droid on the scanner.
Dead ahead.

262
00:27:46,791 --> 00:27:49,742
It might be our little R2 unit.
Hit the accelerator.

263
00:28:12,208 --> 00:28:14,199
Where do you think you're going?

264
00:28:15,166 --> 00:28:17,038
Master Luke is your
rightful owner now.

265
00:28:17,166 --> 00:28:20,117
We'll have no more
of this Obi-Wan Kenobi gibberish.

266
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:22,955
Don't talk to me of your mission.

267
00:28:23,083 --> 00:28:26,200
You're fortunate he doesn't blast you
into a million pieces right here.

268
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:28,738
No. It's all right,
but I think we'd better go.

269
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:31,699
What's wrong with him now?

270
00:28:31,833 --> 00:28:34,616
There are several creatures
approaching from the southeast.

271
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,740
Sandpeople. Or worse.

272
00:28:38,166 --> 00:28:40,157
Come on.
Let's go have a look.

273
00:28:40,291 --> 00:28:41,749
Come on.

274
00:28:45,291 --> 00:28:47,863
There are two Banthas down there,
but I don't see any...

275
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,741
Wait a second.

276
00:28:49,875 --> 00:28:52,659
They're Sandpeople all right.
I can see one of them now.

277
00:30:07,291 --> 00:30:08,452
Hello there.

278
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:14,122
Come here, my little friend.
Don't be afraid.

279
00:30:16,875 --> 00:30:18,532
Don't worry.
He'll be all right.

280
00:30:24,791 --> 00:30:27,280
Rest easy, son.
You've had a busy day.

281
00:30:28,166 --> 00:30:31,082
You're fortunate
to be all in one piece.

282
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:36,530
Ben? Ben Kenobi?

283
00:30:36,666 --> 00:30:38,622
Boy, am I glad to see you.

284
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:41,748
The Jundland Wastes
are not to be travelled lightly.

285
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,448
Tell me, young Luke,
what brings you out this far?

286
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:50,790
This little droid.

287
00:30:52,875 --> 00:30:54,415
He's searching
for his former master...

288
00:30:54,541 --> 00:30:56,615
but I've never seen
such devotion in a droid.

289
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:01,782
He claims to be the property
of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.

290
00:31:01,916 --> 00:31:04,867
Is he a relative of yours?
Do you know who he's talking about?

291
00:31:06,083 --> 00:31:07,659
Obi-Wan Kenobi?

292
00:31:10,125 --> 00:31:11,582
Obi-Wan.

293
00:31:12,541 --> 00:31:16,488
Now, that's a name
I've not heard in a long time.

294
00:31:17,291 --> 00:31:19,034
A long time.

295
00:31:20,291 --> 00:31:23,160
I think my uncle knows him.
He said he was dead.

296
00:31:23,291 --> 00:31:24,950
He's not dead.

297
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:26,243
Not yet.

298
00:31:26,375 --> 00:31:29,326
- You know him?
- Of course I know him.

299
00:31:29,458 --> 00:31:30,785
He's me.

300
00:31:33,541 --> 00:31:36,741
I haven't gone
by the name of Obi-Wan...

301
00:31:36,875 --> 00:31:39,493
since, oh, before you were born.

302
00:31:39,625 --> 00:31:41,201
Then the droid does belong to you.

303
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:43,951
I don't seem to remember
ever owning a droid.

304
00:31:45,833 --> 00:31:47,289
<i>Very interesting.</i>

305
00:31:49,375 --> 00:31:51,247
I think we better get indoors.

306
00:31:51,958 --> 00:31:54,625
The Sandpeople are easily startled...

307
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:57,499
but they'll soon be back...
and in greater numbers.

308
00:32:00,625 --> 00:32:01,702
3PO.

309
00:32:11,166 --> 00:32:13,786
Where am I?
I must have taken a bad step.

310
00:32:15,291 --> 00:32:18,491
Can you stand? We've gotta get out
of here before the Sandpeople return.

311
00:32:18,625 --> 00:32:21,326
I don't think I can make it.
You go on, Master Luke.

312
00:32:21,458 --> 00:32:25,451
There's no sense in you risking
yourself on my account. I'm done for.

313
00:32:26,541 --> 00:32:28,413
No, you're not.
What kind of talk is that?

314
00:32:28,541 --> 00:32:30,413
Quickly. They're on the move.

315
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:39,079
My father didn't fight in the wars.
He was a navigator on a spice freighter.

316
00:32:39,208 --> 00:32:42,904
That's what your uncle told you. He
didn't hold with your father's ideals.

317
00:32:43,041 --> 00:32:46,123
Thought he should have stayed here
and not gotten involved.

318
00:32:46,875 --> 00:32:49,161
- You fought in the Clone Wars?
- Yes.

319
00:32:49,291 --> 00:32:52,906
I was once a Jedi knight,
the same as your father.

320
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,205
I wish I'd known him.

321
00:32:57,333 --> 00:33:00,035
He was the best
starpilot in the galaxy...

322
00:33:00,958 --> 00:33:02,829
and a cunning warrior.

323
00:33:02,958 --> 00:33:05,446
I understand you've become
quite a good pilot yourself.

324
00:33:07,708 --> 00:33:10,077
And he was a good friend.

325
00:33:10,208 --> 00:33:11,616
Which reminds me...

326
00:33:12,875 --> 00:33:14,829
I have something here for you.

327
00:33:16,875 --> 00:33:19,445
Your father wanted you to have this
when you were old enough...

328
00:33:19,583 --> 00:33:22,201
but your uncle wouldn't allow it.

329
00:33:23,125 --> 00:33:25,199
He feared you might
follow old Obi-Wan...

330
00:33:25,333 --> 00:33:28,746
on some damn-fool idealistic crusade,
like your father did.

331
00:33:28,875 --> 00:33:31,789
Sir, if you'll not be needing me,
I'll close down for a while.

332
00:33:31,916 --> 00:33:33,458
Go ahead.

333
00:33:36,166 --> 00:33:39,532
- What is it?
- It's your father's lightsabre.

334
00:33:40,416 --> 00:33:42,905
This is the weapon of a Jedi knight.

335
00:33:43,041 --> 00:33:45,826
Not as clumsy or random
as a blaster.

336
00:33:46,875 --> 00:33:49,078
An elegant weapon...

337
00:33:49,208 --> 00:33:52,159
for a more civilized age.

338
00:33:54,083 --> 00:33:56,121
For over a thousand generations...

339
00:33:56,250 --> 00:34:00,457
the Jedi knights were the guardians of
peace and justice in the old Republic...

340
00:34:00,583 --> 00:34:03,285
before the dark times...

341
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:05,075
before the Empire.

342
00:34:08,125 --> 00:34:09,996
How did my father die?

343
00:34:12,541 --> 00:34:15,030
Ayoung Jedi named Darth Vader...

344
00:34:15,166 --> 00:34:17,655
who was a pupil of mine
until he turned to evil...

345
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:21,782
helped the Empire hunt down
and destroy the Jedi knights.

346
00:34:23,625 --> 00:34:25,994
He betrayed and murdered your father.

347
00:34:27,791 --> 00:34:30,032
Now the Jedi are all but extinct.

348
00:34:31,333 --> 00:34:35,030
<i>Vader was seduced
by the dark side of the Force.</i>

349
00:34:35,166 --> 00:34:36,659
The Force?

350
00:34:38,041 --> 00:34:40,447
The Force is
what gives a Jedi his power.

351
00:34:41,166 --> 00:34:44,331
It's an energy field
created by all living things.

352
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:46,661
It surrounds us and penetrates us.

353
00:34:46,791 --> 00:34:48,449
It binds the galaxy together.

354
00:34:55,541 --> 00:34:58,077
Let's see if we can't figure out
what you are, little friend...

355
00:34:59,375 --> 00:35:01,413
and where you come from.

356
00:35:01,541 --> 00:35:04,659
- I saw part of a message...
- I seem to have found it.

357
00:35:04,791 --> 00:35:09,081
<i>General Kenobi, years ago you served
my father in the Clone Wars.</i>

358
00:35:09,208 --> 00:35:12,621
<i>Now he begs you to help him
in his struggle against the Empire.</i>

359
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:15,831
<i>I regret that I am unable to present
my father's request in person.</i>

360
00:35:15,958 --> 00:35:17,864
<i>But my ship
has fallen under attack...</i>

361
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,155
<i>and my mission
to bring you to Alderaan has failed.</i>

362
00:35:20,291 --> 00:35:23,539
<i>I have placed information vital
to the survival of the rebellion...</i>

363
00:35:23,666 --> 00:35:25,704
<i>into the memory systems
of this R2 unit.</i>

364
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:27,623
<i>My father will know
how to retrieve it.</i>

365
00:35:28,458 --> 00:35:31,574
<i>You must see this droid
safely delivered to him on Alderaan.</i>

366
00:35:32,458 --> 00:35:34,827
<i>This is our most desperate hour.</i>

367
00:35:34,958 --> 00:35:37,990
<i>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.</i>

368
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,041
You must learn the ways of the Force
if you're to come with me to Alderaan.

369
00:35:57,166 --> 00:35:58,576
Alderaan?

370
00:35:58,708 --> 00:36:00,614
I'm not going to Alderaan.

371
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:02,954
I've gotta get home.
I'm in for it as it is.

372
00:36:03,083 --> 00:36:05,487
I need your help, Luke.
She needs your help.

373
00:36:05,625 --> 00:36:08,706
I'm getting too old
for this sort of thing.

374
00:36:13,375 --> 00:36:16,657
I can't get involved.
I've got work to do.

375
00:36:17,541 --> 00:36:19,331
It's not that I like the Empire.
I hate it.

376
00:36:19,458 --> 00:36:22,077
But there's nothing
I can do about it right now.

377
00:36:23,541 --> 00:36:26,989
- It's all such a long way from here.
- That's your uncle talking.

378
00:36:27,125 --> 00:36:30,952
Oh, boy. My uncle.
How am I ever gonna explain this?

379
00:36:31,083 --> 00:36:33,487
Learn about the Force, Luke.

380
00:36:39,958 --> 00:36:42,114
I can take you
as far as Anchorhead.

381
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:46,163
You can get a transport there
to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.

382
00:36:47,458 --> 00:36:50,409
You must do what you feel
is right, of course.

383
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,579
Until this battle station is fully
operational, we are vulnerable.

384
00:37:01,708 --> 00:37:03,829
The Rebel Alliance
is too well equipped.

385
00:37:03,958 --> 00:37:05,829
They're more dangerous
than you realize.

386
00:37:05,958 --> 00:37:08,826
Dangerous to your starfleet,
Commander...

387
00:37:08,958 --> 00:37:10,615
not to this battle station.

388
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:14,329
The rebellion will continue to
gain support in the Imperial Senate...

389
00:37:14,458 --> 00:37:18,119
The Imperial Senate will no longer
be of any concern to us.

390
00:37:18,916 --> 00:37:22,992
I've just received word that the emperor
has dissolved the council permanently.

391
00:37:23,125 --> 00:37:26,739
The last remnants of the old Republic
have been swept away.

392
00:37:27,458 --> 00:37:28,831
That's impossible.

393
00:37:28,958 --> 00:37:31,197
How will the emperor maintain control
without the bureaucracy?

394
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:35,824
The regional governors now have
direct control over their territories.

395
00:37:36,583 --> 00:37:40,197
Fear will keep
the local systems in line.

396
00:37:40,333 --> 00:37:43,663
- Fear of this battle station.
- And what of the rebellion?

397
00:37:43,791 --> 00:37:46,992
If the rebels have obtained a complete
technical readout of this station...

398
00:37:47,125 --> 00:37:49,032
it is possible,
however unlikely...

399
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:51,240
that they might find a weakness
and exploit it.

400
00:37:52,041 --> 00:37:55,572
The plans you refer to will
soon be back in our hands.

401
00:37:55,708 --> 00:37:59,951
Any attack by the rebels against this
station would be a useless gesture...

402
00:38:00,083 --> 00:38:02,038
no matter what technical data
they've obtained.

403
00:38:02,166 --> 00:38:05,746
This station is now
the ultimate power in the universe.

404
00:38:06,541 --> 00:38:08,164
I suggest we use it.

405
00:38:08,291 --> 00:38:12,498
Don't be too proud of this
technological terror you've constructed.

406
00:38:12,625 --> 00:38:15,990
The ability to destroy a planet
is insignificant...

407
00:38:16,125 --> 00:38:17,914
next to the power of the Force.

408
00:38:18,041 --> 00:38:21,454
Don't try to frighten us with
your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader.

409
00:38:21,583 --> 00:38:24,202
Your sad devotion
to that ancient religion...

410
00:38:24,333 --> 00:38:27,081
has not helped you conjure up
the stolen data tapes...

411
00:38:27,208 --> 00:38:31,248
or given you clairvoyance enough
to find the rebels' hidden fortress...

412
00:38:38,125 --> 00:38:40,199
I find your lack of faith disturbing.

413
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:44,916
<i>Enough of this.
Vader, release him.</i>

414
00:38:45,041 --> 00:38:46,451
As you wish.

415
00:38:48,708 --> 00:38:50,746
This bickering is pointless.

416
00:38:51,958 --> 00:38:55,619
Lord Vader will provide us with
the location of the rebel fortress...

417
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,788
by the time this station
is operational.

418
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:01,617
We will then crush the rebellion
with one swift stroke.

419
00:39:09,625 --> 00:39:12,824
It looks like the Sandpeople did this.
There's gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks.

420
00:39:12,958 --> 00:39:15,577
I've just never heard of them
hitting anything this big before.

421
00:39:15,708 --> 00:39:18,989
They didn't, but we are
meant to think they did.

422
00:39:19,125 --> 00:39:20,996
These tracks are side-by-side.

423
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:25,248
Sandpeople always ride single file
to hide their numbers.

424
00:39:25,375 --> 00:39:28,206
These are the same Jawas
that sold us R2 and 3PO.

425
00:39:28,333 --> 00:39:32,492
And these blast points,
too accurate for Sandpeople.

426
00:39:33,208 --> 00:39:37,072
Only imperial stormtroopers
are so precise.

427
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,661
But why would imperial troops
want to slaughter Jawas?

428
00:39:45,166 --> 00:39:48,117
If they traced the robots here, they may
have learned who they sold them to...

429
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:50,204
and that would lead
them back... home.

430
00:39:50,333 --> 00:39:51,577
Wait, Luke.

431
00:39:51,708 --> 00:39:53,663
It's too dangerous.

432
00:40:17,791 --> 00:40:19,119
Uncle Owen.

433
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,577
Aunt Beru.

434
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:16,117
Now, Your Highness,
we will discuss the location...

435
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:18,784
of your hidden rebel base.

436
00:42:01,625 --> 00:42:04,077
There's nothing you could have done,
had you been there.

437
00:42:04,958 --> 00:42:06,829
You'd have been killed too...

438
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:09,625
and the droids would now be
in the hands of the Empire.

439
00:42:11,458 --> 00:42:13,413
I want to come with you to Alderaan.

440
00:42:14,208 --> 00:42:16,163
There's nothing for me here now.

441
00:42:16,291 --> 00:42:19,242
I want to learn the ways of the Force
and become a Jedi like my father.

442
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,286
Mos Eisley spaceport.

443
00:42:37,416 --> 00:42:42,157
You will never find a more wretched hive
of scum and villainy.

444
00:42:43,125 --> 00:42:45,079
We must be cautious.

445
00:43:25,958 --> 00:43:27,829
How long have you
had these droids?

446
00:43:27,958 --> 00:43:31,074
- Three or four seasons.
- They're up for sale if you want them.

447
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:33,032
Let me see your identification.

448
00:43:33,166 --> 00:43:36,449
You don't need to see
his identification.

449
00:43:36,583 --> 00:43:38,905
We don't need to see
his identification.

450
00:43:39,041 --> 00:43:41,530
These aren't the droids
you're looking for.

451
00:43:41,666 --> 00:43:43,574
These aren't the droids
we're looking for.

452
00:43:44,791 --> 00:43:47,114
He can go about his business.

453
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:50,449
- You can go about your business.
- Move along.

454
00:43:50,583 --> 00:43:51,780
Move along.

455
00:44:09,458 --> 00:44:12,574
I can't abide those Jawas.
Disgusting creatures.

456
00:44:13,625 --> 00:44:15,532
Go on, go on.

457
00:44:16,916 --> 00:44:20,117
I can't understand how we got by
those troops. I thought we were dead.

458
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:24,539
The Force can have a strong influence
on the weak-minded.

459
00:44:27,833 --> 00:44:30,865
You really think we're gonna find
a pilot here to take us to Alderaan?

460
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,914
Most of the best freighter pilots
are to be found here.

461
00:44:34,041 --> 00:44:37,822
Only watch your step...
this place can be a little rough.

462
00:44:37,958 --> 00:44:40,079
I'm ready for anything.

463
00:44:43,583 --> 00:44:45,454
Come along, R2.

464
00:45:35,458 --> 00:45:38,905
- Hey. We don't serve their kind here.
- What?

465
00:45:39,041 --> 00:45:41,956
Your droids... they'll have to wait
outside. We don't want them here.

466
00:45:42,083 --> 00:45:44,487
Wait out by the speeder.
We don't want any trouble.

467
00:45:44,625 --> 00:45:46,579
I heartily agree with you, sir.

468
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:58,204
I'll have one of those.

469
00:46:32,916 --> 00:46:35,583
- He doesn't like you.
- I'm sorry.

470
00:46:37,625 --> 00:46:41,121
I don't like you either.
You just watch yourself.

471
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:45,789
We're wanted men.
I have the death sentence on 12 systems.

472
00:46:45,916 --> 00:46:48,701
- I'll be careful then.
- You'll be dead.

473
00:46:48,833 --> 00:46:50,739
This little one's
not worth the effort.

474
00:46:51,958 --> 00:46:53,913
Come, let me get you something.

475
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:22,704
I'm all right.

476
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:28,083
Chewbacca here is first mate
on a ship that might suit us.

477
00:47:33,041 --> 00:47:35,032
I don't like the look of this.

478
00:47:49,875 --> 00:47:53,405
<i>Han Solo. I'm captain
of the Millennium Falcon.</i>

479
00:47:53,541 --> 00:47:56,706
Chewie here tells me you're looking
for passage to the Alderaan system.

480
00:47:56,833 --> 00:47:59,119
Yes, indeed,
if it's a fast ship.

481
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:02,994
<i>Fast ship? You've never heard of
the Millennium Falcon?</i>

482
00:48:03,125 --> 00:48:04,701
Should I have?

483
00:48:04,833 --> 00:48:07,949
It's the ship that made the Kessel run
in less than 12 parsecs.

484
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,239
I've outrun imperial starships.

485
00:48:12,375 --> 00:48:14,329
Not the local bulk cruisers,
mind you.

486
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:16,579
I'm talking about
the big Corellian ships now.

487
00:48:18,416 --> 00:48:20,407
She's fast enough for you,
old man.

488
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:24,367
- What's the cargo?
- Only passengers...

489
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:27,284
myself, the boy, two droids...

490
00:48:28,458 --> 00:48:30,329
and no questions asked.

491
00:48:31,625 --> 00:48:33,449
Is it some kind of local trouble?

492
00:48:33,583 --> 00:48:38,702
Let's just say we'd like to avoid
any imperial entanglements.

493
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:42,909
Well, that's the real trick, isn't it?

494
00:48:43,041 --> 00:48:44,949
And it's gonna cost you
something extra.

495
00:48:46,791 --> 00:48:48,498
10,000, all in advance.

496
00:48:50,291 --> 00:48:51,536
10,000?

497
00:48:52,875 --> 00:48:55,409
We could almost
buy our own ship for that.

498
00:48:55,541 --> 00:48:57,746
But who's gonna fly it, kid? You?

499
00:48:57,875 --> 00:48:59,913
You bet I could.
I'm not such a bad pilot.

500
00:49:00,041 --> 00:49:02,411
We don't have
to sit here and listen...

501
00:49:02,541 --> 00:49:05,373
We can pay you 2,000 now...

502
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:08,746
plus 15 when we reach Alderaan.

503
00:49:09,541 --> 00:49:10,655
Seventeen?

504
00:49:14,416 --> 00:49:16,657
Okay, you guys
got yourselves a ship.

505
00:49:16,791 --> 00:49:19,244
We'll leave as soon as you're ready.
Docking Bay 94.

506
00:49:19,375 --> 00:49:20,489
Ninety-four.

507
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:25,572
Looks like somebody's beginning
to take an interest in your handiwork.

508
00:49:27,125 --> 00:49:29,199
All right. We'll check it out.

509
00:49:41,125 --> 00:49:44,538
17,000. Those guys
must really be desperate.

510
00:49:44,666 --> 00:49:48,079
This could really save my neck.
Get back to the ship, get it ready.

511
00:49:49,208 --> 00:49:51,199
- You'll have to sell your speeder.
- That's okay.

512
00:49:51,333 --> 00:49:53,324
I'm never coming back
to this planet again.

513
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:56,911
Going somewhere, Solo?

514
00:49:57,041 --> 00:50:00,074
Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact,
I was just going to see your boss.

515
00:50:00,208 --> 00:50:02,329
Tell Jabba that
I've got his money.

516
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:04,329
It's too late.

517
00:50:04,458 --> 00:50:06,827
You should have paid him
when you had the chance.

518
00:50:06,958 --> 00:50:10,371
Jabba's put a price on your head
so large...

519
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:13,414
every bounty hunter in the galaxy
will be looking for you.

520
00:50:13,541 --> 00:50:15,496
I'm lucky I found you first.

521
00:50:15,625 --> 00:50:17,780
Yeah, but this time
I've got the money.

522
00:50:17,916 --> 00:50:21,447
If you give it to me,
I might forget I found you.

523
00:50:21,583 --> 00:50:24,864
I don't have it with me.
Tell Jabba...

524
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,452
Jabba's through with you.

525
00:50:27,583 --> 00:50:30,072
He has no time for smugglers...

526
00:50:30,208 --> 00:50:32,827
who drop their shipments at
the first sign of an imperial cruiser.

527
00:50:32,958 --> 00:50:36,655
Even I get boarded sometimes.
Do you think I had a choice?

528
00:50:36,791 --> 00:50:40,867
You can tell that to Jabba.
He may only take your ship.

529
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,155
Over my dead body.

530
00:50:43,291 --> 00:50:44,405
That's the idea.

531
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:48,487
I've been looking forward to this
for a long time.

532
00:50:48,625 --> 00:50:49,903
I'll bet you have.

533
00:51:04,458 --> 00:51:06,579
Sorry about the mess.

534
00:51:15,458 --> 00:51:18,456
Her resistance to the mind probe
is considerable.

535
00:51:18,583 --> 00:51:21,996
It'll be some time before we can
extract any information from her.

536
00:51:22,125 --> 00:51:25,655
The final checkout is completed.
All systems are operational.

537
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:27,947
What course shall we set?

538
00:51:28,083 --> 00:51:31,449
Perhaps she would respond
to an alternative form of persuasion.

539
00:51:31,583 --> 00:51:33,159
What do you mean?

540
00:51:33,291 --> 00:51:36,206
I think it is time we demonstrated
the full power of this station.

541
00:51:36,333 --> 00:51:38,786
- Set your course for Alderaan.
- With pleasure.

542
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,990
Lock the door, R2.

543
00:51:44,125 --> 00:51:46,079
Check this side of the street.

544
00:51:50,291 --> 00:51:52,827
The door's locked.
Move on to the next one.

545
00:51:59,458 --> 00:52:02,409
I would much rather have gone with
Master Luke than stay here with you.

546
00:52:03,208 --> 00:52:06,621
I don't know what this trouble is about,
but I'm sure it must be your fault.

547
00:52:07,458 --> 00:52:08,951
Watch your language.

548
00:52:11,041 --> 00:52:13,530
All right. Give it to me.
I'll take it.

549
00:52:14,416 --> 00:52:17,947
Look at this. Ever since the XP-38
came out, they just aren't in demand.

550
00:52:18,083 --> 00:52:19,824
It'll be enough.

551
00:52:38,458 --> 00:52:41,490
Solo! Come out of there, Solo!

552
00:52:42,833 --> 00:52:44,788
Right here, Jabba.

553
00:52:46,041 --> 00:52:47,534
I've been waitin' for you.

554
00:52:47,666 --> 00:52:49,574
Have you now.

555
00:52:51,458 --> 00:52:53,579
You didn't think I was
gonna run, did you?

556
00:52:54,291 --> 00:52:58,699
Han, my boy, you disappoint me.

557
00:52:58,833 --> 00:53:00,871
Why haven't you paid me...

558
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,365
and why did you fry poor Greedo?

559
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:08,742
Jabba, next time you wanna talk to me,
come yourself. Don't send these twerps.

560
00:53:08,875 --> 00:53:12,371
Han, I can't make exceptions.

561
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:15,331
What if everyone
who smuggled for me...

562
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:17,992
dropped their cargo
at the first sign...

563
00:53:18,125 --> 00:53:20,744
of an imperial starship?

564
00:53:20,875 --> 00:53:22,746
It's not good business.

565
00:53:22,875 --> 00:53:26,240
Look, Jabba,
even I get boarded sometimes.

566
00:53:27,541 --> 00:53:29,947
You think I had a choice?

567
00:53:30,083 --> 00:53:31,824
But I got a nice, easy charter.

568
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:35,998
I'll pay ya back, plus a little extra.
I just need a little more time.

569
00:53:36,125 --> 00:53:41,659
Han, my boy, you're the best.

570
00:53:41,791 --> 00:53:44,114
So, for an extra 20%...

571
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:46,204
Fifteen, Jabba.
Don't push it.

572
00:53:46,333 --> 00:53:48,371
Okay, 15%.

573
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:50,621
But if you fail me again...

574
00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:53,664
I'll put a price on your head so big...

575
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:57,951
you won't be able to go near
a civilized system.

576
00:53:58,083 --> 00:54:00,831
Jabba, you're a wonderful
human being.

577
00:54:02,333 --> 00:54:03,447
Come on!

578
00:54:09,458 --> 00:54:13,072
If the ship's as fast as he's boasting,
we ought to do well.

579
00:54:36,791 --> 00:54:38,664
What a piece of junk.

580
00:54:38,791 --> 00:54:41,280
She'll make.5 past light speed.

581
00:54:41,416 --> 00:54:44,166
She may not look like much,
but she's got it where it counts, kid.

582
00:54:44,291 --> 00:54:47,242
I've made a lot of special
modifications myself.

583
00:54:47,375 --> 00:54:51,239
But we're a little rushed, so if you'll
just get on board, we'll get outta here.

584
00:54:55,875 --> 00:54:57,331
Hello, sir.

585
00:55:06,458 --> 00:55:07,914
Which way?

586
00:55:09,541 --> 00:55:11,496
All right, men,
load your weapons.

587
00:55:13,125 --> 00:55:15,659
Stop that ship.
Blast them.

588
00:55:25,541 --> 00:55:27,496
Chewie, get us out of here!

589
00:55:28,958 --> 00:55:32,454
Oh, my. I'd forgotten
how much I hate space travel.

590
00:55:51,416 --> 00:55:54,331
Looks like an imperial cruiser. Our
passengers are hotter than I thought.

591
00:55:54,458 --> 00:55:56,164
Hold 'em off.
Angle the deflector shields...

592
00:55:56,291 --> 00:55:58,117
while I make the calculations
for the jump to light speed.

593
00:56:08,958 --> 00:56:11,826
Stay sharp. There's two more comin'.
They're gonna try and cut us off.

594
00:56:11,958 --> 00:56:13,949
Why don't you outrun 'em?
I thought this thing was fast.

595
00:56:14,083 --> 00:56:15,907
Watch your mouth, or you're
gonna find yourself floating home.

596
00:56:16,041 --> 00:56:19,407
We'll be safe enough
once we make the jump to hyperspace.

597
00:56:19,541 --> 00:56:21,367
Besides, I know a few manoeuvres.
We'll lose 'em.

598
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:27,490
Here's where the fun begins.

599
00:56:27,625 --> 00:56:29,367
How long before you can
jump to light speed?

600
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:32,367
It'll take a few moments to get
the coordinates from the navicomputer.

601
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:34,041
At the rate they're gaining?

602
00:56:34,166 --> 00:56:37,164
Travelling through hyperspace
ain't like dustin' crops, boy.

603
00:56:37,291 --> 00:56:38,489
Without precise calculations...

604
00:56:38,625 --> 00:56:40,947
we'd fly right through a star
or bounce too close to a supernova...

605
00:56:41,083 --> 00:56:43,405
and that would end your trip
real quick.

606
00:56:43,541 --> 00:56:45,864
- What's that flashing?
- We're losing a deflector shield.

607
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,914
Go strap yourselves in.
I'm gonna make the jump to light speed.

608
00:57:09,916 --> 00:57:12,202
We've entered
the Alderaan system.

609
00:57:13,250 --> 00:57:17,159
Governor Tarkin. I should have expected
to find you holding Vader's leash.

610
00:57:17,291 --> 00:57:20,907
I recognized your foul stench
when I was brought on board.

611
00:57:22,583 --> 00:57:24,454
Charming to the last.

612
00:57:25,166 --> 00:57:27,039
You don't know
how hard I found it...

613
00:57:27,166 --> 00:57:29,039
signing the order
to terminate your life.

614
00:57:29,166 --> 00:57:31,998
I'm surprised you had the courage
to take the responsibility yourself.

615
00:57:32,125 --> 00:57:35,242
Princess Leia,
before your execution...

616
00:57:35,375 --> 00:57:37,530
I would like you to be my guest
at a ceremony...

617
00:57:37,666 --> 00:57:40,664
that will make
this battle station operational.

618
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:43,576
No star system will dare
oppose the emperor now.

619
00:57:44,291 --> 00:57:46,365
The more you
tighten your grip, Tarkin...

620
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:49,119
the more star systems
will slip through your fingers.

621
00:57:49,250 --> 00:57:51,952
Not after we demonstrate
the power of this station.

622
00:57:52,666 --> 00:57:56,079
In a way, you have determined
the choice of the planet...

623
00:57:56,208 --> 00:57:58,329
that'll be destroyed first.

624
00:57:58,458 --> 00:58:02,914
Since you are reluctant to provide us
with the location of the rebel base...

625
00:58:03,041 --> 00:58:05,826
I have chosen to test
this station's destructive power...

626
00:58:05,958 --> 00:58:07,913
on your home planet of Alderaan.

627
00:58:08,916 --> 00:58:11,619
No. Alderaan is peaceful.
We have no weapons.

628
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:14,036
You would prefer another target?
A military target?

629
00:58:14,166 --> 00:58:16,322
Then name the system.

630
00:58:18,291 --> 00:58:21,621
I grow tired of asking this,
so it will be the last time.

631
00:58:22,541 --> 00:58:24,367
Where is the rebel base?

632
00:58:27,958 --> 00:58:29,534
Dantooine.

633
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:31,992
They're on Dantooine.

634
00:58:32,125 --> 00:58:35,490
There. You see, Lord Vader?
She can be reasonable.

635
00:58:35,625 --> 00:58:38,409
Continue with the operation.
You may fire when ready.

636
00:58:38,541 --> 00:58:40,663
- What?
- You're far too trusting.

637
00:58:40,791 --> 00:58:43,197
Dantooine is too remote
to make an effective demonstration.

638
00:58:43,333 --> 00:58:47,871
But don't worry. We will deal with
your rebel friends soon enough.

639
00:58:50,333 --> 00:58:52,407
Commence primary ignition.

640
00:59:15,791 --> 00:59:17,913
Are you all right?
What's wrong?

641
00:59:19,333 --> 00:59:21,489
I felt a great disturbance
in the Force...

642
00:59:21,625 --> 00:59:24,742
as if millions of voices suddenly
cried out in terror...

643
00:59:24,875 --> 00:59:26,782
and were suddenly silenced.

644
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:29,490
I fear something terrible
has happened.

645
00:59:31,291 --> 00:59:33,496
You'd better get on
with your exercises.

646
00:59:36,083 --> 00:59:38,452
You can forget your troubles
with those imperial slugs.

647
00:59:38,583 --> 00:59:40,538
I told you I'd outrun them.

648
00:59:44,541 --> 00:59:46,579
Don't everybody
thank me at once.

649
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:50,074
Anyway, we should be at Alderaan
about 0200 hours.

650
00:59:58,666 --> 01:00:00,621
Now be careful, R2.

651
01:00:10,041 --> 01:00:12,577
He made a fair move.
Screaming about it can't help you.

652
01:00:12,708 --> 01:00:14,829
Let him have it.
It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.

653
01:00:14,958 --> 01:00:17,280
But, sir, nobody worries
about upsetting a droid.

654
01:00:17,416 --> 01:00:21,956
'Cause a droid don't pull people's arms
out of their sockets when they lose.

655
01:00:22,083 --> 01:00:24,239
Wookiees are known to do that.

656
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,824
I see your point, sir.

657
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:31,536
I suggest a new strategy, R2.
Let the Wookiee win.

658
01:00:50,041 --> 01:00:53,621
Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force
flowing through him.

659
01:00:54,416 --> 01:00:56,702
- You mean it controls your actions?
- Partially.

660
01:00:56,833 --> 01:00:58,704
But it also obeys your commands.

661
01:01:03,958 --> 01:01:08,117
Hokey religions and ancient weapons
are no match for a blaster at your side.

662
01:01:08,875 --> 01:01:11,280
You don't believe
in the Force, do you?

663
01:01:11,416 --> 01:01:13,786
Kid, I've flown from one side
of this galaxy to the other.

664
01:01:13,916 --> 01:01:15,789
I've seen a lot of strange stuff...

665
01:01:15,916 --> 01:01:18,157
but I've never seen anything
to make me believe...

666
01:01:18,291 --> 01:01:21,574
there's one all-powerful force
controlling everything.

667
01:01:21,708 --> 01:01:25,784
There's no mystical energy field
controls my destiny.

668
01:01:25,916 --> 01:01:28,748
It's all a lot of
simple tricks and nonsense.

669
01:01:28,875 --> 01:01:31,742
I suggest you try it again, Luke.

670
01:01:33,125 --> 01:01:36,076
This time, let go your conscious self...

671
01:01:37,958 --> 01:01:40,114
and act on instinct.

672
01:01:41,250 --> 01:01:44,663
With the blast shield down, I can't see.
How am I supposed to fight?

673
01:01:44,791 --> 01:01:47,161
Your eyes can deceive you.
Don't trust them.

674
01:01:56,625 --> 01:01:58,911
Stretch out with your feelings.

675
01:02:13,375 --> 01:02:15,496
You see? You can do it.

676
01:02:15,625 --> 01:02:17,248
I call it luck.

677
01:02:17,375 --> 01:02:19,945
In my experience,
there's no such thing as luck.

678
01:02:20,083 --> 01:02:22,322
Good against remotes is one thing.

679
01:02:22,458 --> 01:02:25,409
Good against the living,
that's something else.

680
01:02:26,541 --> 01:02:28,449
We're coming up on Alderaan.

681
01:02:31,875 --> 01:02:34,541
I did feel something.
I could almost see the remote.

682
01:02:34,666 --> 01:02:39,039
That's good. You've taken
your first step into a larger world.

683
01:02:44,291 --> 01:02:45,833
Yes?

684
01:02:45,958 --> 01:02:47,864
Our scout ships
have reached Dantooine.

685
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,871
They found the remains
of a rebel base...

686
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,322
but they estimate that
it has been deserted for some time.

687
01:02:52,458 --> 01:02:55,788
They are now conducting an extensive
search of the surrounding systems.

688
01:02:56,833 --> 01:02:59,367
She lied.
She lied to us.

689
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:03,161
I told you she would never
consciously betray the rebellion.

690
01:03:04,541 --> 01:03:06,496
Terminate her immediately.

691
01:03:09,666 --> 01:03:12,286
Stand by, Chewie.
Cut in the sublight engines.

692
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:16,119
What the...

693
01:03:19,291 --> 01:03:22,952
We've come out in a meteor shower,
some kind of asteroid collision.

694
01:03:23,083 --> 01:03:25,369
- It's not on any of the charts.
- What's going on?

695
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:27,786
Our position's correct,
except no Alderaan.

696
01:03:27,916 --> 01:03:30,121
- Where is it?
- That's what I'm trying to tell you.

697
01:03:30,250 --> 01:03:32,039
It ain't there.
It's been blown away.

698
01:03:32,166 --> 01:03:34,833
- What? How?
- Destroyed by the Empire.

699
01:03:34,958 --> 01:03:37,161
The entire starfleet
couldn't destroy the whole planet.

700
01:03:37,291 --> 01:03:39,780
It'd take a thousand ships
with more firepower than I've...

701
01:03:41,375 --> 01:03:43,579
- There's another ship coming in.
- Maybe they know what happened.

702
01:03:43,708 --> 01:03:44,952
It's an imperial fighter.

703
01:03:47,041 --> 01:03:49,612
- It followed us.
- No. It's a short-range fighter.

704
01:03:49,750 --> 01:03:51,871
There aren't any bases here.
Where did it come from?

705
01:03:55,166 --> 01:03:57,869
Sure is leaving in a hurry.
If they identify us, we're in trouble.

706
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,074
Not if I can help it.
Chewie, jam its transmissions.

707
01:04:00,208 --> 01:04:03,538
- Let it go. It's too far out of range.
- Not for long.

708
01:04:07,416 --> 01:04:10,617
A fighter that size couldn't get
this deep into space on its own.

709
01:04:10,750 --> 01:04:13,369
He must have gotten lost,
been part of a convoy or something.

710
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:16,331
He ain't gonna be around
long enough to tell anybody about us.

711
01:04:18,875 --> 01:04:20,746
He's heading for that small moon.

712
01:04:20,875 --> 01:04:23,364
I can get him before he gets there.
He's almost in range.

713
01:04:24,958 --> 01:04:27,032
That's no moon.

714
01:04:27,166 --> 01:04:30,449
- It's a space station.
- It's too big to be a space station.

715
01:04:33,833 --> 01:04:36,237
I have a very bad
feeling about this.

716
01:04:36,375 --> 01:04:38,199
Turn the ship around.

717
01:04:38,333 --> 01:04:40,536
Yeah. I think you're right.
Full reverse.

718
01:04:40,666 --> 01:04:42,657
Chewie, lock in
the auxiliary power.

719
01:04:47,416 --> 01:04:49,538
Chewie, lock in
the auxiliary power.

720
01:04:51,583 --> 01:04:53,489
Why are we still
moving towards it?

721
01:04:53,625 --> 01:04:55,414
A tractor beam's pulling us in.

722
01:04:55,541 --> 01:04:57,164
There's gotta be
something you can do.

723
01:04:57,291 --> 01:05:00,123
There's nothing I can do.
I'm at full power. I have to shut down.

724
01:05:00,250 --> 01:05:02,619
They're not gonna get me
without a fight.

725
01:05:06,166 --> 01:05:09,663
You can't win, but there are
alternatives to fighting.

726
01:05:26,333 --> 01:05:28,489
<i>Clear Bay 327.</i>

727
01:05:28,625 --> 01:05:30,911
<i>We are opening
the magnetic field.</i>

728
01:05:45,541 --> 01:05:47,496
To your stations.
Come with me.

729
01:05:52,083 --> 01:05:55,449
<i>Close all outboard shields.
Close all outboard shields.</i>

730
01:05:57,166 --> 01:05:58,079
Yes?

731
01:05:58,208 --> 01:06:01,206
<i>We've captured a freighter entering
the remains of the Alderaan system.</i>

732
01:06:01,333 --> 01:06:05,161
<i>Its markings match those of a ship
that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley.</i>

733
01:06:05,291 --> 01:06:09,036
They must be trying to return
the stolen plans to the princess.

734
01:06:09,166 --> 01:06:12,199
She may yet be of some use to us.

735
01:06:17,291 --> 01:06:20,574
<i>Unlock 1, 5, 7 and 9.
Release charge.</i>

736
01:06:22,791 --> 01:06:24,829
<i>316, report to control.</i>

737
01:06:28,125 --> 01:06:29,782
There's no one on board, sir.

738
01:06:29,916 --> 01:06:32,619
According to the log, the crew
abandoned ship right after take-off.

739
01:06:33,458 --> 01:06:36,242
It must be a decoy. Several
escape pods have been jettisoned.

740
01:06:36,375 --> 01:06:38,282
- Did you find any droids?
- No, sir.

741
01:06:38,416 --> 01:06:40,242
If there were any,
they must have jettisoned.

742
01:06:40,375 --> 01:06:43,822
Send a scanning crew aboard.
I want every part of this ship checked.

743
01:06:43,958 --> 01:06:45,155
Yes, sir.

744
01:06:45,291 --> 01:06:46,833
I sense something...

745
01:06:46,958 --> 01:06:49,411
a presence I've not felt since...

746
01:06:52,125 --> 01:06:55,454
Get me a scanning crew in here.
I want every part of this ship checked.

747
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:06,454
There's no one here.

748
01:07:15,375 --> 01:07:17,496
Boy, it's lucky you had
these compartments.

749
01:07:17,625 --> 01:07:20,657
I use them for smuggling. I never
thought I'd be smuggling myself in 'em.

750
01:07:20,791 --> 01:07:21,952
This is ridiculous.

751
01:07:22,083 --> 01:07:24,572
Even if I could take off,
I'd never get past the tractor beam.

752
01:07:24,708 --> 01:07:25,987
Leave that to me.

753
01:07:26,125 --> 01:07:29,157
Damn fool.
I knew you were gonna say that.

754
01:07:29,291 --> 01:07:32,704
Who's the more foolish,
the fool or the fool who follows him?

755
01:07:42,333 --> 01:07:45,947
The ship's all yours. If the scanners
pick up anything, report it immediately.

756
01:07:47,625 --> 01:07:49,081
Let's go.

757
01:08:03,791 --> 01:08:05,746
Hey, down there.

758
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:09,371
Could you give us a hand with this?

759
01:08:17,792 --> 01:08:20,197
TK-421, why aren't you
at your post?

760
01:08:21,417 --> 01:08:23,408
TK-421, do you copy?

761
01:08:35,417 --> 01:08:38,332
Take over. We've got a bad transmitter.
I'll see what I can do.

762
01:08:56,167 --> 01:08:58,537
Between his howling
and your blasting everything...

763
01:08:58,667 --> 01:09:01,286
it's a wonder the whole station
doesn't know we're here.

764
01:09:01,417 --> 01:09:04,036
Bring 'em on. I prefer a straight fight
to sneakin' around.

765
01:09:04,167 --> 01:09:05,908
We've found
the computer outlet, sir.

766
01:09:06,042 --> 01:09:09,039
Plug in. He should be able to
interpret the entire imperial network.

767
01:09:20,292 --> 01:09:23,704
He's found the controls to the power
beam that's holding the ship here.

768
01:09:23,832 --> 01:09:26,664
He'll try to make the precise location
appear on the monitor.

769
01:09:26,792 --> 01:09:30,998
The tractor beam is coupled
to the main reactor in seven locations.

770
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:34,122
A power loss at one of the terminals
will allow the ship to leave.

771
01:09:36,917 --> 01:09:40,117
I don't think you boys can help.
I must go alone.

772
01:09:40,250 --> 01:09:43,615
Whatever you say. I've done more than
I bargained for on this trip already.

773
01:09:43,750 --> 01:09:47,578
- I want to go with you.
- Be patient, Luke. Watch the droids.

774
01:09:47,707 --> 01:09:49,662
They must be delivered safely...

775
01:09:49,792 --> 01:09:52,908
or other star systems will suffer
the same fate as Alderaan.

776
01:09:53,042 --> 01:09:56,323
Your destiny lies along
a different path from mine.

777
01:09:59,957 --> 01:10:01,864
The Force will be with you...

778
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,408
always.

779
01:10:12,917 --> 01:10:15,157
You said it, Chewie.

780
01:10:15,292 --> 01:10:17,614
Where did you dig up that old fossil?

781
01:10:18,750 --> 01:10:20,326
Ben is a great man.

782
01:10:20,457 --> 01:10:23,326
- Great at getting us into trouble.
- I didn't hear you give any ideas.

783
01:10:23,457 --> 01:10:26,456
Anything's better than just hangin'
around waiting for 'em to pick us up.

784
01:10:26,582 --> 01:10:28,868
Who do you think...

785
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:32,199
- What is it?
- I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.

786
01:10:32,332 --> 01:10:34,868
He says, "I've found her,''
and keeps repeating, "She's here.''

787
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,570
Who? Who has he found?

788
01:10:37,707 --> 01:10:40,409
- Princess Leia.
- The princess? She's here?

789
01:10:40,542 --> 01:10:42,199
- Princess?
- Where is she?

790
01:10:42,332 --> 01:10:44,204
Princess? What's going on?

791
01:10:49,667 --> 01:10:52,416
Level 5, Detention Block AA-23.

792
01:10:57,292 --> 01:10:59,863
I'm afraid she's scheduled
to be terminated.

793
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,951
Oh, no.
We've gotta do something.

794
01:11:03,082 --> 01:11:05,488
- What are you talking about?
- The droids belong to her.

795
01:11:05,625 --> 01:11:07,497
She's the one in the message.
We gotta help her.

796
01:11:07,625 --> 01:11:10,493
Don't get any funny ideas.
The old man wants us to wait here.

797
01:11:10,625 --> 01:11:13,824
He didn't know she was here.
Find a way into that detention block.

798
01:11:13,957 --> 01:11:16,363
- I'm not going anywhere.
- They're gonna execute her.

799
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:20,030
You said you didn't want to just wait
to be captured. Now you want to stay?

800
01:11:20,167 --> 01:11:23,199
Marching into the detention area
is not what I had in mind.

801
01:11:23,332 --> 01:11:26,117
- But they're gonna kill her.
- Better her than me.

802
01:11:33,875 --> 01:11:35,154
She's rich.

803
01:11:37,832 --> 01:11:39,207
Rich?

804
01:11:39,917 --> 01:11:43,911
Rich, powerful. If you were to
rescue her, the reward would be...

805
01:11:44,042 --> 01:11:46,826
- What?
- Well, more well than you can imagine.

806
01:11:46,957 --> 01:11:48,864
I don't know.
I can imagine quite a bit.

807
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,037
- You'll get it.
- I better.

808
01:11:51,167 --> 01:11:52,623
You will.

809
01:11:52,750 --> 01:11:55,154
All right, kid.
You better be right about this.

810
01:11:55,292 --> 01:11:57,247
- All right.
- What's your plan?

811
01:11:58,292 --> 01:12:00,744
3PO, hand me those binders there,
will you?

812
01:12:02,332 --> 01:12:03,707
Okay.

813
01:12:04,417 --> 01:12:06,288
Now, I'm gonna put these on you.

814
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:10,663
Okay, Han,
you put those on.

815
01:12:11,792 --> 01:12:14,197
Don't worry, Chewie.
I think I know what he has in mind.

816
01:12:14,332 --> 01:12:16,703
Master Luke, sir,
pardon me for asking...

817
01:12:16,832 --> 01:12:20,033
but what should R2 and I do
if we're discovered here?

818
01:12:20,167 --> 01:12:23,947
- Lock the door.
- And hope they don't have blasters.

819
01:12:24,082 --> 01:12:26,073
That isn't very reassuring.

820
01:12:46,417 --> 01:12:48,454
<i>517 to scanner control.</i>

821
01:12:48,582 --> 01:12:50,621
<i>517 to scanner control.</i>

822
01:12:54,582 --> 01:12:56,621
<i>316, report to control.</i>

823
01:13:00,292 --> 01:13:02,496
<i>53 to upper bay door.</i>

824
01:13:02,625 --> 01:13:04,948
<i>53 to upper bay door.</i>

825
01:13:17,375 --> 01:13:19,698
I can't see a thing
in this helmet.

826
01:13:51,125 --> 01:13:53,792
- This is not gonna work.
- Why didn't you say so before?

827
01:13:53,917 --> 01:13:55,872
I did say so before.

828
01:14:10,832 --> 01:14:14,033
Where are you
taking this... thing?

829
01:14:14,167 --> 01:14:16,868
Prisoner transfer
from Cell Block 1138.

830
01:14:18,207 --> 01:14:20,114
I wasn't notified.

831
01:14:20,250 --> 01:14:22,204
I'll have to clear it.

832
01:14:28,582 --> 01:14:31,072
- Look out! He's loose!
- He'll tear us all apart!

833
01:14:55,457 --> 01:14:56,122
Look out.

834
01:15:06,707 --> 01:15:09,161
We gotta find out which cell
this princess of yours is in.

835
01:15:09,292 --> 01:15:11,448
Here it is... 2187.
You go and get her.

836
01:15:11,582 --> 01:15:13,537
I'll hold them here.

837
01:15:17,457 --> 01:15:20,029
Everything's under control.
Situation normal.

838
01:15:20,167 --> 01:15:21,328
<i>What happened?</i>

839
01:15:21,457 --> 01:15:23,329
Had a slight weapons malfunction...

840
01:15:23,457 --> 01:15:25,780
but everything's
perfectly all right now.

841
01:15:25,917 --> 01:15:29,081
We're fine. We're all fine here now.
Thank you.

842
01:15:29,207 --> 01:15:31,875
<i>- How are you?
- We're sending a squad up.</i>

843
01:15:32,917 --> 01:15:35,997
Negative, negative.
We have a reactor leak here now.

844
01:15:36,125 --> 01:15:39,988
Give us a few minutes to lock it down.
Large leak, very dangerous.

845
01:15:40,125 --> 01:15:42,659
<i>Who is this?
What's your operating number?</i>

846
01:15:45,125 --> 01:15:48,573
Boring conversation anyway.
Luke, we're gonna have company!

847
01:16:02,250 --> 01:16:04,738
Aren't you a little short
for a stormtrooper?

848
01:16:06,125 --> 01:16:07,582
Oh, the uniform.

849
01:16:09,042 --> 01:16:11,115
I'm Luke Skywalker.
I'm here to rescue you.

850
01:16:11,250 --> 01:16:13,323
- You're who?
- I'm here to rescue you.

851
01:16:13,457 --> 01:16:15,828
I've got your R2 unit.
I'm here with Ben Kenobi.

852
01:16:15,957 --> 01:16:17,912
- Where is he?
- Come on.

853
01:16:19,457 --> 01:16:22,622
- He is here.
- Obi-Wan Kenobi?

854
01:16:23,417 --> 01:16:26,698
- What makes you think so?
- A tremor in the Force.

855
01:16:26,832 --> 01:16:30,661
The last time I felt it
was in the presence of my old master.

856
01:16:30,792 --> 01:16:33,162
Surely he must be dead by now.

857
01:16:33,292 --> 01:16:35,662
Don't underestimate the Force.

858
01:16:36,792 --> 01:16:39,992
The Jedi are extinct.
Their fire has gone out of the universe.

859
01:16:40,875 --> 01:16:43,409
You, my friend, are all that's left
of their religion.

860
01:16:44,292 --> 01:16:45,405
Yes.

861
01:16:45,542 --> 01:16:49,037
<i>We have an emergency alert
in Detention Block AA-23.</i>

862
01:16:49,750 --> 01:16:52,238
The princess?
Put all sections on alert.

863
01:16:52,375 --> 01:16:55,989
Obi-Wan is here.
The Force is with him.

864
01:16:56,125 --> 01:16:58,957
If you're right,
he must not be allowed to escape.

865
01:16:59,082 --> 01:17:02,496
Escape is not his plan.
I must face him alone.

866
01:17:11,832 --> 01:17:13,326
Get behind me.

867
01:17:24,792 --> 01:17:27,493
Watch your left.
They went down the cell bay.

868
01:17:30,582 --> 01:17:33,451
- Can't get out that way.
- You cut off our only escape route.

869
01:17:33,582 --> 01:17:36,202
Maybe you'd like it back in your cell,
Your Highness.

870
01:17:38,625 --> 01:17:40,746
<i>- C-3PO. C-3PO.
- Yes, sir?</i>

871
01:17:40,875 --> 01:17:44,323
Are there any other ways out of
the cell bay? We've been cut off.

872
01:17:46,582 --> 01:17:48,787
What was that?
I didn't copy.

873
01:17:48,917 --> 01:17:52,329
I said all systems have been
alerted to your presence, sir.

874
01:17:52,457 --> 01:17:54,947
The main entrance
seems to be the only way in or out.

875
01:17:55,082 --> 01:17:57,287
All other information on your level
is restricted.

876
01:17:57,417 --> 01:17:59,905
Open up in there.
Open up in there.

877
01:18:00,957 --> 01:18:02,615
Oh, no.

878
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:04,291
There isn't any other way out.

879
01:18:09,917 --> 01:18:12,121
I can't hold them off forever.
Now what?

880
01:18:12,250 --> 01:18:15,746
Some rescue. When you came in here,
didn't you have a plan for getting out?

881
01:18:15,875 --> 01:18:17,829
He's the brains, sweetheart.

882
01:18:17,957 --> 01:18:19,615
Well, I didn't...

883
01:18:20,832 --> 01:18:24,280
- What the hell are you doing?
- Somebody has to save our skins.

884
01:18:26,457 --> 01:18:28,283
Into the garbage chute, fly boy.

885
01:18:35,792 --> 01:18:36,787
Get in!

886
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,997
Get in there, you big furry oaf.
I don't care what you smell.

887
01:18:42,042 --> 01:18:44,494
Get in there,
and don't worry about it.

888
01:18:46,582 --> 01:18:48,039
Wonderful girl.

889
01:18:50,207 --> 01:18:53,372
Either I'm gonna kill her,
or I'm beginning to like her.

890
01:18:54,917 --> 01:18:56,872
Get in there.

891
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:12,948
The garbage chute was
a really wonderful idea.

892
01:19:13,082 --> 01:19:15,453
What an incredible smell
you've discovered.

893
01:19:18,082 --> 01:19:20,287
Let's get out of here.

894
01:19:20,417 --> 01:19:22,703
- Get away from there.
- No, wait.

895
01:19:29,542 --> 01:19:31,864
I already tried it!
It's magnetically sealed.

896
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,239
Put that thing away!
You're gonna get us all killed!

897
01:19:34,375 --> 01:19:36,282
Absolutely, Your Worship.

898
01:19:36,417 --> 01:19:38,703
Look, I had everything under control
till you led us down here.

899
01:19:38,832 --> 01:19:41,701
It's not gonna take 'em long
to figure out what happened to us.

900
01:19:41,832 --> 01:19:43,787
It could be worse.

901
01:19:47,707 --> 01:19:48,952
It's worse.

902
01:19:49,082 --> 01:19:52,081
- There's something alive in here.
- That's your imagination.

903
01:19:53,082 --> 01:19:54,954
Something just moved
past my leg.

904
01:19:56,707 --> 01:19:58,746
Look. Did you see that?

905
01:19:58,875 --> 01:19:59,739
What?

906
01:20:21,417 --> 01:20:22,873
Kid! Luke!

907
01:20:35,667 --> 01:20:37,372
Grab hold of this!

908
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:39,823
Blast it! My gun's jammed.

909
01:20:39,957 --> 01:20:42,707
- Where?
- Anywhere!

910
01:21:15,332 --> 01:21:16,908
Help him!

911
01:21:17,042 --> 01:21:19,494
- What happened?
- I don't know.

912
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:21,911
It just let go of me
and disappeared.

913
01:21:27,957 --> 01:21:29,912
I got a bad feeling about this.

914
01:21:36,042 --> 01:21:39,206
- The walls are moving!
- Try and brace it with something.

915
01:21:48,207 --> 01:21:49,701
Help me.

916
01:22:02,457 --> 01:22:04,081
Wait a minute.

917
01:22:06,167 --> 01:22:09,118
3PO! Come in, 3PO!

918
01:22:10,417 --> 01:22:11,909
<i>3PO!</i>

919
01:22:12,042 --> 01:22:13,997
<i>Where could he be?</i>

920
01:22:18,292 --> 01:22:20,412
Take over. See to him.

921
01:22:22,917 --> 01:22:24,373
Look, there.

922
01:22:26,832 --> 01:22:29,155
They're madmen.
They're heading for the prison level.

923
01:22:29,292 --> 01:22:31,163
If you hurry, you might catch them.

924
01:22:31,292 --> 01:22:32,748
Follow me.

925
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:38,454
You stand guard.

926
01:22:42,707 --> 01:22:43,987
Come on.

927
01:22:52,332 --> 01:22:55,579
All this excitement has overrun
the circuits in my counterpart here.

928
01:22:55,707 --> 01:22:58,824
If you don't mind, I'd like to
take him down to maintenance.

929
01:22:58,957 --> 01:23:00,451
All right.

930
01:23:12,667 --> 01:23:15,368
3PO. Come in, 3PO.

931
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:16,697
3PO.

932
01:23:16,832 --> 01:23:19,664
- Get on top.
- I can't.

933
01:23:19,792 --> 01:23:21,617
Where could he be? 3PO.

934
01:23:23,082 --> 01:23:24,824
3PO, will you come in.

935
01:23:25,625 --> 01:23:27,828
They aren't here.
Something must have happened.

936
01:23:27,957 --> 01:23:30,113
See if they've been captured. Hurry.

937
01:23:34,457 --> 01:23:37,408
One thing's for sure.
We're all gonna be a lot thinner.

938
01:23:39,750 --> 01:23:41,989
- Get on top of it.
- I'm trying.

939
01:23:47,375 --> 01:23:50,740
Thank goodness they haven't found them.
Where could they be?

940
01:23:53,292 --> 01:23:55,614
"Use the comlink''? Oh, my.

941
01:23:55,750 --> 01:23:57,622
I forgot.
I turned it off.

942
01:24:01,832 --> 01:24:03,907
- Are you there, sir?
- 3PO?

943
01:24:04,957 --> 01:24:07,493
<i>- We've had some problems.
- Shut up and listen to me.</i>

944
01:24:07,625 --> 01:24:11,369
<i>Shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level. Do you copy?</i>

945
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:14,118
Shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level!

946
01:24:15,625 --> 01:24:18,195
<i>Shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level!</i>

947
01:24:18,332 --> 01:24:21,082
No, shut them all down.
Hurry! Oh, no.

948
01:24:32,582 --> 01:24:34,039
What?

949
01:24:35,125 --> 01:24:36,997
You did great, 3PO!

950
01:24:37,125 --> 01:24:39,448
Listen to them.
They're dying, R2.

951
01:24:39,582 --> 01:24:41,489
Curse my metal body.
I wasn't fast enough.

952
01:24:41,625 --> 01:24:44,907
It's all my fault.
My poor master.

953
01:24:45,042 --> 01:24:46,582
We're all right.
You did great!

954
01:24:47,542 --> 01:24:51,369
Hey! Open the pressure maintenance
hatch on unit number... Where are we?

955
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:54,829
<i>3263827.</i>

956
01:25:40,542 --> 01:25:44,121
If we can avoid any more female advice,
we oughta be able to get out of here.

957
01:25:44,250 --> 01:25:46,074
Let's get moving.

958
01:25:47,292 --> 01:25:49,448
Where you goin'?

959
01:25:49,582 --> 01:25:50,992
Wait! They'll hear!

960
01:25:53,082 --> 01:25:54,954
Come here, you big coward.

961
01:25:55,082 --> 01:25:56,706
- Chewie, come here.
- Listen.

962
01:25:57,625 --> 01:26:00,327
I don't know who you are
or where you came from...

963
01:26:00,457 --> 01:26:03,242
but from now on,
you do as I tell you, okay?

964
01:26:04,167 --> 01:26:07,034
Look, Your Worshipfulness,
let's get one thing straight.

965
01:26:07,167 --> 01:26:09,786
I take orders
from just one person... me.

966
01:26:10,582 --> 01:26:12,454
It's a wonder you're still alive.

967
01:26:12,582 --> 01:26:15,699
Will somebody get
this big walking carpet out of my way?

968
01:26:15,832 --> 01:26:18,073
No reward is worth this.

969
01:26:28,332 --> 01:26:30,204
Give me regular reports, please.

970
01:26:30,332 --> 01:26:31,411
Right.

971
01:26:33,625 --> 01:26:36,824
- Do you know what's going on?
- Maybe it's another drill.

972
01:26:41,917 --> 01:26:43,872
You seen that new VT-16?

973
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,453
Yeah. Some of the other guys
were telling me about it.

974
01:26:46,582 --> 01:26:48,454
They say it's quite a thing to see.

975
01:26:48,582 --> 01:26:50,489
What was that?

976
01:26:50,625 --> 01:26:53,872
It's nothing. Outgassing.
Don't worry about it.

977
01:26:58,707 --> 01:27:00,912
- There she is.
- C-3PO, do you copy?

978
01:27:01,042 --> 01:27:02,037
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

979
01:27:02,167 --> 01:27:04,038
<i>- Are you safe?
- For the moment.</i>

980
01:27:04,167 --> 01:27:06,453
We're in the main hangar
across from the ship.

981
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:10,076
We're right above you.
Stand by.

982
01:27:10,207 --> 01:27:12,909
You came in that thing?
You're braver than I thought.

983
01:27:13,042 --> 01:27:14,997
Nice. Come on.

984
01:27:18,582 --> 01:27:20,288
It's them.
Blast them.

985
01:27:21,582 --> 01:27:23,324
Get back to the ship!

986
01:27:23,457 --> 01:27:25,364
- Where are you going?
- He certainly has courage.

987
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:29,114
What good will it do us
if he gets himself killed? Come on.

988
01:27:54,082 --> 01:27:56,037
I think we took a wrong turn.

989
01:28:01,042 --> 01:28:01,907
There's no lock.

990
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,868
- That oughta hold them for a while.
- Quick. We've got to get across.

991
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:12,163
- Find the controls to extend the bridge.
- I think I just blasted it.

992
01:28:12,292 --> 01:28:14,033
They're coming through.

993
01:28:36,417 --> 01:28:38,039
Here, hold this.

994
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,408
Here they come.

995
01:29:06,792 --> 01:29:08,284
For luck.

996
01:29:14,457 --> 01:29:18,404
We think they may be splitting up.
They may be on Level 5 and 6 now, sir.

997
01:29:33,292 --> 01:29:34,292
Where could they be?

998
01:29:34,292 --> 01:29:35,239
Where could they be?

999
01:29:39,042 --> 01:29:40,913
Close the blast doors.

1000
01:29:48,042 --> 01:29:50,494
Open the blast doors.
Open the blast doors.

1001
01:30:08,875 --> 01:30:13,615
I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.
We meet again at last.

1002
01:30:14,417 --> 01:30:16,074
The circle is now complete.

1003
01:30:16,207 --> 01:30:18,363
When I left you,
I was but the learner.

1004
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:20,823
Now I am the master.

1005
01:30:20,957 --> 01:30:22,912
Only a master of evil, Darth.

1006
01:30:43,250 --> 01:30:45,489
Your powers are weak, old man.

1007
01:30:45,625 --> 01:30:49,239
You can't win, Darth.
If you strike me down...

1008
01:30:49,375 --> 01:30:52,704
I shall become more powerful
than you can possibly imagine.

1009
01:31:00,207 --> 01:31:02,162
You should not have come back.

1010
01:31:27,957 --> 01:31:29,498
Didn't we just leave this party?

1011
01:31:32,332 --> 01:31:34,537
- What kept you?
- We ran into some old friends.

1012
01:31:34,667 --> 01:31:37,155
- The ship all right?
- Seems okay, if we can get to it.

1013
01:31:37,292 --> 01:31:39,283
I hope the old man got
the tractor beam down.

1014
01:31:53,875 --> 01:31:55,036
Look.

1015
01:31:58,792 --> 01:32:00,747
Come on, R2. We're going.

1016
01:32:02,417 --> 01:32:03,447
Now's our chance. Go!

1017
01:32:33,625 --> 01:32:34,738
Come on!

1018
01:32:35,875 --> 01:32:37,283
Come on!

1019
01:32:37,417 --> 01:32:40,449
- Luke, it's too late!
- Blast the door, kid!

1020
01:32:50,207 --> 01:32:51,701
<i>Run, Luke, run.</i>

1021
01:32:54,957 --> 01:32:58,488
I hope that old man got the tractor beam
down, or this is gonna be a short trip.

1022
01:32:58,625 --> 01:33:00,082
Hit it!

1023
01:33:31,625 --> 01:33:33,497
We're coming up
on their sentry ships.

1024
01:33:33,625 --> 01:33:36,990
Hold them off. Angle the deflector
shields while I charge up the main guns.

1025
01:33:46,207 --> 01:33:48,162
I can't believe he's gone.

1026
01:33:51,792 --> 01:33:53,582
There wasn't anything
you could have done.

1027
01:33:54,417 --> 01:33:56,621
Come on, buddy.
We're not out of this yet.

1028
01:34:13,457 --> 01:34:15,743
You in, kid?
Okay, stay sharp.

1029
01:34:26,625 --> 01:34:27,703
Here they come.

1030
01:34:45,750 --> 01:34:47,574
They're coming in too fast!

1031
01:34:55,582 --> 01:34:59,328
- We've lost the lateral controls.
- Don't worry. She'll hold together.

1032
01:35:00,917 --> 01:35:02,908
Hear me, baby?
Hold together.

1033
01:35:25,042 --> 01:35:26,582
Got him. I got him!

1034
01:35:26,707 --> 01:35:29,078
Great, kid.
Don't get cocky.

1035
01:35:30,292 --> 01:35:31,997
There's still two more.

1036
01:36:05,917 --> 01:36:08,405
- That's it. We did it.
- We did it.

1037
01:36:09,707 --> 01:36:12,161
Help. I think I'm melting.
This is all your fault.

1038
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,658
Are they away?

1039
01:36:21,792 --> 01:36:24,078
They've just made the jump
into hyperspace.

1040
01:36:24,792 --> 01:36:28,158
You're sure the homing beacon
is secure aboard their ship?

1041
01:36:29,417 --> 01:36:31,739
I'm taking an awful risk, Vader.

1042
01:36:31,875 --> 01:36:33,782
This had better work.

1043
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,073
Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh?

1044
01:36:36,832 --> 01:36:39,865
You know, sometimes
I amaze even myself.

1045
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,286
That doesn't sound too hard.

1046
01:36:42,417 --> 01:36:46,032
They let us go. It's the only
explanation for the ease of our escape.

1047
01:36:46,167 --> 01:36:48,916
- You call that easy?
- They're tracking us.

1048
01:36:49,042 --> 01:36:50,783
Not this ship, sister.

1049
01:36:52,082 --> 01:36:54,572
At least the information in R2
is still intact.

1050
01:36:54,707 --> 01:36:57,113
What's so important?
What's he carrying?

1051
01:36:57,250 --> 01:36:59,405
The technical readouts
of that battle station.

1052
01:37:00,457 --> 01:37:03,704
I only hope that when the data's
analysed a weakness can be found.

1053
01:37:03,832 --> 01:37:07,162
- It's not over yet.
- It is for me, sister.

1054
01:37:07,292 --> 01:37:10,658
I ain't in this for your revolution,
and I'm not in it for you, Princess.

1055
01:37:10,792 --> 01:37:13,576
I expect to be well paid.
I'm in it for the money.

1056
01:37:13,707 --> 01:37:15,863
You needn't worry
about your reward.

1057
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,868
If money is all that you love,
then that's what you'll receive.

1058
01:37:22,082 --> 01:37:23,989
Your friend is quite a mercenary.

1059
01:37:24,125 --> 01:37:27,288
I wonder if he really cares
about anything... or anybody.

1060
01:37:28,457 --> 01:37:29,914
I care.

1061
01:37:36,542 --> 01:37:38,118
So...

1062
01:37:38,250 --> 01:37:40,122
what do you
think of her, Han?

1063
01:37:40,250 --> 01:37:42,074
I'm trying not to, kid.

1064
01:37:42,957 --> 01:37:44,202
Good.

1065
01:37:47,625 --> 01:37:50,493
Still, she's got a lot of spirit.

1066
01:37:52,667 --> 01:37:55,699
What do you think?
You think a princess and a guy like me...

1067
01:37:55,832 --> 01:37:56,412
No.

1068
01:38:44,042 --> 01:38:47,206
You're safe. When we heard about
Alderaan, we feared the worst.

1069
01:38:47,332 --> 01:38:49,204
We have no time for sorrows,
Commander.

1070
01:38:49,332 --> 01:38:52,331
You must use the information
in this R2 unit to help plan the attack.

1071
01:38:52,457 --> 01:38:54,412
It's our only hope.

1072
01:39:15,500 --> 01:39:18,167
<i>- Yes.
- We're approaching the planet Yavin.</i>

1073
01:39:18,292 --> 01:39:20,578
<i>The rebel base is on a moon
on the far side.</i>

1074
01:39:20,707 --> 01:39:22,662
<i>We are preparing
to orbit the planet.</i>

1075
01:39:31,667 --> 01:39:33,740
The battle station
is heavily shielded...

1076
01:39:33,875 --> 01:39:37,287
and carries a firepower
greater than half the starfleet.

1077
01:39:38,042 --> 01:39:42,082
Its defences are designed around
a direct large-scale assault.

1078
01:39:42,207 --> 01:39:47,409
A small, one-man fighter should be able
to penetrate the outer defence.

1079
01:39:49,207 --> 01:39:52,988
Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good
are snub fighters against that?

1080
01:39:53,125 --> 01:39:57,663
The Empire doesn't consider a small,
one-man fighter to be any threat...

1081
01:39:57,792 --> 01:39:59,747
or they'd have a tighter defence.

1082
01:40:00,625 --> 01:40:03,824
An analysis of the plans
provided by Princess Leia...

1083
01:40:03,957 --> 01:40:06,956
has demonstrated a weakness
in the battle station.

1084
01:40:07,875 --> 01:40:09,782
The approach will not be easy.

1085
01:40:09,917 --> 01:40:13,033
You're required to manoeuvre
straight down this trench...

1086
01:40:13,167 --> 01:40:15,738
and skim the surface to this point.

1087
01:40:16,625 --> 01:40:19,292
The target area
is only two metres wide.

1088
01:40:19,417 --> 01:40:23,032
It's a small thermal exhaust port
right below the main port.

1089
01:40:24,332 --> 01:40:27,497
The shaft leads directly
to the reactor system.

1090
01:40:27,625 --> 01:40:30,327
A precise hit
will start a chain reaction...

1091
01:40:30,457 --> 01:40:32,662
which should destroy the station.

1092
01:40:32,792 --> 01:40:36,239
Only a precise hit will
set up a chain reaction.

1093
01:40:36,375 --> 01:40:39,492
The shaft is ray-shielded,
so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.

1094
01:40:39,625 --> 01:40:41,746
That's impossible,
even for a computer.

1095
01:40:41,875 --> 01:40:45,619
No, it's not. I used to bull's-eye
womp rats in my T-16 back home.

1096
01:40:45,750 --> 01:40:48,119
They're not much bigger
than two metres.

1097
01:40:48,250 --> 01:40:51,413
Then man your ships,
and may the Force be with you.

1098
01:40:59,667 --> 01:41:02,072
<i>Orbiting the planet
at maximum velocity.</i>

1099
01:41:02,917 --> 01:41:06,578
<i>The moon with the rebel base
will be in range in 30 minutes.</i>

1100
01:41:06,707 --> 01:41:09,279
This will be a day
long remembered.

1101
01:41:09,417 --> 01:41:11,372
It has seen the end of Kenobi...

1102
01:41:11,500 --> 01:41:14,070
and will soon see
the end of the rebellion.

1103
01:41:19,832 --> 01:41:22,238
<i>All flight crews,
man your stations.</i>

1104
01:41:28,542 --> 01:41:31,622
So, you got your reward
and you're just leaving, then?

1105
01:41:31,750 --> 01:41:33,704
That's right. Yeah.

1106
01:41:34,832 --> 01:41:37,404
I got some old debts
I gotta pay off with this stuff.

1107
01:41:37,542 --> 01:41:41,582
Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be
fool enough to stick around here, do ya?

1108
01:41:41,707 --> 01:41:45,287
Why don't you come with us? You're
pretty good in a fight. We could use ya.

1109
01:41:45,417 --> 01:41:48,368
Come on. Why don't you
take a look around?

1110
01:41:48,500 --> 01:41:51,118
You know what's about to happen,
what they're up against.

1111
01:41:51,250 --> 01:41:53,998
They could use a good pilot like you.
You're turning your back on them.

1112
01:41:54,125 --> 01:41:56,494
What good's a reward
if you ain't around to use it?

1113
01:41:56,625 --> 01:41:59,539
Besides, attacking that battle station
ain't my idea of courage.

1114
01:41:59,667 --> 01:42:02,498
It's more like... suicide.

1115
01:42:03,957 --> 01:42:07,158
All right.
Well, take care of yourself, Han.

1116
01:42:07,292 --> 01:42:09,911
I guess that's what you're best at,
isn't it?

1117
01:42:10,042 --> 01:42:11,320
Hey, Luke.

1118
01:42:14,707 --> 01:42:17,030
May the Force be with you.

1119
01:42:23,625 --> 01:42:26,742
What are you looking at?
I know what I'm doing.

1120
01:42:31,167 --> 01:42:33,619
<i>All pilots to your stations.</i>

1121
01:42:42,582 --> 01:42:44,823
- What's wrong?
- It's Han.

1122
01:42:44,957 --> 01:42:47,363
I don't know.
I really thought he'd change his mind.

1123
01:42:47,500 --> 01:42:50,948
He's got to follow his own path.
No one can choose it for him.

1124
01:42:52,042 --> 01:42:54,447
I only wish Ben were here.

1125
01:43:02,500 --> 01:43:04,537
<i>Open main launch tubes.</i>

1126
01:43:05,417 --> 01:43:07,372
<i>Main launch tubes opening, sir.</i>

1127
01:43:07,500 --> 01:43:09,158
Hey, Luke!

1128
01:43:09,292 --> 01:43:12,408
- Biggs!
- I don't believe it. How are ya?

1129
01:43:12,542 --> 01:43:14,579
- Coming up?
- I'll be up there with you.

1130
01:43:14,707 --> 01:43:16,993
- Have I got stories to tell you.
- Skywalker.

1131
01:43:18,707 --> 01:43:20,579
Are you sure
you can handle this ship?

1132
01:43:20,707 --> 01:43:24,073
Sir, Luke is the best bush pilot
in the outer-rim territories.

1133
01:43:24,832 --> 01:43:27,322
- You'll do all right.
- Thank you, sir. I'll try.

1134
01:43:27,457 --> 01:43:31,322
Gotta get aboard. We'll hear all your
stories when we get back, all right?

1135
01:43:31,457 --> 01:43:34,125
Hey, Biggs.
I told you I'd make it someday.

1136
01:43:34,250 --> 01:43:37,201
It'll be like old times, Luke.
They'll never stop us.

1137
01:43:40,125 --> 01:43:42,993
This R2 unit of yours seems
a bit beat up. You want a new one?

1138
01:43:43,125 --> 01:43:46,242
Not on your life. That droid and I
have been through a lot.

1139
01:43:46,375 --> 01:43:47,323
You okay, R2?

1140
01:43:49,042 --> 01:43:50,416
Good.

1141
01:43:51,500 --> 01:43:54,202
<i>Gold squadron,
begin take-off procedure.</i>

1142
01:43:54,917 --> 01:43:57,868
Hang on tight, R2.
You've got to come back.

1143
01:43:59,792 --> 01:44:01,747
You wouldn't want my life
to get boring, would you?

1144
01:44:50,082 --> 01:44:53,033
<i>Luke, the Force will be with you.</i>

1145
01:45:05,125 --> 01:45:08,573
<i>Standby alert.
Death Star approaching.</i>

1146
01:45:08,707 --> 01:45:11,788
<i>Estimated time to firing range,
15 minutes.</i>

1147
01:45:24,957 --> 01:45:27,162
- All wings report in.
- Red 10 standing by.

1148
01:45:27,292 --> 01:45:29,496
<i>- Red Seven standing by.
- Red Three standing by.</i>

1149
01:45:29,625 --> 01:45:32,327
<i>- Red Six standing by.
- Red Nine standing by.</i>

1150
01:45:32,457 --> 01:45:34,448
<i>- Red Two standing by.
- Red 11 standing by.</i>

1151
01:45:34,582 --> 01:45:36,454
Red Five standing by.

1152
01:45:37,875 --> 01:45:39,747
Lock S-foils in attack position.

1153
01:45:44,042 --> 01:45:45,997
<i>We're passing through
the magnetic field.</i>

1154
01:45:46,125 --> 01:45:48,873
Hold tight.
Switch your deflectors on.

1155
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:50,408
<i>Double front.</i>

1156
01:45:53,457 --> 01:45:55,199
Look at the size of that thing.

1157
01:45:55,332 --> 01:45:57,904
<i>Cut the chatter, Red Two.
Accelerate to attack speed.</i>

1158
01:46:01,332 --> 01:46:04,034
- This is it, boys.
- Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.

1159
01:46:04,167 --> 01:46:06,998
<i>- I copy, Gold Leader.
- We're starting for the target shaft.</i>

1160
01:46:07,125 --> 01:46:10,537
We're in position. I'm going to cut
across the axis and draw their fire.

1161
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:28,247
<i>- Heavy fire, boss, 23 degrees.
- I see it. Stay low.</i>

1162
01:46:35,707 --> 01:46:37,164
This is Red Five.
I'm going in.

1163
01:46:41,792 --> 01:46:42,739
<i>Luke, pull up!</i>

1164
01:46:44,707 --> 01:46:46,746
- You all right?
- A little cooked, but I'm okay.

1165
01:46:52,750 --> 01:46:56,659
We count 30 rebel ships, but they're so
small they're evading our turbolasers.

1166
01:46:56,792 --> 01:46:58,663
We'll have to destroy
them ship to ship.

1167
01:46:58,792 --> 01:47:00,783
Get the crews
to their fighters.

1168
01:47:03,457 --> 01:47:04,323
Watch yourself.

1169
01:47:04,457 --> 01:47:07,242
<i>There's a lot of fire coming from
the right side of that deflection tower.</i>

1170
01:47:07,375 --> 01:47:08,618
I'm on it.

1171
01:47:08,750 --> 01:47:12,115
- I'm going in. Cover me, Porkins.
- Right with you, Red Three.

1172
01:47:18,542 --> 01:47:20,283
I've got a problem here.

1173
01:47:20,417 --> 01:47:21,791
- Eject.
- I can hold it.

1174
01:47:21,917 --> 01:47:24,073
- Pull up!
- No, I'm all right...

1175
01:47:28,292 --> 01:47:31,207
<i>The rebel base will be in firing range
in seven minutes.</i>

1176
01:47:35,082 --> 01:47:37,750
<i>Luke, trust your feelings.</i>

1177
01:47:45,582 --> 01:47:47,158
Squad leaders...

1178
01:47:47,292 --> 01:47:49,329
we've picked up
a new group of signals.

1179
01:47:49,457 --> 01:47:51,329
Enemy fighters
coming your way.

1180
01:47:51,457 --> 01:47:53,115
My scope's negative.
I don't see anything.

1181
01:47:53,250 --> 01:47:55,405
<i>- Pick up your visual scanning.
- Here they come.</i>

1182
01:47:58,707 --> 01:48:00,365
You've got one on your tail.

1183
01:48:05,750 --> 01:48:06,578
I'm hit!

1184
01:48:08,082 --> 01:48:10,572
- You've picked one up. Watch it.
- I can't see it.

1185
01:48:12,625 --> 01:48:14,283
He's on me tight.
I can't shake him.

1186
01:48:16,042 --> 01:48:18,079
I'll be right there.

1187
01:48:30,292 --> 01:48:33,622
Several fighters have broken off
from the main group. Come with me.

1188
01:48:37,125 --> 01:48:40,206
<i>- Fall in. Fall in.
- Watch your back, Luke.</i>

1189
01:48:40,332 --> 01:48:42,618
<i>Fighters above you, coming in.</i>

1190
01:48:48,917 --> 01:48:51,666
I'm hit, but not bad.
R2, see what you can do with it.

1191
01:48:51,792 --> 01:48:53,865
<i>Hang on back there.</i>

1192
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,618
<i>Red Six, can you see Red Five?</i>

1193
01:48:56,750 --> 01:48:59,119
<i>There's a heavy fire zone.
Red Five, where are you?</i>

1194
01:48:59,250 --> 01:49:00,623
I can't shake him.

1195
01:49:04,707 --> 01:49:06,201
I'm on him, Luke.

1196
01:49:09,457 --> 01:49:11,033
Blast it, Biggs.
Where are you?

1197
01:49:18,082 --> 01:49:20,832
<i>- Thanks, Wedge.
- Good shooting, Wedge.</i>

1198
01:49:20,957 --> 01:49:24,038
<i>Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.
We're starting our attack run.</i>

1199
01:49:25,917 --> 01:49:28,239
<i>I copy, Gold Leader.
Move into position.</i>

1200
01:49:30,707 --> 01:49:32,948
Stay in attack formation.

1201
01:49:33,082 --> 01:49:35,914
<i>The exhaust port
is marked and locked in.</i>

1202
01:49:41,792 --> 01:49:44,908
<i>Switch all power
to front deflector screen.</i>

1203
01:49:45,042 --> 01:49:48,242
Switch all power
to front deflector screen.

1204
01:49:52,957 --> 01:49:54,663
How many guns do you think,
Gold Five?

1205
01:49:54,792 --> 01:49:57,992
<i>Say about 20 guns,
some on the surface, some on the towers.</i>

1206
01:49:58,125 --> 01:50:00,908
<i>Death Star will be in range
in five minutes.</i>

1207
01:50:03,082 --> 01:50:06,081
Switch to targeting computer.

1208
01:50:08,582 --> 01:50:10,537
Computer's locked.
Getting a signal.

1209
01:50:12,957 --> 01:50:15,032
The guns. They've stopped.

1210
01:50:16,792 --> 01:50:19,280
Stabilize your rear deflectors.
Watch for enemy fighters.

1211
01:50:19,417 --> 01:50:21,822
<i>They're coming in.
Three marks at 210.</i>

1212
01:50:23,875 --> 01:50:25,996
I'll take them myself.
Cover me.

1213
01:50:26,125 --> 01:50:27,368
Yes, sir.

1214
01:50:41,917 --> 01:50:44,322
- It's no good. I can't manoeuvre.
- Stay on target.

1215
01:50:44,457 --> 01:50:46,283
- We're too close.
- Stay on target.

1216
01:50:48,125 --> 01:50:49,037
Loosen up!

1217
01:50:52,167 --> 01:50:54,916
Gold Five to Red Leader,
lost Tiree, lost Hutch.

1218
01:50:55,042 --> 01:50:57,364
- I copy, Gold Leader.
- They came from behind.

1219
01:51:03,750 --> 01:51:06,320
We've analysed their attack, sir,
and there is a danger.

1220
01:51:06,457 --> 01:51:08,329
Should I have your ship
standing by?

1221
01:51:08,457 --> 01:51:11,326
Evacuate?
In our moment of triumph?

1222
01:51:11,457 --> 01:51:13,863
I think you overestimate
their chances.

1223
01:51:14,625 --> 01:51:16,579
<i>Rebel base,
three minutes and closing.</i>

1224
01:51:17,375 --> 01:51:19,164
Red boys, this is Red Leader.

1225
01:51:19,292 --> 01:51:20,997
<i>Rendezvous at mark 6. 1.</i>

1226
01:51:21,125 --> 01:51:24,739
<i>- This is Red Two flying toward you.
- Red Three standing by.</i>

1227
01:51:24,875 --> 01:51:26,664
Red Leader, this is Base One.

1228
01:51:26,792 --> 01:51:29,411
<i>Keep half your group out of range
for the next run.</i>

1229
01:51:29,542 --> 01:51:32,113
<i>Copy, Base One.
Luke, take Red Two and Three.</i>

1230
01:51:32,250 --> 01:51:35,579
Hold up here and wait for
my signal to start your run.

1231
01:51:44,042 --> 01:51:45,203
This is it.

1232
01:51:49,792 --> 01:51:51,912
We should be able
to see it by now.

1233
01:51:53,582 --> 01:51:55,288
Keep your eyes open
for those fighters.

1234
01:51:57,125 --> 01:51:59,494
There's too much interference.
Red Five, can you see them?

1235
01:51:59,625 --> 01:52:02,576
- No sign of any... Wait. Coming in.35.
- I see them.

1236
01:52:04,167 --> 01:52:05,244
I'm in range.

1237
01:52:06,542 --> 01:52:08,247
Target's coming up.

1238
01:52:10,832 --> 01:52:12,907
Just hold them off
for a few seconds.

1239
01:52:13,792 --> 01:52:15,332
Close up formation.

1240
01:52:16,750 --> 01:52:18,905
Almost there.

1241
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:31,247
- Let her loose. They're right behind me.
- Almost there.

1242
01:52:32,625 --> 01:52:34,247
I can't hold them.

1243
01:52:42,500 --> 01:52:43,198
It's away!

1244
01:52:47,750 --> 01:52:49,326
<i>- It's a hit!
- Negative.</i>

1245
01:52:49,457 --> 01:52:51,496
Negative. It didn't go in.

1246
01:52:51,625 --> 01:52:54,243
<i>It just impacted on the surface.</i>

1247
01:53:00,750 --> 01:53:02,372
<i>Red Leader, we're right above you.</i>

1248
01:53:02,500 --> 01:53:04,655
Turn to.05.
We'll cover for you.

1249
01:53:04,792 --> 01:53:07,659
<i>Stay there. I just lost
my starboard engine.</i>

1250
01:53:08,500 --> 01:53:10,739
<i>Get set up for your attack run.</i>

1251
01:53:24,082 --> 01:53:26,618
<i>Rebel base, one minute and closing.</i>

1252
01:53:27,417 --> 01:53:28,957
<i>Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up.</i>

1253
01:53:29,082 --> 01:53:32,412
<i>We're going in full throttle. That ought
to keep those fighters off our back.</i>

1254
01:53:32,625 --> 01:53:34,615
Right with you, boss.

1255
01:53:34,750 --> 01:53:36,989
Luke, at that speed,
will you be able to pull out in time?

1256
01:53:37,125 --> 01:53:39,079
It'll be just like
Beggars Canyon back home.

1257
01:53:46,457 --> 01:53:48,662
We'll stay back
far enough to cover you.

1258
01:53:48,792 --> 01:53:51,327
<i>My scope shows the tower,
but I can't see the exhaust port.</i>

1259
01:53:51,457 --> 01:53:52,914
Are you sure
the computer can hit it?

1260
01:53:56,417 --> 01:53:58,372
Watch yourself.
Increase speed, full throttle.

1261
01:53:58,500 --> 01:53:59,743
What about that tower?

1262
01:53:59,875 --> 01:54:02,244
You worry about those fighters.
I'll worry about the tower.

1263
01:54:08,707 --> 01:54:12,238
R2, that stabilizer's broken loose
again. See if you can't lock it down.

1264
01:54:21,457 --> 01:54:23,199
<i>Fighters coming in.3.</i>

1265
01:54:32,167 --> 01:54:34,619
<i>- I'm hit. I can't stay with you.
- Get clear, Wedge.</i>

1266
01:54:34,750 --> 01:54:37,203
- You can't do any more good back there.
- Sorry.

1267
01:54:38,292 --> 01:54:40,198
Let him go.
Stay on the leader.

1268
01:54:43,207 --> 01:54:45,412
Hurry, Luke.
They're coming in much faster this time.

1269
01:54:49,582 --> 01:54:52,250
R2, try and increase the power.

1270
01:54:57,667 --> 01:54:58,863
<i>Hurry up, Luke. Quick.</i>

1271
01:54:59,832 --> 01:55:00,911
Quick.

1272
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,488
<i>Rebel base, 30 seconds and closing.</i>

1273
01:55:10,625 --> 01:55:11,703
I'm on the leader.

1274
01:55:15,207 --> 01:55:16,617
Hang on, R2.

1275
01:55:32,082 --> 01:55:34,618
<i>Use the Force, Luke.</i>

1276
01:55:37,292 --> 01:55:39,911
<i>Let go, Luke.</i>

1277
01:55:41,375 --> 01:55:43,698
The Force is strong with this one.

1278
01:55:43,832 --> 01:55:45,739
<i>Luke, trust me.</i>

1279
01:55:50,957 --> 01:55:52,747
<i>His computer's off.</i>

1280
01:55:52,875 --> 01:55:54,996
<i>You switched off your
targeting computer. What's wrong?</i>

1281
01:55:55,125 --> 01:55:57,659
<i>Nothing. I'm all right.</i>

1282
01:56:10,667 --> 01:56:11,863
<i>I've lost R2.</i>

1283
01:56:13,792 --> 01:56:15,829
<i>The Death Star has cleared the planet.</i>

1284
01:56:15,957 --> 01:56:18,243
<i>The Death Star has cleared the planet.</i>

1285
01:56:19,332 --> 01:56:20,908
<i>Rebel base in range.</i>

1286
01:56:21,042 --> 01:56:22,913
You may fire when ready.

1287
01:56:23,667 --> 01:56:25,076
<i>Commence primary ignition.</i>

1288
01:56:39,082 --> 01:56:40,457
I have you now.

1289
01:56:42,957 --> 01:56:44,072
What?

1290
01:56:46,750 --> 01:56:47,496
Look out.

1291
01:56:54,417 --> 01:56:57,201
You're all clear, kid.
Now let's blow this thing and go home.

1292
01:57:04,082 --> 01:57:05,362
<i>Stand by.</i>

1293
01:57:08,417 --> 01:57:10,074
<i>Stand by.</i>

1294
01:57:20,582 --> 01:57:22,454
Great shot, kid!
That was one in a million!

1295
01:57:23,957 --> 01:57:28,331
<i>Remember, the Force
will be with you always.</i>

1296
01:57:53,792 --> 01:57:55,663
I just knew you'd come back.

1297
01:57:55,792 --> 01:57:58,162
I wasn't gonna let you get all
the credit and take all the reward.

1298
01:57:58,292 --> 01:58:00,247
I knew there was
more to you than money.

1299
01:58:00,957 --> 01:58:02,202
Oh, no.

1300
01:58:02,332 --> 01:58:04,738
Oh, my.
R2, can you hear me?

1301
01:58:05,457 --> 01:58:08,289
Say something.
You can repair him, can't you?

1302
01:58:08,417 --> 01:58:11,617
- We'll get to work on him right away.
- You must repair him.

1303
01:58:11,750 --> 01:58:14,618
Sir, if any of my circuits or gears
will help, I'll gladly donate them.

1304
01:58:14,750 --> 01:58:16,704
He'll be all right.
