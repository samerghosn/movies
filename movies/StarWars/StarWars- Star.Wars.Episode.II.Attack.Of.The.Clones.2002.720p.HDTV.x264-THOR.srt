1
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:15,044
Senator, we're making
our final approach into Coruscant.

2
00:02:15,146 --> 00:02:17,170
Very good, Lieutenant.

3
00:03:07,942 --> 00:03:10,740
We made it.

4
00:03:14,014 --> 00:03:15,914
<i>I guess I was wrong.</i>

5
00:03:16,016 --> 00:03:18,247
There was no danger at all.

6
00:03:37,437 --> 00:03:39,997
Cordé.

7
00:03:40,108 --> 00:03:43,043
Milady, I'm so sorry.

8
00:03:43,144 --> 00:03:45,271
<i>I've failed you, Senator.</i>

9
00:03:46,313 --> 00:03:48,338
No.

10
00:03:50,617 --> 00:03:52,643
Milady, you're still
in danger here.

11
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:02,951
- I shouldn't have come back.
- This vote is very important.

12
00:04:03,063 --> 00:04:06,625
You did your duty.
Cordé did hers. Now, come.

13
00:04:08,568 --> 00:04:10,695
Senator Amidala,
please.

14
00:04:21,516 --> 00:04:26,009
I don't know how much longer
I can hold off the vote, my friends.

15
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,180
More and more star systems
are joining the separatists.

16
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:32,691
- If they do break away--
- I will not let this Republic...

17
00:04:32,793 --> 00:04:36,389
that has stood for a thousand years
be split in two.

18
00:04:36,497 --> 00:04:39,694
My negotiations
will not fail.

19
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,329
<i>If they do, you must realize there aren't
enough Jedi to protect the Republic.</i>

20
00:04:44,437 --> 00:04:47,965
We're keepers of the peace,
not soldiers.

21
00:04:49,509 --> 00:04:51,978
<i>Master Yoda.</i>

22
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:54,774
Do you think it will
really come to war?

23
00:04:55,949 --> 00:05:00,579
Hmm, the dark side
clouds everything.

24
00:05:00,687 --> 00:05:05,648
Impossible to see
the future is.

25
00:05:07,495 --> 00:05:10,658
The Loyalist Committee
has arrived, Your Honor.

26
00:05:10,764 --> 00:05:13,495
<i>Good.</i>

27
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,502
Send them in.

28
00:05:16,603 --> 00:05:19,072
<i>We will discuss</i>
<i>this matter later.</i>

29
00:05:23,644 --> 00:05:27,545
Senator Amidala,
your tragedy on the landing platform--

30
00:05:27,648 --> 00:05:29,673
terrible.

31
00:05:29,783 --> 00:05:33,447
Seeing you alive
brings warm feelings to my heart.

32
00:05:33,553 --> 00:05:36,283
Do you have any idea
who was behind this attack?

33
00:05:36,389 --> 00:05:40,985
Our intelligence points to disgruntled
spice miners on the moons of Naboo.

34
00:05:41,095 --> 00:05:43,961
I think that Count Dooku
was behind it.

35
00:05:44,064 --> 00:05:47,966
He is a political idealist,
not a murderer.

36
00:05:48,069 --> 00:05:51,163
You know, milady,
Count Dooku was once a Jedi.

37
00:05:51,271 --> 00:05:54,639
He couldn't assassinate anyone.
It's not in his character.

38
00:05:54,742 --> 00:05:57,302
<i>But for certain,</i>
<i>Senator...</i>

39
00:05:57,411 --> 00:06:01,245
in grave danger you are.

40
00:06:02,415 --> 00:06:05,317
Master Jedi,
may I suggest...

41
00:06:05,418 --> 00:06:07,319
the senator
be placed...

42
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,514
under the protection
of your graces.

43
00:06:09,624 --> 00:06:12,889
Do you really think that's a wise
decision under these stressful times?

44
00:06:12,994 --> 00:06:14,894
Chancellor, if I may comment,
I do not believe--

45
00:06:14,995 --> 00:06:17,829
The situation
is that serious?

46
00:06:17,932 --> 00:06:19,899
No, but I do, Senator.

47
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,367
<i>I realize all too well</i>
<i>that additional security...</i>

48
00:06:23,471 --> 00:06:25,701
<i>might be</i>
<i>disruptive for you...</i>

49
00:06:25,805 --> 00:06:29,935
<i>but perhaps someone</i>
<i>you're familiar with.</i>

50
00:06:30,043 --> 00:06:33,877
An old friend,
like Master Kenobi.

51
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:36,245
<i>That's possible.</i>

52
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:39,113
He's just returned
from a border dispute on Ansion.

53
00:06:40,321 --> 00:06:42,413
Do it for me, milady.
Please?

54
00:06:42,523 --> 00:06:44,923
<i>The thought</i>
<i>of losing you...</i>

55
00:06:46,793 --> 00:06:48,728
is unbearable.

56
00:06:48,829 --> 00:06:51,627
I will have Obi-Wan
report to you immediately, milady.

57
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,067
<i>Thank you, Master Windu.</i>

58
00:07:04,377 --> 00:07:06,971
You seem
a little on edge.

59
00:07:07,081 --> 00:07:09,072
- Not at all.
- I haven't felt you this tense...

60
00:07:09,182 --> 00:07:11,413
since we fell into
that nest of gundarks.

61
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:14,545
You fell into
that nightmare, Master...

62
00:07:14,654 --> 00:07:17,452
and I rescued you,
remember?

63
00:07:17,557 --> 00:07:20,584
Oh... yes.

64
00:07:25,031 --> 00:07:29,059
You're sweating. Relax.
Take a deep breath.

65
00:07:30,204 --> 00:07:32,262
I haven't seen her
in ten years, Master.

66
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,685
Obi? Obi!

67
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:52,122
Mesa so smilen
to seein yousa!

68
00:07:52,225 --> 00:07:55,524
- Good to see you again, JarJar.
- <i>Senator Padmé.</i>

69
00:07:55,629 --> 00:07:59,257
Mesa palos here!
Lookie, lookie, Senator.

70
00:07:59,367 --> 00:08:01,334
<i>Des a Jedi arriven.</i>

71
00:08:05,973 --> 00:08:08,668
It's a great pleasure
to see you again, milady.

72
00:08:08,776 --> 00:08:11,266
It has been far too long,
Master Kenobi.

73
00:08:12,913 --> 00:08:15,745
Ani? My goodness,
you've grown.

74
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:19,980
So have you.
Grown more beautiful, I mean.

75
00:08:20,086 --> 00:08:22,783
Well, f-for a senator,
I mean.

76
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:28,288
Ani, you'll always be that little boy
I knew on Tatooine.

77
00:08:29,863 --> 00:08:33,322
Our presence here will be invisible,
milady, I can assure you.

78
00:08:33,433 --> 00:08:35,868
I'm Captain Typho
of Her Majesty's security service.

79
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:38,062
Queen Jamillia has been informed
of your assignment.

80
00:08:38,172 --> 00:08:40,298
I am grateful you are here,
Master Kenobi.

81
00:08:40,408 --> 00:08:43,172
The situation is more dangerous
than the senator will admit.

82
00:08:43,277 --> 00:08:45,972
I don't need more security.
I need answers.

83
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,309
I want to know
who's trying to kill me.

84
00:08:48,415 --> 00:08:52,216
We are here to protect you, Senator,
not to start an investigation.

85
00:08:52,318 --> 00:08:54,719
We will find out
who's trying to kill you, Padmé.

86
00:08:54,822 --> 00:08:57,915
- I promise you.
- We will not exceed our mandate...

87
00:08:58,024 --> 00:08:59,924
my young Padawan learner.

88
00:09:00,027 --> 00:09:02,552
I meant that in the interest
of protecting her, Master.

89
00:09:02,663 --> 00:09:05,187
<i>We will not go through</i>
<i>this exercise again, Anakin...</i>

90
00:09:05,298 --> 00:09:08,096
- and you will pay attention to my lead.
- Why?

91
00:09:08,201 --> 00:09:11,193
What?

92
00:09:11,304 --> 00:09:15,035
Why else do you think we were assigned
to her if not to find the killer?

93
00:09:15,142 --> 00:09:18,407
Protection is a job
for local security, not Jedi.

94
00:09:18,511 --> 00:09:21,379
It's overkill, Master.
Investigation is implied in our mandate.

95
00:09:21,481 --> 00:09:24,746
We will do exactly
as the council has instructed.

96
00:09:27,221 --> 00:09:30,246
And you will learn
your place, young one.

97
00:09:33,726 --> 00:09:35,751
Perhaps with
merely your presence...

98
00:09:35,863 --> 00:09:38,798
the mystery surrounding
this threat will be revealed.

99
00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:41,663
Now, if you'll
excuse me...

100
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:43,736
I will retire.

101
00:09:45,105 --> 00:09:47,073
I know I'll feel better
having you here.

102
00:09:47,173 --> 00:09:51,133
I'll have an officer stationed on every floor,
and I'll be in the control center downstairs.

103
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,072
Mesa busten wit happiness
seein yousa again, Ani.

104
00:09:56,182 --> 00:09:59,311
<i>She hardly even</i>
<i>recognized me, JarJar.</i>

105
00:10:00,955 --> 00:10:03,855
I've thought about her
every day since we parted, and...

106
00:10:05,225 --> 00:10:07,216
she's forgotten me completely.

107
00:10:07,327 --> 00:10:11,457
Shesa happy. Happier den
mesa seein her in a longo time.

108
00:10:11,565 --> 00:10:15,591
You're focusing on the negative, Anakin.
Be mindful of your thoughts.

109
00:10:15,702 --> 00:10:18,136
She was pleased to see us.

110
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,230
Now, let's check the security.

111
00:10:29,182 --> 00:10:31,309
I hit the ship,
but they used a decoy.

112
00:10:31,418 --> 00:10:33,977
We'll have to try something
more subtle this time, Zam.

113
00:10:34,087 --> 00:10:36,817
My client is getting impatient.
Take these.

114
00:10:36,923 --> 00:10:38,788
Be careful.
They're very poisonous.

115
00:10:38,893 --> 00:10:41,986
Zam, there can be
no mistakes this time.

116
00:10:45,832 --> 00:10:49,599
Captain Typho has more than enough men
downstairs. No assassin would try that way.

117
00:10:50,703 --> 00:10:53,229
- Any activity up here?
- Quiet as a tomb.

118
00:10:54,807 --> 00:10:57,275
I don't like just waiting here
for something to happen to her.

119
00:10:57,378 --> 00:10:59,346
What's going on?

120
00:10:59,446 --> 00:11:01,846
Ah, she covered
the cameras.

121
00:11:01,948 --> 00:11:04,008
I don't think
she liked me watching her.

122
00:11:04,118 --> 00:11:06,018
What is she thinking?

123
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,145
She programmed R2
to warn us if there is an intruder.

124
00:11:09,255 --> 00:11:11,850
<i>There are many</i>
<i>other ways to kill a senator.</i>

125
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:16,327
<i>I know, but we also want to</i>
<i>catch this assassin, don't we, Master?</i>

126
00:11:18,499 --> 00:11:20,524
You're using her as bait.

127
00:11:20,634 --> 00:11:22,726
It was her idea.

128
00:11:22,836 --> 00:11:25,360
Don't worry.
No harm will come to her.

129
00:11:25,471 --> 00:11:28,463
I can sense everything
going on in that room.

130
00:11:28,576 --> 00:11:30,840
Trust me.

131
00:11:30,945 --> 00:11:33,209
It's too risky.

132
00:11:33,313 --> 00:11:36,841
Besides, your senses aren't
that attuned, my young apprentice.

133
00:11:36,951 --> 00:11:38,975
And yours are?

134
00:11:41,154 --> 00:11:43,054
Possibly.

135
00:11:57,471 --> 00:11:59,995
You look tired.

136
00:12:00,106 --> 00:12:02,075
I don't sleep well anymore.

137
00:12:02,176 --> 00:12:04,701
Because of your mother?

138
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:12,682
I don't know why
I keep dreaming about her.

139
00:12:15,422 --> 00:12:17,355
Dreams pass in time.

140
00:12:18,892 --> 00:12:21,451
I'd much rather dream
about Padmé.

141
00:12:21,562 --> 00:12:25,759
Just being around her again
is... intoxicating.

142
00:12:25,865 --> 00:12:28,562
Be mindful of your thoughts, Anakin.
They betray you.

143
00:12:28,668 --> 00:12:32,969
You've made a commitment to the Jedi
order, a commitment not easily broken.

144
00:12:33,072 --> 00:12:35,870
And don't forget, she's a politician,
and they're not to be trusted.

145
00:12:35,975 --> 00:12:38,536
<i>She's not like the others</i>
<i>in the senate, Master.</i>

146
00:12:38,645 --> 00:12:40,580
<i>It is my experience</i>
<i>that senators...</i>

147
00:12:40,681 --> 00:12:44,412
<i>focus only on pleasing those</i>
<i>who fund their campaigns...</i>

148
00:12:44,518 --> 00:12:48,078
<i>and they're in no means scared of</i>
<i>forgetting the niceties of democracy...</i>

149
00:12:48,187 --> 00:12:50,383
- <i>in order to get those funds.</i>
- <i>Not another lecture.</i>

150
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:53,288
<i>At least not on</i>
<i>the economics of politics.</i>

151
00:13:48,915 --> 00:13:51,942
<i>And besides,</i>
<i>you're generalizing.</i>

152
00:13:52,052 --> 00:13:55,543
- The chancellor doesn't appear to be corrupt.
- Palpatine is a politician.

153
00:13:55,655 --> 00:13:58,317
<i>I have observed</i>
<i>that he is very clever...</i>

154
00:13:58,424 --> 00:14:02,384
<i>in following the passions</i>
<i>and the prejudices of the senators.</i>

155
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,395
I think he's a good man. My--

156
00:14:04,498 --> 00:14:06,398
I sense it too.

157
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:25,577
Stay here!

158
00:14:27,988 --> 00:14:29,922
Are you all right,
milady?

159
00:14:37,865 --> 00:14:39,855
Ah!

160
00:15:03,724 --> 00:15:07,091
What the--

161
00:15:14,201 --> 00:15:15,895
<i>Jedi poo doo!</i>

162
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:20,028
- What took you so long?
- Oh, you know, Master.

163
00:16:20,133 --> 00:16:23,000
- I couldn't find a speeder that I really liked...
- There he is.

164
00:16:23,102 --> 00:16:26,504
with the open cockpit and
the right speed capabilities.

165
00:16:26,606 --> 00:16:29,837
If you spent as much time practicing your
saber techniques as you do your wit...

166
00:16:29,942 --> 00:16:31,967
you would rival Master Yoda
as a swordsman.

167
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:35,879
- I thought I already did.
- Only in your mind, my very young apprentice.

168
00:17:04,344 --> 00:17:06,811
Pull up, Anakin. Pull up!

169
00:17:14,086 --> 00:17:16,884
- You know I don't like it when you do that.
- Sorry, Master.

170
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:19,390
I forgot you
don't like flying.

171
00:17:19,492 --> 00:17:22,326
I don't mind flying,
but what you're doing is suicide.

172
00:17:50,624 --> 00:17:54,684
Anakin! How many times
have I told you-- Ah!--

173
00:17:54,795 --> 00:17:56,922
- Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
- stay away from power couplings!

174
00:17:58,565 --> 00:17:59,930
That was good!

175
00:18:15,481 --> 00:18:18,007
Where are you going?
He went that way.

176
00:18:18,117 --> 00:18:20,108
Master, if we keep this chase
going any longer...

177
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,244
that creep is gonna
end up deep-fried...

178
00:18:22,355 --> 00:18:26,622
and, personally, I'd very much like to
find out who he is and who he's working for.

179
00:18:26,727 --> 00:18:29,423
This is a shortcut.
I think.

180
00:18:57,223 --> 00:18:59,488
Well, you've lost him.

181
00:18:59,593 --> 00:19:01,652
I'm deeply sorry, Master.

182
00:19:01,761 --> 00:19:03,662
That was some shortcut,
Anakin.

183
00:19:03,763 --> 00:19:06,198
He went completely
the other way.

184
00:19:06,298 --> 00:19:08,357
- Once again you've proved--
- If you'll excuse me.

185
00:19:10,903 --> 00:19:14,532
I hate it when he does that.

186
00:21:42,521 --> 00:21:44,285
Anakin!

187
00:21:44,391 --> 00:21:47,223
- She went into the club, Master.
- Patience.

188
00:21:47,326 --> 00:21:49,295
Use the Force. Think.

189
00:21:49,395 --> 00:21:52,297
- Sorry, Master.
- He went in there to hide, not to run.

190
00:21:52,398 --> 00:21:55,459
- Yes, Master.
- Next time, try not to lose it.

191
00:21:55,568 --> 00:21:58,298
- Yes, Master.
- This weapon is your life.

192
00:21:58,404 --> 00:22:00,669
I try, Master.

193
00:22:00,773 --> 00:22:03,674
Why do I get the feeling
you're going to be the death of me?

194
00:22:03,777 --> 00:22:07,508
Don't say that, Master. You're
the closest thing I have to a father.

195
00:22:07,614 --> 00:22:10,708
- Then why don't you listen to me?
- I am trying.

196
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:27,189
- Can you see him?
- I think he is a she...

197
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:30,497
and I think she
is a changeling.

198
00:22:30,604 --> 00:22:33,231
In that case,
be extra careful.

199
00:22:35,275 --> 00:22:37,709
- Go and find her.
- Where are you going, Master?

200
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:40,371
For a drink.

201
00:22:49,855 --> 00:22:52,551
Thank you.

202
00:22:52,659 --> 00:22:54,558
You wanna buy
some death sticks?

203
00:22:54,661 --> 00:22:56,560
You don't want to
sell me death sticks.

204
00:22:56,663 --> 00:22:59,290
- I don't want to sell you death sticks.
- You want to go home...

205
00:22:59,398 --> 00:23:02,299
- and rethink your life.
- I want to go home and rethink my life.

206
00:23:51,017 --> 00:23:54,316
Easy. Jedi business.
Go back to your drinks.

207
00:23:59,224 --> 00:24:02,955
- Do you know who it was
you were trying to kill?

208
00:24:03,063 --> 00:24:05,792
It was a senator from Naboo.

209
00:24:05,898 --> 00:24:07,798
And who hired you?

210
00:24:07,901 --> 00:24:09,835
It was just a job.

211
00:24:09,935 --> 00:24:12,165
Who hired you? Tell us.

212
00:24:13,673 --> 00:24:15,663
Tell us now!

213
00:24:16,875 --> 00:24:20,505
It was a bounty hunter called--

214
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:28,210
<i>Wee shahnit... sleemo.</i>

215
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:39,798
Toxic dart.

216
00:24:50,076 --> 00:24:54,136
Track down this bounty hunter
you must, Obi-Wan.

217
00:24:54,247 --> 00:24:57,682
Most importantly,
find out who he's working for.

218
00:24:57,784 --> 00:24:59,683
What about
Senator Amidala?

219
00:24:59,786 --> 00:25:01,685
She will still
need protecting.

220
00:25:01,788 --> 00:25:04,722
Handle that your Padawan will.

221
00:25:06,459 --> 00:25:10,122
Anakin, escort the senator back
to her home planet of Naboo.

222
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:13,961
She'll be safer there.
And don't use registered transport.

223
00:25:14,067 --> 00:25:16,035
Travel as refugees.

224
00:25:16,135 --> 00:25:19,037
As the leader of the opposition,
it will be very difficult...

225
00:25:19,138 --> 00:25:21,538
to get Senator Amidala
to leave the capital.

226
00:25:21,641 --> 00:25:24,336
<i>Until caught</i>
<i>this killer is...</i>

227
00:25:24,443 --> 00:25:28,106
our judgment she must respect.

228
00:25:28,213 --> 00:25:31,047
- Hmm.
- <i>Anakin, go to the senate...</i>

229
00:25:31,151 --> 00:25:34,347
and ask Chancellor Palpatine
to speak with her about this matter.

230
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:48,394
I will talk with her. Senator Amidala
will not refuse an executive order.

231
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,662
I know her well enough
to assure you of that.

232
00:25:50,769 --> 00:25:52,863
Thank you,
Your Excellency.

233
00:25:52,971 --> 00:25:56,338
And so, they've finally
given you an assignment.

234
00:25:57,477 --> 00:25:59,444
Your patience
has paid off.

235
00:25:59,546 --> 00:26:02,913
Your guidance
more than my patience.

236
00:26:03,016 --> 00:26:05,382
You don't
need guidance, Anakin.

237
00:26:06,719 --> 00:26:09,711
In time, you will learn
to trust your feelings.

238
00:26:11,657 --> 00:26:13,750
Then you will be invincible.

239
00:26:17,063 --> 00:26:21,659
I have said it many times: You are
the most gifted Jedi I have ever met.

240
00:26:21,768 --> 00:26:23,667
Thank you,
Your Excellency.

241
00:26:23,769 --> 00:26:27,467
I see you becoming
the greatest of all the Jedi, Anakin...

242
00:26:27,574 --> 00:26:30,098
even more powerful
than Master Yoda.

243
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,306
I am concerned
for my Padawan.

244
00:26:37,416 --> 00:26:40,146
He is not ready to be given
this assignment on his own yet.

245
00:26:40,252 --> 00:26:43,483
The council is confident
in its decision, Obi-Wan.

246
00:26:43,589 --> 00:26:45,557
The boy has exceptional skills.

247
00:26:45,657 --> 00:26:48,092
But he still has
much to learn, Master.

248
00:26:48,193 --> 00:26:51,652
His abilities have made him,
well, arrogant.

249
00:26:51,763 --> 00:26:53,731
Yes, yes.

250
00:26:53,833 --> 00:26:56,768
A flaw more and more
common among Jedi.

251
00:26:56,869 --> 00:26:58,769
Hmm.

252
00:26:58,872 --> 00:27:01,271
Too sure of themselves
they are.

253
00:27:01,374 --> 00:27:04,809
Even the older,
more experienced ones.

254
00:27:04,911 --> 00:27:08,471
Remember, Obi-Wan,
if the prophecy is true...

255
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:12,243
your apprentice is the only one who
can bring the Force back into balance.

256
00:27:16,355 --> 00:27:19,189
<i>I'm taking</i>
<i>an extended leave of absence.</i>

257
00:27:19,291 --> 00:27:22,420
<i>It will be your responsibility</i>
<i>to take my place in the senate.</i>

258
00:27:22,528 --> 00:27:25,430
- Representative Binks, I know I can count on you.
- Hmm?

259
00:27:25,531 --> 00:27:30,298
Mesa honored to be taking on
dissa heavy burden.

260
00:27:30,403 --> 00:27:34,669
Mesa accept this with muy, muy humility
and, uh--

261
00:27:34,773 --> 00:27:37,334
JarJar, I don't wish
to hold you up.

262
00:27:37,442 --> 00:27:39,433
I'm sure you have
a great deal to do.

263
00:27:39,546 --> 00:27:42,515
Of course.
Milady.

264
00:27:47,787 --> 00:27:49,686
I do not like
this idea of hiding.

265
00:27:49,788 --> 00:27:51,847
Don't worry.

266
00:27:51,958 --> 00:27:54,188
Now that the council
has ordered an investigation...

267
00:27:54,294 --> 00:27:56,990
it won't take Master Obi-Wan long
to find this bounty hunter.

268
00:27:57,096 --> 00:27:59,997
I haven't worked for a year to defeat
the Military Creation Act...

269
00:28:00,098 --> 00:28:02,328
to not be here when
its fate is decided.

270
00:28:02,434 --> 00:28:06,997
Sometimes we must let go of our pride
and do what is requested of us.

271
00:28:07,105 --> 00:28:09,539
Anakin,
you've grown up.

272
00:28:11,411 --> 00:28:13,641
Master Obi-Wan
manages not to see it.

273
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:25,248
Don't get me wrong.
Obi-Wan is a great mentor.

274
00:28:25,357 --> 00:28:27,917
As wise as Master Yoda and...

275
00:28:28,027 --> 00:28:30,119
as powerful as Master Windu.

276
00:28:32,498 --> 00:28:34,932
I am truly thankful
to be his apprentice.

277
00:28:37,103 --> 00:28:40,128
In some ways--
a lot of ways--

278
00:28:42,174 --> 00:28:44,143
I'm really ahead of him.

279
00:28:45,244 --> 00:28:47,736
I'm ready for the trials...

280
00:28:47,846 --> 00:28:50,280
<i>but he feels that</i>
<i>I'm too unpredictable.</i>

281
00:28:50,383 --> 00:28:52,282
<i>He won't let me move on.</i>

282
00:28:52,384 --> 00:28:55,411
- That must be frustrating.
- It's worse.

283
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,354
He's overly critical.
He never listens.

284
00:28:58,458 --> 00:29:00,789
He-- He doesn't understand.

285
00:29:00,893 --> 00:29:03,019
It's not fair!

286
00:29:03,128 --> 00:29:07,963
All mentors have a way of seeing
more of our faults than we would like.

287
00:29:08,067 --> 00:29:10,057
It's the only way we grow.

288
00:29:11,237 --> 00:29:13,204
I know.

289
00:29:14,539 --> 00:29:16,565
Anakin.

290
00:29:18,944 --> 00:29:21,435
Don't try to grow up too fast.

291
00:29:21,547 --> 00:29:23,480
But I am grown up.

292
00:29:25,684 --> 00:29:27,653
You said it yourself.

293
00:29:28,755 --> 00:29:30,882
Please don't look
at me like that.

294
00:29:32,125 --> 00:29:35,583
- Why not?
- It makes me feel uncomfortable.

295
00:29:37,596 --> 00:29:39,565
Sorry, milady.

296
00:29:54,846 --> 00:29:57,816
- Be safe, milady.
- Thank you, Captain.

297
00:29:57,916 --> 00:30:00,784
Take good care of Dormé.
The threat's on you two now.

298
00:30:00,886 --> 00:30:02,855
He'll be safe with me.

299
00:30:07,727 --> 00:30:10,820
- You'll be fine.
- It's not me, milady.

300
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:14,661
I worry about you. What if they
realize you've left the capital?

301
00:30:14,767 --> 00:30:19,135
Well, then my Jedi protector
will have to prove how good he is.

302
00:30:19,238 --> 00:30:21,137
Anakin.

303
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:24,334
Don't do anything without first
consulting either myself or the council.

304
00:30:24,443 --> 00:30:27,435
Yes, Master.

305
00:30:27,547 --> 00:30:30,071
I'll get to the bottom
of this plot quickly, milady.

306
00:30:30,182 --> 00:30:32,116
You'll be back here
in no time.

307
00:30:32,218 --> 00:30:35,449
I'll be most grateful for
your speed, Master Jedi.

308
00:30:35,555 --> 00:30:37,454
- It's time to go.
- I know.

309
00:30:37,557 --> 00:30:40,082
Anakin, may the Force
be with you.

310
00:30:40,192 --> 00:30:42,218
May the Force
be with you, Master.

311
00:30:53,705 --> 00:30:55,605
Suddenly I'm afraid.

312
00:30:55,708 --> 00:30:59,302
This is my first assignment
on my own. I am too.

313
00:31:01,413 --> 00:31:03,314
Don't worry.
We have R2 with us.

314
00:31:09,221 --> 00:31:12,384
I do hope he doesn't
try anything foolish.

315
00:31:12,491 --> 00:31:15,950
I'd be more concerned
about her doing something than him.

316
00:31:36,481 --> 00:31:38,847
Someone to see ya, honey!

317
00:31:39,951 --> 00:31:41,852
<i>Jedi, by the looks of him.</i>

318
00:31:42,954 --> 00:31:46,891
- Obi-Wan!
- Hello, Dex.

319
00:31:46,992 --> 00:31:49,586
Take a seat.
I'll be right with ya.

320
00:31:51,998 --> 00:31:54,967
- You wanna cup o'jawa juice?
- Oh, yes. Thank you.

321
00:31:58,471 --> 00:32:02,031
<i>Hey, old buddy!</i>

322
00:32:07,547 --> 00:32:11,074
Ohhh.

323
00:32:11,183 --> 00:32:14,517
So, my friend,
what can I do for ya?

324
00:32:14,619 --> 00:32:17,452
You can tell me
what this is.

325
00:32:17,557 --> 00:32:20,821
Well, whattaya know!

326
00:32:20,926 --> 00:32:23,292
I ain't seen one of these
since I was prospectin'...

327
00:32:23,395 --> 00:32:26,626
<i>on Subterrel,</i>
<i>beyond the outer rim.</i>

328
00:32:26,731 --> 00:32:29,200
Can you tell me
where it came from? Thank you.

329
00:32:29,301 --> 00:32:32,270
This baby
belongs to them cloners.

330
00:32:32,371 --> 00:32:36,671
What you got here
is a Kamino saberdart.

331
00:32:36,776 --> 00:32:39,768
I wonder why it didn't show up
in the analysis archives.

332
00:32:39,878 --> 00:32:43,177
It's these funny little cuts
on the side that give it away.

333
00:32:43,281 --> 00:32:47,218
Those analysis droids
only focus on symbols. Huh!

334
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:49,584
I should think that you Jedi
would have more respect...

335
00:32:49,689 --> 00:32:51,884
for the difference
between knowledge and...

336
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:54,824
wisdom.

337
00:32:54,926 --> 00:32:58,294
Well, if droids could think,
there'd be none of us here, would there?

338
00:32:59,865 --> 00:33:02,060
Kamino. I'm not familiar with it.
Is it in the Republic?

339
00:33:02,167 --> 00:33:04,135
No, no. It's beyond
the outer rim.

340
00:33:04,237 --> 00:33:07,832
I'd say about,
uh, 12 parsecs...

341
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,839
outside the Rishi Maze.

342
00:33:09,942 --> 00:33:12,876
Should be easy to find,
even for those droids in your archives.

343
00:33:15,448 --> 00:33:20,214
These, uh, Kaminoans
keep to themselves.

344
00:33:20,318 --> 00:33:23,185
They're cloners.
Damn good ones too.

345
00:33:24,356 --> 00:33:27,758
- Cloners. Are they friendly?
- Oh, depends.

346
00:33:27,859 --> 00:33:29,794
Depends on what, Dex?

347
00:33:29,895 --> 00:33:32,762
On how good
your manners are...

348
00:33:32,865 --> 00:33:35,128
and how big your, uh...

349
00:33:35,233 --> 00:33:38,202
pocketbook is.

350
00:33:41,673 --> 00:33:43,574
Hmm.

351
00:33:46,945 --> 00:33:49,073
Did you call
for assistance?

352
00:33:49,181 --> 00:33:52,844
- Yes, yes, I did.
- Are you having a problem, Master Kenobi?

353
00:33:52,951 --> 00:33:56,250
Yes, um, I'm looking for
a planetary system called Kamino.

354
00:33:56,355 --> 00:33:58,618
- Kamino.
- It doesn't show up on the archive charts.

355
00:33:58,723 --> 00:34:03,023
Kamino. It's not a system
I'm familiar with.

356
00:34:03,128 --> 00:34:05,494
Are you sure you have
the right coordinates?

357
00:34:05,597 --> 00:34:08,590
According to my information, it should
appear in this quadrant here...

358
00:34:08,701 --> 00:34:10,760
just south
of the Rishi Maze.

359
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:21,043
I hate to say it, but it looks like
the system you're searching for...

360
00:34:21,146 --> 00:34:23,047
doesn't exist.

361
00:34:23,148 --> 00:34:26,414
Impossible. Perhaps the archives
are incomplete.

362
00:34:26,518 --> 00:34:29,579
If an item does not appear
in our records...

363
00:34:29,688 --> 00:34:31,782
it does not exist.

364
00:34:53,545 --> 00:34:56,070
Hey, you! No droids!

365
00:34:56,181 --> 00:34:59,378
Get outta here!

366
00:35:03,688 --> 00:35:05,884
Thank you, R2.

367
00:35:05,992 --> 00:35:10,485
- Must be difficult, having
sworn your life to the Jedi...

368
00:35:10,596 --> 00:35:14,498
not being able to visit the places
you like or do the things you like.

369
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:16,726
Or be with the people
that I love.

370
00:35:16,835 --> 00:35:19,463
Are you allowed to love?

371
00:35:19,572 --> 00:35:21,630
I thought that was
forbidden for a Jedi.

372
00:35:25,177 --> 00:35:27,474
Attachment is forbidden.

373
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,181
Possession is forbidden.

374
00:35:31,282 --> 00:35:34,844
Compassion, which I would define
as unconditional love...

375
00:35:34,954 --> 00:35:37,422
is central
to a Jedi's life.

376
00:35:39,891 --> 00:35:44,260
So you might say that
we are encouraged to love.

377
00:35:44,362 --> 00:35:48,958
- You've changed so much.
- Ah, you haven't changed a bit.

378
00:35:49,068 --> 00:35:51,900
You're exactly the way
I remember you in my dreams.

379
00:36:04,583 --> 00:36:08,313
<i>Reach out.</i>
<i>Sense the Force around you.</i>

380
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:11,117
Use your feelings
you must.

381
00:36:15,527 --> 00:36:18,519
Younglings.
Younglings!

382
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:21,065
A visitor
we have.

383
00:36:21,166 --> 00:36:24,068
Hello, Master Obi-Wan.

384
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:27,230
Hello. I'm sorry
to disturb you, Master.

385
00:36:27,338 --> 00:36:31,036
What help can I be,
Obi-Wan? Hmm?

386
00:36:31,143 --> 00:36:34,043
I'm looking for a planet
described to me by an old friend.

387
00:36:34,146 --> 00:36:37,309
I trust him, but the systems
don't show on the archive maps.

388
00:36:37,416 --> 00:36:41,715
Mmm. Lost a planet
Master Obi-Wan has.

389
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,721
How embarrassing.

390
00:36:43,822 --> 00:36:46,451
How embarrassing.

391
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:49,255
Hmm?
Liam, the shades.

392
00:36:50,628 --> 00:36:53,097
Gather round
the map reader.

393
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:55,360
<i>Clear your minds...</i>

394
00:36:55,467 --> 00:36:58,925
and find Obi-Wan's
wayward planet we will.

395
00:37:00,139 --> 00:37:03,302
It ought to be... here...

396
00:37:03,409 --> 00:37:05,309
but it isn't.

397
00:37:05,411 --> 00:37:08,847
Gravity is pulling all the stars
in the area towards this spot.

398
00:37:08,947 --> 00:37:12,543
Hmm. Gravity's
silhouette remains...

399
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:15,619
but the star
and all the planets...

400
00:37:15,721 --> 00:37:17,711
disappeared they have.

401
00:37:17,822 --> 00:37:19,847
How can this be?

402
00:37:19,958 --> 00:37:22,119
Hmm? A thought?

403
00:37:23,695 --> 00:37:27,461
- <i>Anyone.</i>
- <i>Master?</i>

404
00:37:27,565 --> 00:37:30,467
Because someone erased it
from the archive memory.

405
00:37:33,806 --> 00:37:37,936
Truly wonderful
the mind of a child is.

406
00:37:40,612 --> 00:37:42,807
The Padawan is right.

407
00:37:42,914 --> 00:37:45,974
<i>Go to the center</i>
<i>of gravity's pull...</i>

408
00:37:46,085 --> 00:37:49,577
and find your planet
you will.

409
00:37:53,858 --> 00:37:58,295
Hmm. The data
must have been erased.

410
00:37:58,396 --> 00:38:01,161
But, Master Yoda, who could
empty information from the archives?

411
00:38:01,266 --> 00:38:03,166
That's impossible, isn't it?

412
00:38:03,268 --> 00:38:06,670
Dangerous and disturbing
this puzzle is.

413
00:38:06,771 --> 00:38:11,141
Only a Jedi
could have erased those files.

414
00:38:11,242 --> 00:38:14,679
But who and why,
harder to answer.

415
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:19,307
Meditate on this I will. Hmm.

416
00:38:43,442 --> 00:38:45,773
I wasn't the youngest queen
ever elected...

417
00:38:45,878 --> 00:38:49,472
but now that I think back on it,
I'm not sure I was old enough.

418
00:38:49,581 --> 00:38:51,550
I'm not sure
I was ready.

419
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:54,847
The people you served
thought you did a good job.

420
00:38:54,954 --> 00:38:58,617
I heard they even tried to amend the
constitution so you could stay in office.

421
00:38:58,724 --> 00:39:01,385
I was relieved when
my two terms were up.

422
00:39:01,492 --> 00:39:05,190
But when the queen asked me
to serve as senator...

423
00:39:05,297 --> 00:39:07,492
I couldn't refuse her.

424
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:10,932
I agree with her.
I think the Republic needs you.

425
00:39:13,072 --> 00:39:15,199
I'm glad that you
chose to serve.

426
00:39:22,213 --> 00:39:24,148
If the senate
votes to create an army...

427
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:27,708
- I'm sure it's going to push us into a civil war.
- It's unthinkable.

428
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:31,221
There hasn't been a full-scale war
since the formation of the Republic.

429
00:39:31,322 --> 00:39:33,813
Do you see any way
through negotiations...

430
00:39:33,925 --> 00:39:36,018
to bring the separatists
back into the Republic?

431
00:39:36,128 --> 00:39:38,322
Not if they feel threatened.

432
00:39:38,429 --> 00:39:41,797
My guess is they'll turn to the Trade
Federations or the Commerce Guilds for help.

433
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:46,269
<i>It's outrageous, but after four trials</i>
<i>in the Supreme Court...</i>

434
00:39:46,371 --> 00:39:50,172
Nute Gunray is still the viceroy
of the Trade Federation.

435
00:39:50,275 --> 00:39:54,268
<i>I fear the senate is powerless</i>
<i>to resolve this crisis.</i>

436
00:39:56,414 --> 00:39:58,576
We must keep our faith
in the Republic.

437
00:40:04,623 --> 00:40:09,525
The day we stop believing democracy
can work is the day we lose it.

438
00:40:09,628 --> 00:40:12,324
Let's pray that day
never comes.

439
00:40:12,431 --> 00:40:15,092
In the meantime,
we must consider your own safety.

440
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:18,192
What is your suggestion,
Master Jedi?

441
00:40:18,304 --> 00:40:20,204
Oh, Anakin's
not a Jedi yet.

442
00:40:20,306 --> 00:40:22,331
He's still a Padawan learner.
But I was thinking--

443
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:25,001
- Hold on a minute.
- Excuse me.

444
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:27,543
I was thinking I would stay
in the lake country.

445
00:40:27,646 --> 00:40:29,876
There are some places up there
that are very isolated.

446
00:40:29,981 --> 00:40:33,041
Excuse me. I'm in charge
of security here, milady.

447
00:40:33,152 --> 00:40:36,780
And this is my home. I know it
very well. That is why we're here.

448
00:40:36,889 --> 00:40:41,382
<i>I think it would be wise if you took
advantage of my knowledge in this instance.</i>

449
00:40:42,728 --> 00:40:44,661
Sorry, milady.

450
00:40:47,865 --> 00:40:49,992
Perfect. It's settled, then.

451
00:41:03,983 --> 00:41:08,646
There it is, R4, right where it
should be. Our missing planet Kamino.

452
00:41:46,824 --> 00:41:49,692
Master Jedi.

453
00:41:49,795 --> 00:41:52,161
The prime minister
is expecting you.

454
00:41:53,398 --> 00:41:55,798
- I'm expected?
- Of course.

455
00:41:56,835 --> 00:41:58,961
He is anxious
to meet you.

456
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:01,231
<i>After all these years...</i>

457
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:04,969
we were beginning to think
you weren't coming.

458
00:42:05,077 --> 00:42:07,271
Now, please, this way.

459
00:42:20,092 --> 00:42:22,559
May I present Lama Su...

460
00:42:22,661 --> 00:42:24,719
prime minister of Kamino.

461
00:42:26,465 --> 00:42:28,659
And this is Master Jedi--

462
00:42:28,766 --> 00:42:30,666
Obi-Wan Kenobi.

463
00:42:30,768 --> 00:42:34,068
I trust you're going
to enjoy your stay.

464
00:42:35,507 --> 00:42:37,474
Please.

465
00:42:39,143 --> 00:42:41,338
And now to business.

466
00:42:41,447 --> 00:42:45,382
You will be delighted
to hear that we are on schedule.

467
00:42:46,485 --> 00:42:48,385
<i>200,000 units</i>
<i>are ready...</i>

468
00:42:48,487 --> 00:42:50,853
with a million more
well on the way.

469
00:42:51,989 --> 00:42:53,923
That's good news.

470
00:42:54,025 --> 00:42:57,188
Please tell
your Master Sifo-Dyas...

471
00:42:57,295 --> 00:43:00,628
that his order
will be met on time.

472
00:43:00,731 --> 00:43:02,722
I'm sorry. Master--

473
00:43:02,835 --> 00:43:07,704
Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas is still
a leading member of the Jedi Council...

474
00:43:07,806 --> 00:43:09,706
is he not?

475
00:43:09,807 --> 00:43:13,608
Master Sifo-Dyas was killed
almost ten years ago.

476
00:43:13,711 --> 00:43:17,579
Oh, I'm so sorry
to hear that.

477
00:43:17,682 --> 00:43:21,949
But I'm sure he would have been proud
of the army we've built for him.

478
00:43:23,054 --> 00:43:25,717
- The army?
- Yes.

479
00:43:25,824 --> 00:43:30,487
A clone army, and I must say,
one of the finest we've ever created.

480
00:43:30,596 --> 00:43:32,586
Tell me, Prime Minister...

481
00:43:32,697 --> 00:43:35,188
when my master
first contacted you about the army...

482
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:37,427
did-- did he say
who it was for?

483
00:43:37,536 --> 00:43:39,561
Of course he did.

484
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:42,333
This army
is for the Republic.

485
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:46,809
<i>But you must be anxious</i>
<i>to inspect the units for yourself.</i>

486
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:50,438
That's why I'm here.

487
00:44:11,302 --> 00:44:13,396
We used to come here
for school retreat.

488
00:44:15,173 --> 00:44:17,266
We would swim
to that island every day.

489
00:44:18,577 --> 00:44:20,545
I love the water.

490
00:44:25,284 --> 00:44:29,311
We used to lie out on the sand
and let the sun dry us...

491
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:32,389
and try to guess the names
of the birds singing.

492
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:37,956
I don't like sand.

493
00:44:38,063 --> 00:44:42,021
It's coarse and rough
and irritating...

494
00:44:42,134 --> 00:44:44,101
and it gets everywhere.

495
00:44:46,304 --> 00:44:48,898
Not like here.

496
00:44:49,007 --> 00:44:50,974
Here, everything is soft...

497
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:55,271
and smooth.

498
00:45:31,882 --> 00:45:34,112
No.

499
00:45:34,219 --> 00:45:36,244
I shouldn't have done that.

500
00:45:37,989 --> 00:45:39,958
I'm sorry.

501
00:45:53,838 --> 00:45:57,434
- Very impressive.
- I'd hoped you would be pleased.

502
00:46:00,579 --> 00:46:03,070
<i>Clones can think creatively.</i>

503
00:46:03,181 --> 00:46:07,083
<i>You will find that they are</i>
<i>immensely superior to droids.</i>

504
00:46:11,056 --> 00:46:16,255
We take great pride in our combat
education and training programs.

505
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:19,728
This group was created
about five years ago.

506
00:46:19,831 --> 00:46:21,889
<i>You mentioned</i>
<i>growth acceleration.</i>

507
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,934
<i>Oh, yes, it's essential.</i>

508
00:46:24,036 --> 00:46:27,061
<i>Otherwise, a mature clone</i>
<i>would take a lifetime to grow.</i>

509
00:46:27,172 --> 00:46:29,766
<i>Now we can do it</i>
<i>in half the time.</i>

510
00:46:29,875 --> 00:46:32,536
<i>I see.</i>

511
00:46:32,643 --> 00:46:34,543
<i>They are totally obedient...</i>

512
00:46:34,646 --> 00:46:37,342
<i>taking any order</i>
<i>without question.</i>

513
00:46:37,449 --> 00:46:39,507
<i>We modified</i>
<i>their genetic structure...</i>

514
00:46:39,617 --> 00:46:42,815
<i>to make them less independent</i>
<i>than the original host.</i>

515
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:45,481
And who was
the original host?

516
00:46:45,590 --> 00:46:47,682
A bounty hunter
called Jango Fett.

517
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:51,387
And where is
this bounty hunter now?

518
00:46:51,496 --> 00:46:53,623
Oh, we keep him here.

519
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:59,134
<i>Apart from his pay,</i>
<i>which is considerable...</i>

520
00:46:59,237 --> 00:47:01,728
Fett demanded
only one thing:

521
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:04,434
an unaltered clone
for himself.

522
00:47:04,543 --> 00:47:06,976
- Curious, isn't it?
- "Unaltered"?

523
00:47:07,079 --> 00:47:09,603
Pure genetic replication.

524
00:47:09,715 --> 00:47:12,878
No tampering with the structure
to make it more docile...

525
00:47:12,983 --> 00:47:15,509
<i>and no growth acceleration.</i>

526
00:47:15,619 --> 00:47:18,918
I should very much like
to meet this Jango Fett.

527
00:47:19,023 --> 00:47:22,255
I would be very happy
to arrange it for you.

528
00:47:39,844 --> 00:47:42,677
Magnificent, aren't they?

529
00:47:48,786 --> 00:47:51,755
I don't know.

530
00:47:51,856 --> 00:47:54,018
Sure you do.
You just don't want to tell me.

531
00:47:54,126 --> 00:47:56,492
You gonna use one of
your Jedi mind tricks on me?

532
00:47:56,594 --> 00:47:58,688
They only work
on the weak-minded.

533
00:48:00,264 --> 00:48:03,291
All right.
I was 12.

534
00:48:03,402 --> 00:48:06,632
His name was Palo. We were both
in the Legislative Youth Program.

535
00:48:06,737 --> 00:48:09,797
He was a few years older than I.
Very cute.

536
00:48:09,907 --> 00:48:12,273
Dark, curly hair.
Dreamy eyes.

537
00:48:12,376 --> 00:48:14,641
All right, I get the picture.

538
00:48:14,746 --> 00:48:16,646
Whatever happened to him?

539
00:48:16,748 --> 00:48:19,717
I went into public service;
he went on to become an artist.

540
00:48:19,818 --> 00:48:24,016
- Maybe he was the smart one.
- You really don't like politicians, do you?

541
00:48:24,121 --> 00:48:26,282
I like two or three...

542
00:48:26,391 --> 00:48:28,449
but I'm not really sure
about one of them.

543
00:48:32,463 --> 00:48:34,762
I don't think
the system works.

544
00:48:34,865 --> 00:48:37,766
How would you
have it work?

545
00:48:37,869 --> 00:48:42,329
We need a system where the politicians
sit down and discuss the problem...

546
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:46,467
agree what's in the best interest
of all the people, and then do it.

547
00:48:46,577 --> 00:48:48,512
That's exactly
what we do.

548
00:48:48,612 --> 00:48:50,603
The trouble is that people
don't always agree.

549
00:48:50,715 --> 00:48:52,614
Well, then they
should be made to.

550
00:48:52,717 --> 00:48:56,619
- By whom? Who's gonna make them? You?
- I don't know. Someone.

551
00:48:56,721 --> 00:48:59,052
- Of course not me.
- But someone.

552
00:48:59,157 --> 00:49:01,056
Someone wise.

553
00:49:01,159 --> 00:49:04,958
Sounds an awful lot like
a dictatorship to me.

554
00:49:06,465 --> 00:49:08,695
Well, if it works.

555
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:17,601
- You're making fun of me.
- No.

556
00:49:17,708 --> 00:49:20,268
I'd be much too frightened
to tease a senator.

557
00:49:40,865 --> 00:49:43,766
<i>Whoa, whoa!</i>

558
00:49:44,902 --> 00:49:48,463
Oh, whoa!

559
00:49:59,317 --> 00:50:02,945
Ani! Ani, are you all right?

560
00:50:38,155 --> 00:50:41,215
Boba, is your father here?

561
00:50:41,326 --> 00:50:43,260
Yep.

562
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:45,420
May we see him?

563
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:48,362
Sure.

564
00:50:49,967 --> 00:50:52,094
Dad, Taun We's here.

565
00:51:05,282 --> 00:51:07,978
Jango, welcome back.

566
00:51:08,085 --> 00:51:10,019
<i>Was your trip productive?</i>

567
00:51:10,121 --> 00:51:12,054
Fairly.

568
00:51:12,157 --> 00:51:15,990
This is Jedi Master
Obi-Wan Kenobi.

569
00:51:16,094 --> 00:51:19,119
He's come to check
on our progress.

570
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:22,097
Your clones are very impressive.
You must be very proud.

571
00:51:22,199 --> 00:51:25,226
I'm just a simple man
trying to make my way in the universe.

572
00:51:25,336 --> 00:51:29,034
Ever made your way as far into
the interior as Coruscant?

573
00:51:29,139 --> 00:51:32,041
- Once or twice.
- Recently?

574
00:51:33,344 --> 00:51:35,813
Possibly.

575
00:51:35,914 --> 00:51:38,074
Then you must know
Master Sifo-Dyas.

576
00:51:42,686 --> 00:51:44,677
Uh, Boba,
<i>rood eht so-heeck.</i>

577
00:51:46,423 --> 00:51:49,257
Master who?

578
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:51,385
<i>Sifo-Dyas.</i>

579
00:51:51,496 --> 00:51:54,123
<i>Is he not the Jedi</i>
<i>who hired you for this job?</i>

580
00:51:57,068 --> 00:51:58,967
Never heard of him.

581
00:52:02,039 --> 00:52:04,007
Really?

582
00:52:04,108 --> 00:52:08,273
I was recruited by a man called Tyranus
on one of the moons of Bogden.

583
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:10,574
Curious.

584
00:52:13,851 --> 00:52:16,786
Do you like your army?

585
00:52:16,887 --> 00:52:18,856
I look forward
to seeing them in action.

586
00:52:20,257 --> 00:52:23,489
They'll do their job well.
I'll guarantee that.

587
00:52:23,594 --> 00:52:25,755
Thank you for
your time, Jango.

588
00:52:27,532 --> 00:52:29,625
Always a pleasure
to meet a Jedi.

589
00:52:48,286 --> 00:52:50,253
What is it, Dad?

590
00:52:52,623 --> 00:52:54,648
Pack your things.
We're leaving.

591
00:52:59,396 --> 00:53:03,891
And when I got to them, we went into
aggressive negotiations. Thank you.

592
00:53:04,001 --> 00:53:06,061
"Aggressive negotiations"?
What's that?

593
00:53:06,170 --> 00:53:09,231
Uh, well, negotiations
with a lightsaber.

594
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:12,309
Oh.

595
00:53:22,619 --> 00:53:25,748
If Master Obi-Wan caught me
doing this, he'd be very grumpy.

596
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:57,315
From the moment
I met you...

597
00:53:58,456 --> 00:54:00,947
all those years ago...

598
00:54:01,059 --> 00:54:04,050
not a day has gone by
when I haven't thought of you.

599
00:54:06,797 --> 00:54:09,733
And now that
I'm with you again...

600
00:54:09,833 --> 00:54:11,927
I'm in agony.

601
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:19,208
The closer I get to you,
the worse it gets.

602
00:54:19,309 --> 00:54:21,744
The thought of
not being with you--

603
00:54:21,846 --> 00:54:23,905
I can't breathe.

604
00:54:28,853 --> 00:54:33,755
I'm haunted by the kiss
that you should never have given me.

605
00:54:33,858 --> 00:54:36,155
My heart is beating...

606
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:39,230
hoping that that kiss
will not become a scar.

607
00:54:41,398 --> 00:54:44,300
You are in my very soul...

608
00:54:44,402 --> 00:54:46,460
tormenting me.

609
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:52,431
What can I do?
I will do anything that you ask.

610
00:55:03,387 --> 00:55:06,983
If you are suffering
as much as I am, please, tell me.

611
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:10,760
I can't.

612
00:55:11,862 --> 00:55:14,922
We can't.
It's... just not possible.

613
00:55:15,032 --> 00:55:18,001
Anything is possible, Padmé.
Listen to me.

614
00:55:18,101 --> 00:55:20,695
No, you listen.

615
00:55:20,804 --> 00:55:24,400
We live in a real world.
Come back to it.

616
00:55:24,509 --> 00:55:28,172
You're studying to become a Jedi.
I'm-- I'm a senator.

617
00:55:30,514 --> 00:55:32,539
<i>If you follow your thoughts</i>
<i>through to conclusion...</i>

618
00:55:32,650 --> 00:55:35,141
it'll take us to a place
we cannot go...

619
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:38,650
regardless of the way
we feel about each other.

620
00:55:38,755 --> 00:55:40,780
Then you do feel something.

621
00:55:40,891 --> 00:55:43,918
I will not let you
give up your future for me.

622
00:55:44,027 --> 00:55:46,188
You are asking me
to be rational.

623
00:55:47,331 --> 00:55:49,561
That is something
I know I cannot do.

624
00:55:49,666 --> 00:55:54,570
Believe me, I wish that I could
just wish away my feelings...

625
00:55:54,672 --> 00:55:57,300
but I can't.

626
00:55:57,407 --> 00:56:00,137
I will not give in to this.

627
00:56:07,251 --> 00:56:09,481
Well, you know, it...

628
00:56:09,586 --> 00:56:12,385
wouldn't have to
be that way.

629
00:56:12,489 --> 00:56:15,356
We could keep it a secret.

630
00:56:16,793 --> 00:56:18,784
We'd be living a lie...

631
00:56:18,896 --> 00:56:21,195
one we couldn't keep
even if we wanted to.

632
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:24,563
I couldn't do that.

633
00:56:24,668 --> 00:56:27,570
Could you, Anakin?
Could you live like that?

634
00:56:29,507 --> 00:56:32,532
No. You're right.

635
00:56:34,012 --> 00:56:35,980
It would destroy us.

636
00:56:43,487 --> 00:56:47,686
Tell your council that
the first battalions are ready.

637
00:56:47,791 --> 00:56:50,885
And remind them,
if they need more troops...

638
00:56:50,994 --> 00:56:54,123
it will take more time
to grow them.

639
00:56:54,231 --> 00:56:57,929
- I won't forget, and thank you.
- <i>Thank you.</i>

640
00:57:13,784 --> 00:57:16,048
R4!

641
00:57:16,153 --> 00:57:19,782
Scramble code five to Coruscant,
care of the old folks' home!

642
00:57:26,364 --> 00:57:29,663
I have successfully made contact
with the prime minister of Kamino.

643
00:57:29,766 --> 00:57:33,668
They are using a bounty hunter named
Jango Fett to create a clone army.

644
00:57:33,771 --> 00:57:36,262
I have a strong feeling
that this bounty hunter...

645
00:57:36,373 --> 00:57:38,467
is the assassin
we are looking for.

646
00:57:38,576 --> 00:57:42,739
Do you think these cloners are involved
in the plot to assassinate Senator Amidala?

647
00:57:42,847 --> 00:57:45,748
No, Master.
There appears to be no motive.

648
00:57:45,849 --> 00:57:48,751
<i>Do not assume</i>
<i>anything, Obi-Wan.</i>

649
00:57:48,853 --> 00:57:51,844
Clear your mind must be...

650
00:57:51,956 --> 00:57:56,119
if you are to discover
the real villains behind this plot.

651
00:57:56,226 --> 00:57:58,126
Yes, Master.

652
00:57:58,228 --> 00:58:01,255
They say Master Sifo-Dyas
placed an order for a clone army...

653
00:58:01,365 --> 00:58:04,960
<i>at the request of the senate</i>
<i>almost ten years ago.</i>

654
00:58:06,971 --> 00:58:10,668
I was under the impression
he was killed before that.

655
00:58:10,775 --> 00:58:14,302
Did the council ever authorize
the creation of a clone army?

656
00:58:14,411 --> 00:58:18,677
No. Whoever placed that order did not
have the authorization of the Jedi Council.

657
00:58:18,782 --> 00:58:22,411
Bring him here.
Question him we will.

658
00:58:23,755 --> 00:58:26,655
Yes, Master.
I will report back when I have him.

659
00:58:28,358 --> 00:58:32,159
Blind we are if creation
of this clone army...

660
00:58:32,262 --> 00:58:34,163
we could not see.

661
00:58:37,735 --> 00:58:39,793
I think it is time
we informed the senate...

662
00:58:39,903 --> 00:58:42,873
that our ability to use
the Force has diminished.

663
00:58:42,974 --> 00:58:47,103
Only the dark lord of the Sith
knows of our weakness.

664
00:58:47,210 --> 00:58:49,474
If informed the senate is...

665
00:58:49,579 --> 00:58:52,047
multiply our adversaries will.

666
00:58:53,650 --> 00:58:56,050
No.

667
00:58:56,153 --> 00:58:58,644
No.

668
00:58:58,755 --> 00:59:00,724
Mom, no.

669
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:04,920
Don't. No.

670
00:59:08,166 --> 00:59:10,134
No.

671
00:59:29,487 --> 00:59:31,545
Don't go.

672
00:59:33,590 --> 00:59:35,559
I don't want to disturb you.

673
00:59:36,893 --> 00:59:38,862
Your presence is soothing.

674
00:59:41,766 --> 00:59:43,824
You had another nightmare
last night.

675
00:59:45,036 --> 00:59:47,869
Jedi don't have nightmares.

676
00:59:47,972 --> 00:59:49,963
I heard you.

677
00:59:54,911 --> 00:59:56,902
I saw my mother.

678
00:59:59,884 --> 01:00:01,976
She is suffering, Padmé.

679
01:00:04,454 --> 01:00:07,652
I saw her as clearly
as I see you now.

680
01:00:18,101 --> 01:00:20,126
<i>She is in pain.</i>

681
01:00:22,606 --> 01:00:25,974
I know I'm disobeying my mandate
to protect you, Senator...

682
01:00:26,077 --> 01:00:28,101
<i>but I have to go.</i>

683
01:00:31,047 --> 01:00:33,039
I have to help her.

684
01:00:34,784 --> 01:00:36,684
I'll go with you.

685
01:00:36,786 --> 01:00:39,085
I'm sorry.
I don't have a choice.

686
01:00:50,134 --> 01:00:52,364
Dad, look!

687
01:00:52,469 --> 01:00:55,097
Boba, get on board!

688
01:02:10,181 --> 01:02:13,081
Oh, not good.

689
01:04:23,012 --> 01:04:25,208
- Wait right there.
- <i>Okey-okey.</i>

690
01:04:26,317 --> 01:04:28,842
<i>Da wanga!</i>

691
01:04:28,952 --> 01:04:31,820
<i>Chut-chut</i>, Watto.

692
01:04:31,922 --> 01:04:34,516
Let me help you with that.

693
01:04:35,626 --> 01:04:38,992
What? What do you want?

694
01:04:39,096 --> 01:04:41,563
Wait! You're a Jedi!

695
01:04:41,664 --> 01:04:44,862
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.

696
01:04:44,969 --> 01:04:48,028
<i>Ai!</i>

697
01:04:50,574 --> 01:04:52,735
I'm looking for Shmi Skywalker.

698
01:04:54,311 --> 01:04:56,541
Ani?

699
01:04:58,882 --> 01:05:00,851
Little Ani?

700
01:05:03,788 --> 01:05:05,914
Nahhh.

701
01:05:07,525 --> 01:05:11,552
You are Ani! It is you!

702
01:05:11,661 --> 01:05:15,655
You sure sprouted, huh?
<i>Wee-hoo!</i>

703
01:05:15,766 --> 01:05:19,532
A Jedi! Whattaya know!

704
01:05:19,637 --> 01:05:25,438
Hey... maybe you could help with some
deadbeats who owe me a lot of money.

705
01:05:25,543 --> 01:05:27,032
My mother.

706
01:05:27,143 --> 01:05:29,976
Oh, yeah. Shmi.

707
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:34,311
Uh... she's not mine-a
no more-a. I sold her.

708
01:05:34,418 --> 01:05:36,750
- You sold her?
- <i>Years ago.</i>

709
01:05:36,853 --> 01:05:40,983
Sorry, Ani, but you know,
business is business, huh?

710
01:05:41,090 --> 01:05:44,856
Yeah, I sold her to
a moisture farmer named, uh, Lars.

711
01:05:44,961 --> 01:05:46,952
At least I think
it was Lars.

712
01:05:47,063 --> 01:05:50,590
Believe it or not, I heard
he freed her and married her!

713
01:05:50,701 --> 01:05:54,101
<i>Can ya beat that, eh?</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

714
01:05:55,639 --> 01:05:57,572
Do you know
where they are now?

715
01:05:57,675 --> 01:06:00,576
Ooh, long way
from here.

716
01:06:00,677 --> 01:06:05,137
Someplace over on the other side
of Mos Eisley, I think, mmm.

717
01:06:05,248 --> 01:06:07,273
I'd like to know.

718
01:06:08,952 --> 01:06:11,682
Eh, sure. Absolutely!

719
01:06:11,789 --> 01:06:14,724
Let's go
look at my records, huh?

720
01:06:14,824 --> 01:06:17,349
Mmm.

721
01:06:41,731 --> 01:06:44,360
<i>Dad!</i>

722
01:06:44,467 --> 01:06:46,367
I think we're being tracked!

723
01:06:46,469 --> 01:06:49,905
<i>He must have put</i>
<i>a homing device on our hull.</i>

724
01:06:50,007 --> 01:06:52,271
Hang on, son.
We'll move into the asteroid field...

725
01:06:52,376 --> 01:06:54,867
and we'll have a couple
of surprises for him.

726
01:07:06,222 --> 01:07:09,659
Seismic charges!
Stand by.

727
01:07:34,952 --> 01:07:37,648
He doesn't seem
to take a hint, this guy.

728
01:07:56,106 --> 01:07:57,505
Watch out!

729
01:08:15,992 --> 01:08:19,985
<i>Get him, Dad! Get him! Fire!</i>

730
01:08:21,899 --> 01:08:24,458
Oh, blast!
This is why I hate flying!

731
01:08:44,488 --> 01:08:48,150
- We got him!
- We'll just have to finish him.

732
01:09:13,387 --> 01:09:18,189
- R4, prepare to jettison
the spare part canisters.

733
01:09:20,962 --> 01:09:23,725
Fire them now!

734
01:09:34,975 --> 01:09:38,377
Well, we won't be seeing him again.

735
01:10:13,213 --> 01:10:16,911
- Well, R4, I think
we've waited long enough.

736
01:10:35,603 --> 01:10:39,436
<i>There's an unusual concentration</i>
<i>of Federation ships over there, R4.</i>

737
01:11:13,940 --> 01:11:16,932
Stay with the ship, R2.

738
01:11:30,957 --> 01:11:33,221
Oh! Um, uh, hello.

739
01:11:33,327 --> 01:11:36,023
How might I be of service?
I am C--

740
01:11:36,130 --> 01:11:39,759
- 3PO?
- Oh, um--

741
01:11:39,867 --> 01:11:41,766
The maker!

742
01:11:41,868 --> 01:11:45,100
Oh, Master Ani!
I knew you would return.

743
01:11:45,206 --> 01:11:47,935
I knew it!
And Miss Padmé. Oh, my.

744
01:11:48,042 --> 01:11:49,942
Hello, 3PO.

745
01:11:50,043 --> 01:11:53,945
Bless my circuits!
I'm so pleased to see you both.

746
01:11:54,047 --> 01:11:56,038
I've come to see my mother.

747
01:11:56,149 --> 01:11:59,881
Oh. Um, I think perhaps
we'd better go indoors.

748
01:12:02,823 --> 01:12:07,386
<i>Master Owen, might I present</i>
<i>two most important visitors.</i>

749
01:12:07,494 --> 01:12:09,792
I'm Anakin Skywalker.

750
01:12:11,032 --> 01:12:13,966
Owen Lars. Uh, this is
my girlfriend, Beru.

751
01:12:14,068 --> 01:12:17,195
- Hello.
- I'm Padmé.

752
01:12:17,305 --> 01:12:19,864
I guess
I'm your stepbrother.

753
01:12:19,974 --> 01:12:22,841
I had a feeling
you might show up someday.

754
01:12:24,045 --> 01:12:27,207
- Is my mother here?
- <i>No, she's not.</i>

755
01:12:28,416 --> 01:12:31,248
Cliegg Lars.
Shmi is my wife.

756
01:12:33,354 --> 01:12:36,380
<i>We should go inside.</i>
<i>We have a lot to talk about.</i>

757
01:12:43,997 --> 01:12:47,091
<i>It was just before dawn.</i>
<i>They came out of nowhere.</i>

758
01:12:47,201 --> 01:12:50,966
<i>A hunting party</i>
<i>of Tusken Raiders.</i>

759
01:12:51,072 --> 01:12:53,972
<i>Your mother had gone out early,</i>
<i>like she always did...</i>

760
01:12:54,074 --> 01:12:58,068
<i>to pick mushrooms</i>
<i>that grow on the vaporators.</i>

761
01:12:58,179 --> 01:13:01,739
From the tracks,
she was about halfway home...

762
01:13:01,849 --> 01:13:03,748
when they took her.

763
01:13:05,353 --> 01:13:07,287
Those Tuskens walk like men...

764
01:13:07,387 --> 01:13:12,121
but they're vicious,
mindless monsters.

765
01:13:13,961 --> 01:13:16,987
Thirty of us went out after her.
Four of us came back.

766
01:13:17,097 --> 01:13:22,091
<i>I'd be out there with them,</i>
<i>but after I lost my leg...</i>

767
01:13:22,203 --> 01:13:27,835
I just couldn't ride anymore
un-until I heal.

768
01:13:27,942 --> 01:13:30,671
<i>I don't want</i>
<i>to give up on her...</i>

769
01:13:30,778 --> 01:13:33,645
<i>but she's been gone a month.</i>

770
01:13:33,747 --> 01:13:36,774
There's little hope
she's lasted this long.

771
01:13:41,555 --> 01:13:43,921
Where are you going?

772
01:13:44,024 --> 01:13:46,050
To find my mother.

773
01:13:47,261 --> 01:13:50,127
Your mother's dead, son.
Accept it.

774
01:14:12,286 --> 01:14:15,278
<i>You're gonna have to stay here.</i>

775
01:14:15,389 --> 01:14:18,586
<i>These are good people, Padmé.</i>
<i>You'll be safe.</i>

776
01:14:18,693 --> 01:14:21,320
<i>Anakin--</i>

777
01:14:30,671 --> 01:14:32,662
I won't be long.

778
01:16:21,614 --> 01:16:23,640
We must persuade
the Commerce Guild...

779
01:16:23,751 --> 01:16:26,150
and the Corporate Alliance
to sign the treaty.

780
01:16:26,252 --> 01:16:29,711
<i>What about the senator</i>
<i>from Naboo?</i>

781
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:32,314
<i>Is she dead yet?</i>

782
01:16:32,426 --> 01:16:36,362
I am not signing your treaty
until I have her head on my desk.

783
01:16:36,463 --> 01:16:38,796
<i>I am a man of my word, Viceroy.</i>

784
01:16:38,899 --> 01:16:41,958
<i>With these new battle droids</i>
<i>we've built for you...</i>

785
01:16:42,069 --> 01:16:45,231
<i>you'll have the finest army</i>
<i>in the galaxy.</i>

786
01:16:56,149 --> 01:16:58,050
<i>As I explained to you earlier...</i>

787
01:16:58,152 --> 01:17:01,382
<i>I am quite convinced</i>
<i>that 10,000 more systems...</i>

788
01:17:01,488 --> 01:17:04,322
will rally to our cause
with your support, gentlemen.

789
01:17:04,425 --> 01:17:08,190
What you are proposing
could be construed as treason.

790
01:17:08,295 --> 01:17:10,661
The Techno Union army...

791
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:16,864
is at your disposal, Count.

792
01:17:16,970 --> 01:17:21,237
The Banking Clan
will sign your treaty.

793
01:17:21,341 --> 01:17:23,242
<i>Good. Very good.</i>

794
01:17:23,344 --> 01:17:28,042
Our friends from the Trade Federation
have pledged their support...

795
01:17:28,149 --> 01:17:30,743
and when their battle droids
are combined with yours...

796
01:17:30,850 --> 01:17:34,650
we shall have an army
greater than any in the galaxy.

797
01:17:34,755 --> 01:17:38,417
The Jedi
will be overwhelmed.

798
01:17:38,525 --> 01:17:42,326
The Republic will agree
to any demands we make.

799
01:18:41,188 --> 01:18:43,087
Mom.

800
01:18:43,189 --> 01:18:45,180
Mom? Mom?

801
01:18:47,595 --> 01:18:49,563
Ani?

802
01:18:50,831 --> 01:18:54,596
Ani? Is it you?

803
01:18:55,802 --> 01:18:59,500
I'm here, Mom.
You're safe.

804
01:18:59,606 --> 01:19:02,302
Ani?

805
01:19:03,476 --> 01:19:05,467
Ani?

806
01:19:05,578 --> 01:19:08,547
Oh, you look
so handsome.

807
01:19:11,985 --> 01:19:14,045
My son.

808
01:19:14,154 --> 01:19:16,952
Oh, my grown-up son.

809
01:19:18,492 --> 01:19:20,721
I'm so proud of you, Ani.

810
01:19:20,828 --> 01:19:22,761
I missed you.

811
01:19:25,532 --> 01:19:27,625
Now I am complete.

812
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:36,667
I love y--

813
01:19:37,877 --> 01:19:41,006
Stay with me, Mom.
Everything--

814
01:19:41,114 --> 01:19:43,173
I love--

815
01:19:44,717 --> 01:19:47,185
I-- I love--

816
01:20:44,610 --> 01:20:48,569
<i>Anakin! Anakin! No-o-o!</i>

817
01:21:09,435 --> 01:21:11,336
What is it?

818
01:21:11,438 --> 01:21:15,373
Pain, suffering...

819
01:21:15,475 --> 01:21:17,466
death I feel.

820
01:21:22,015 --> 01:21:25,144
<i>Something terrible</i>
<i>has happened.</i>

821
01:21:27,820 --> 01:21:32,724
Young Skywalker is in pain.
Terrible pain.

822
01:21:37,597 --> 01:21:41,261
The transmitter is working,
but we're not receiving a return signal.

823
01:21:41,368 --> 01:21:44,097
Coruscant's too far.
R4, can you boost the power?

824
01:21:44,203 --> 01:21:47,172
We'll have to try something else.

825
01:21:50,577 --> 01:21:54,979
Maybe we can contact Anakin
on Naboo. It's much closer.

826
01:21:57,150 --> 01:21:59,551
<i>Anakin?</i>
<i>Anakin, do you copy?</i>

827
01:21:59,653 --> 01:22:02,622
<i>This is Obi-Wan Kenobi.</i>
<i>Anakin?</i>

828
01:22:02,722 --> 01:22:04,657
<i>He's not on Naboo, R4.</i>

829
01:22:06,592 --> 01:22:08,787
I'm going to try
and widen the range.

830
01:22:12,198 --> 01:22:14,167
I do hope nothing's
happened to him.

831
01:22:21,641 --> 01:22:23,542
<i>That's Anakin's tracking signal,</i>
<i>all right...</i>

832
01:22:23,644 --> 01:22:26,112
but it's coming
from Tatooine.

833
01:22:27,713 --> 01:22:30,307
What in the blazes
is he doing there?

834
01:22:30,417 --> 01:22:32,317
I told him to stay on Naboo.

835
01:22:35,021 --> 01:22:37,582
We haven't got
much time.

836
01:22:37,690 --> 01:22:39,716
Anakin?
Anakin, do you copy?

837
01:22:39,827 --> 01:22:41,886
This is Obi-Wan Kenobi.

838
01:22:49,802 --> 01:22:53,704
Retransmit this message--

839
01:22:53,806 --> 01:22:56,435
Anakin, do you copy?
Anakin--

840
01:22:56,542 --> 01:22:58,943
My long-range--
has been knocked out.

841
01:22:59,046 --> 01:23:03,141
Retransmit this message to Coruscant.

842
01:23:45,926 --> 01:23:47,917
I brought you something.

843
01:23:48,028 --> 01:23:50,154
<i>Are you hungry?</i>

844
01:23:51,899 --> 01:23:53,867
The shifter broke.

845
01:23:55,735 --> 01:23:58,569
Life seems so much simpler
when you're fixing things.

846
01:24:01,007 --> 01:24:04,500
I'm good at fixing things.
Always was.

847
01:24:06,846 --> 01:24:08,814
But I couldn't--

848
01:24:12,819 --> 01:24:14,719
Why'd she have to die?

849
01:24:18,225 --> 01:24:20,318
Why couldn't I save her?

850
01:24:20,426 --> 01:24:22,485
I know I could have!

851
01:24:25,332 --> 01:24:27,856
Sometimes there are things
no one can fix.

852
01:24:29,536 --> 01:24:31,970
- You're not all-powerful, Ani.
- Well, I should be!

853
01:24:34,975 --> 01:24:37,204
Someday I will be.

854
01:24:37,310 --> 01:24:39,904
I will be
the most powerful Jedi ever!

855
01:24:41,614 --> 01:24:44,310
I promise you.

856
01:24:44,417 --> 01:24:46,783
I will even learn
to stop people from dying.

857
01:24:47,954 --> 01:24:50,445
Anakin.

858
01:24:50,556 --> 01:24:53,219
It's all Obi-Wan's fault!

859
01:24:53,327 --> 01:24:56,356
He's jealous!
He's holding me back!

860
01:25:01,068 --> 01:25:03,127
What's wrong, Ani?

861
01:25:08,609 --> 01:25:10,577
I--

862
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:15,847
I killed them.

863
01:25:17,583 --> 01:25:19,551
I killed them all.

864
01:25:21,387 --> 01:25:23,287
They're dead.

865
01:25:23,390 --> 01:25:25,483
Every single one of them.

866
01:25:27,627 --> 01:25:29,595
And not just the men...

867
01:25:31,631 --> 01:25:33,600
but the women...

868
01:25:33,699 --> 01:25:36,760
and the children too.

869
01:25:36,869 --> 01:25:41,068
<i>They're like animals,</i>
<i>and I slaughtered them like animals!</i>

870
01:25:42,708 --> 01:25:44,699
I hate them!

871
01:26:02,529 --> 01:26:04,520
To be angry
is to be human.

872
01:26:04,631 --> 01:26:06,530
I'm a Jedi.

873
01:26:07,634 --> 01:26:09,533
I know I'm better than this.

874
01:26:23,516 --> 01:26:28,351
<i>I know wherever you are</i>
<i>it's become a better place.</i>

875
01:26:28,454 --> 01:26:33,289
You were the most loving partner
a man could ever have.

876
01:26:36,229 --> 01:26:38,287
Good-bye, my darling wife.

877
01:26:42,301 --> 01:26:44,235
And thank you.

878
01:27:11,530 --> 01:27:13,795
I wasn't strong enough
to save you, Mom.

879
01:27:16,903 --> 01:27:19,302
<i>I wasn't strong enough.</i>

880
01:27:22,743 --> 01:27:26,109
But I promise
I won't fail again.

881
01:27:37,056 --> 01:27:39,115
I miss you...

882
01:27:40,493 --> 01:27:42,394
so much.

883
01:27:49,336 --> 01:27:52,032
R2? What are you
doing here?

884
01:27:54,940 --> 01:27:59,172
It seems that he is carrying a message
from an Obi-Wan Kenobi.

885
01:27:59,279 --> 01:28:02,612
Hmm. Master Ani, does that name
mean anything to you?

886
01:28:05,452 --> 01:28:07,920
Anakin, my long-range transmitter
has been knocked out.

887
01:28:08,020 --> 01:28:10,251
Retransmit this message
to Coruscant.

888
01:28:14,927 --> 01:28:16,987
I have tracked the bounty hunter,
Jango Fett...

889
01:28:17,096 --> 01:28:19,224
to the droid foundries
on Geonosis.

890
01:28:19,332 --> 01:28:22,994
The Trade Federation is to take
delivery of a droid army here...

891
01:28:23,103 --> 01:28:25,094
and it is clear
that Viceroy Gunray...

892
01:28:25,204 --> 01:28:28,697
is behind the assassination attempts
on Senator Amidala.

893
01:28:28,809 --> 01:28:30,970
The Commerce Guilds
and the Corporate Alliance...

894
01:28:31,077 --> 01:28:34,739
have both pledged their armies
to Count Dooku and are forming a--

895
01:28:34,847 --> 01:28:36,907
Wait. Wait.

896
01:28:47,726 --> 01:28:52,390
More happening on Geonosis, I feel,
than has been revealed.

897
01:28:52,498 --> 01:28:54,557
I agree.

898
01:28:54,667 --> 01:28:57,932
Anakin, we will deal
with Count Dooku.

899
01:28:58,037 --> 01:29:01,599
The most important thing for you
is to stay where you are.

900
01:29:01,707 --> 01:29:04,438
Protect the senator
at all costs.

901
01:29:04,543 --> 01:29:07,104
That is your first priority.

902
01:29:08,614 --> 01:29:10,582
Understood, Master.

903
01:29:10,684 --> 01:29:12,708
They'll never get there
in time to save him.

904
01:29:12,819 --> 01:29:15,878
They have to come halfway
across the galaxy. Look.

905
01:29:18,057 --> 01:29:20,150
Geonosis is
less than a parsec away.

906
01:29:20,260 --> 01:29:22,251
If he's still alive.

907
01:29:24,163 --> 01:29:26,792
Ani, are you just gonna sit here
and let him die?

908
01:29:26,899 --> 01:29:29,425
- He's your friend, your mentor. He's--
- He's like my father!

909
01:29:29,536 --> 01:29:34,302
But you heard Master Windu.
He gave me strict orders to stay here!

910
01:29:34,407 --> 01:29:37,671
He gave you strict orders
to protect me...

911
01:29:37,777 --> 01:29:41,234
and I'm going to help Obi-Wan.

912
01:29:41,347 --> 01:29:46,011
If you plan to protect me,
you'll just have to come along.

913
01:29:48,921 --> 01:29:52,118
I'm not worried, R2.
It's just I've never flown before.

914
01:30:01,568 --> 01:30:05,095
The Commerce Guilds are preparing
for war. There can be no doubt of that.

915
01:30:05,204 --> 01:30:07,435
Count Dooku
must have made a treaty with them.

916
01:30:07,541 --> 01:30:10,942
The debate is over.

917
01:30:11,043 --> 01:30:14,012
Now we need that clone army.

918
01:30:14,113 --> 01:30:17,082
Unfortunately,
the debate is not over.

919
01:30:17,182 --> 01:30:21,483
The senate will never approve the use
of clones before the separatists attack.

920
01:30:21,587 --> 01:30:23,488
This is a crisis.

921
01:30:23,590 --> 01:30:26,684
The senate must vote the chancellor
emergency powers.

922
01:30:26,792 --> 01:30:30,126
<i>He can then approve</i>
<i>the creation of an army.</i>

923
01:30:30,229 --> 01:30:35,064
But what senator would have the courage
to propose such a radical amendment?

924
01:30:35,167 --> 01:30:39,297
If only...
Senator Amidala were here.

925
01:30:41,041 --> 01:30:43,305
Mm.

926
01:31:00,659 --> 01:31:02,923
Traitor.

927
01:31:03,029 --> 01:31:06,362
Oh, no, my friend.
This is a mistake, a terrible mistake.

928
01:31:06,466 --> 01:31:08,365
They have gone too far.
This is madness.

929
01:31:08,467 --> 01:31:11,061
I thought you were
the leader here, Dooku.

930
01:31:11,171 --> 01:31:13,765
This had nothing to do with me,
I assure you.

931
01:31:13,872 --> 01:31:17,331
<i>I will petition immediately</i>
<i>to have you set free.</i>

932
01:31:17,444 --> 01:31:21,073
Well, I hope it doesn't take
too long. I have work to do.

933
01:31:21,180 --> 01:31:25,015
May I ask why a Jedi knight...

934
01:31:25,118 --> 01:31:27,551
is all the way out here
on Geonosis?

935
01:31:27,654 --> 01:31:30,555
I've been tracking a bounty hunter
named Jango Fett.

936
01:31:30,657 --> 01:31:32,556
Do you know him?

937
01:31:32,658 --> 01:31:35,219
There are no bounty hunters here
that I am aware of.

938
01:31:35,328 --> 01:31:37,296
The Geonosians
don't trust them.

939
01:31:37,396 --> 01:31:40,264
Who can blame them?
But he is here, I can assure you.

940
01:31:40,367 --> 01:31:46,135
It's a great pity that our paths
have never crossed before, Obi-Wan.

941
01:31:46,238 --> 01:31:48,672
Qui-Gon always spoke
very highly of you.

942
01:31:53,579 --> 01:31:55,604
I wish he were still alive.

943
01:31:57,082 --> 01:31:59,779
I could use his help right now.

944
01:32:00,886 --> 01:32:02,854
Qui-Gon Jinn
would never join you.

945
01:32:04,990 --> 01:32:07,823
Don't be so sure,
my young Jedi.

946
01:32:07,926 --> 01:32:10,487
You forget that he was once
my apprentice...

947
01:32:10,596 --> 01:32:12,622
just as you
were once his.

948
01:32:12,731 --> 01:32:14,824
He knew all about
the corruption in the senate...

949
01:32:14,934 --> 01:32:18,926
but he would never have gone along with
it if he had learned the truth as I have.

950
01:32:19,038 --> 01:32:21,506
- The truth?
- The truth.

951
01:32:28,213 --> 01:32:30,113
What if I told you
that the Republic...

952
01:32:30,216 --> 01:32:33,344
was now under the control
of the dark lord of the Sith?

953
01:32:33,453 --> 01:32:36,649
No, that's not possible.
The Jedi would be aware of it.

954
01:32:36,756 --> 01:32:42,057
The dark side of the Force
has clouded their vision, my friend.

955
01:32:42,162 --> 01:32:44,721
Hundreds of senators
are now under the influence...

956
01:32:44,831 --> 01:32:49,426
of a Sith lord
called Darth Sidious.

957
01:32:50,537 --> 01:32:52,436
I don't believe you.

958
01:32:52,538 --> 01:32:54,597
<i>The viceroy</i>
<i>of the Trade Federation...</i>

959
01:32:54,707 --> 01:32:58,667
<i>was once in league</i>
<i>with this Darth Sidious...</i>

960
01:32:58,778 --> 01:33:02,645
but he was betrayed
ten years ago by the dark lord.

961
01:33:02,748 --> 01:33:05,842
He came to me for help.
He told me everything.

962
01:33:07,886 --> 01:33:09,945
You must join me, Obi-Wan...

963
01:33:11,157 --> 01:33:15,115
and together
we will destroy the Sith!

964
01:33:16,863 --> 01:33:19,161
I will never join you, Dooku.

965
01:33:28,675 --> 01:33:31,576
It may be difficult
to secure your release.

966
01:33:39,418 --> 01:33:42,319
<i>It's-a clear</i>
<i>desa separatists made a pact...</i>

967
01:33:42,421 --> 01:33:45,050
<i>wesa desa</i>
<i>Federation du Trade.</i>

968
01:33:45,158 --> 01:33:49,492
<i>Senators, "dellow felagates":</i>

969
01:33:49,595 --> 01:33:53,588
<i>In response to this direct threat</i>
<i>to the Republic...</i>

970
01:33:53,699 --> 01:33:57,396
mesa propose
that the senate...

971
01:33:57,503 --> 01:34:01,167
give immediately
emergency powers...

972
01:34:01,274 --> 01:34:03,640
to the supreme chancellor.

973
01:34:06,145 --> 01:34:10,104
Palpatine! Palpatine! Palpatine!

974
01:34:13,185 --> 01:34:16,451
<i>Order! We shall have order!</i>

975
01:34:18,158 --> 01:34:21,490
It is with great reluctance...

976
01:34:21,594 --> 01:34:23,561
that I have agreed
to this calling.

977
01:34:25,030 --> 01:34:29,764
I love democracy.
I love the Republic.

978
01:34:29,868 --> 01:34:32,064
<i>The power you give me...</i>

979
01:34:32,171 --> 01:34:36,198
I will lay down
when this crisis has abated.

980
01:34:41,180 --> 01:34:45,981
And as my first act
with this new authority...

981
01:34:46,085 --> 01:34:50,488
I will create a grand army
of the Republic...

982
01:34:50,590 --> 01:34:54,390
to counter the increasing threats
of the separatists.

983
01:34:55,728 --> 01:34:57,627
It is done, then.

984
01:34:57,729 --> 01:35:00,289
Hmm.

985
01:35:02,902 --> 01:35:06,599
I will take what Jedi we have left
and go to Geonosis and help Obi-Wan.

986
01:35:06,706 --> 01:35:11,541
Visit I will
the cloners on Kamino, hmm...

987
01:35:11,644 --> 01:35:15,341
and see this army they have
created for the Republic.

988
01:35:36,135 --> 01:35:38,034
See those columns of steam
straight ahead?

989
01:35:38,136 --> 01:35:40,195
They're exhaust vents
of some type.

990
01:35:40,305 --> 01:35:43,036
That'll do.

991
01:35:51,384 --> 01:35:55,444
Look, whatever happens
out there, follow my lead.

992
01:35:55,555 --> 01:35:57,954
I'm not interested
in getting into a war here.

993
01:35:58,056 --> 01:35:59,957
As a member
of the senate...

994
01:36:00,059 --> 01:36:02,856
maybe I can find
a diplomatic solution to this mess.

995
01:36:02,962 --> 01:36:07,194
Don't worry. I've given up
trying to argue with you.

996
01:36:12,238 --> 01:36:15,469
My obtuse little friend,
if they had needed our help...

997
01:36:15,574 --> 01:36:17,475
they would have
asked for it, hmm?

998
01:36:17,577 --> 01:36:20,101
You obviously have a great deal
to learn about human behavior.

999
01:36:45,203 --> 01:36:47,694
For a mechanic...

1000
01:36:47,806 --> 01:36:49,774
you seem to do
an excessive amount of thinking.

1001
01:36:49,876 --> 01:36:54,438
- I am programmed
to understand humans!

1002
01:36:58,016 --> 01:36:59,951
"What does that mean?" Oh!

1003
01:37:00,052 --> 01:37:02,748
That means I am in charge here!

1004
01:37:02,854 --> 01:37:06,051
Where are you going now?
You don't know what's out there.

1005
01:37:06,158 --> 01:37:09,355
Have you no sense at all?
Oh! Idiot!

1006
01:37:12,364 --> 01:37:14,832
Please wait.

1007
01:37:14,934 --> 01:37:16,868
Do you know
where you're going?

1008
01:37:29,481 --> 01:37:31,574
Wait.

1009
01:37:39,158 --> 01:37:41,489
Oh, my--
Oh, oh, oh!

1010
01:37:51,671 --> 01:37:54,139
<i>Padmé!</i>

1011
01:38:17,630 --> 01:38:19,621
Ah!

1012
01:38:46,893 --> 01:38:50,293
Oh, my goodness!
Shut me down!

1013
01:38:51,396 --> 01:38:53,364
<i>Machines making machines.</i>

1014
01:38:53,466 --> 01:38:56,264
Huh! How perverse.
Oh!

1015
01:38:56,368 --> 01:38:59,895
Calm down, R2.
I almost fell.

1016
01:39:00,006 --> 01:39:01,997
You'll get your chance--

1017
01:39:03,842 --> 01:39:06,811
Oh! I'm scrap.

1018
01:39:06,912 --> 01:39:09,904
It's a nightmare!

1019
01:39:11,083 --> 01:39:13,051
Oh, I want to go home! Ahh!

1020
01:39:14,487 --> 01:39:16,478
Oh, what did I do
to deserve this?

1021
01:39:38,810 --> 01:39:41,746
Ahhh!

1022
01:39:53,759 --> 01:39:58,627
- Hmm. I wonder what happened
to poor little R2.

1023
01:39:58,730 --> 01:40:01,131
He's always getting himself
into trouble. Oops.

1024
01:40:02,234 --> 01:40:04,100
Oh, no!

1025
01:40:13,512 --> 01:40:15,140
Uh-oh.

1026
01:40:16,314 --> 01:40:18,680
Oh!

1027
01:40:18,783 --> 01:40:20,752
Oh, I'm so confused.

1028
01:42:15,701 --> 01:42:17,725
Oh, not again.

1029
01:42:18,804 --> 01:42:20,771
Obi-Wan's gonna kill me.

1030
01:42:29,914 --> 01:42:32,940
Don't move, Jedi!
Take him away.

1031
01:42:52,371 --> 01:42:55,465
Don't be afraid.

1032
01:42:55,573 --> 01:42:57,564
I'm not afraid to die.

1033
01:43:02,414 --> 01:43:06,545
I've been dying a little bit each day
since you came back into my life.

1034
01:43:07,819 --> 01:43:10,380
What are you talking about?

1035
01:43:11,856 --> 01:43:13,916
I love you.

1036
01:43:17,697 --> 01:43:19,664
You love me?

1037
01:43:24,136 --> 01:43:27,400
I thought that we had decided
not to fall in love...

1038
01:43:29,108 --> 01:43:32,908
that we would be forced
to live a lie...

1039
01:43:33,011 --> 01:43:36,003
and that it would
destroy our lives.

1040
01:43:36,114 --> 01:43:39,175
I think our lives are about
to be destroyed anyway.

1041
01:43:44,323 --> 01:43:47,052
I truly...

1042
01:43:47,158 --> 01:43:49,592
deeply love you...

1043
01:43:50,762 --> 01:43:53,356
and before we die,
I want you to know.

1044
01:44:00,840 --> 01:44:02,966
Eeyah!

1045
01:44:50,488 --> 01:44:53,150
I was beginning to wonder
if you'd got my message.

1046
01:44:53,259 --> 01:44:56,319
I retransmitted it just as
you had requested, Master.

1047
01:44:58,663 --> 01:45:00,564
Then we decided
to come and rescue you.

1048
01:45:01,801 --> 01:45:04,099
Good job.

1049
01:45:14,546 --> 01:45:18,448
Settle down. Settle down.

1050
01:45:22,454 --> 01:45:26,185
Let the executions begin.

1051
01:45:58,923 --> 01:46:01,893
I've got a bad feeling
about this.

1052
01:46:27,418 --> 01:46:29,944
- Just relax. Concentrate.
- What about Padmé?

1053
01:46:30,055 --> 01:46:32,181
She seems to be
on top of things.

1054
01:47:35,154 --> 01:47:38,920
She can't do that!
Shoot her or-- or something!

1055
01:48:32,144 --> 01:48:36,581
Whoa! Yah!

1056
01:48:37,815 --> 01:48:40,046
Hyah! Hyah!

1057
01:48:58,170 --> 01:49:00,604
Jump!

1058
01:49:04,510 --> 01:49:06,603
Hyah! Hyah!

1059
01:49:23,261 --> 01:49:28,597
This isn't how it's supposed to be!
Jango! Finish her off!

1060
01:49:28,701 --> 01:49:31,898
Patience, Viceroy, patience.
She will die.

1061
01:50:03,001 --> 01:50:06,663
Master Windu,
how pleasant of you to join us.

1062
01:50:06,771 --> 01:50:08,796
This party's over.

1063
01:50:22,354 --> 01:50:27,552
Brave but, uh, foolish,
my old Jedi friend.

1064
01:50:27,658 --> 01:50:31,527
- You're impossibly outnumbered.
- I don't think so.

1065
01:50:31,630 --> 01:50:34,257
We'll see.

1066
01:51:10,969 --> 01:51:14,404
My legs aren't moving.
I must need maintenance.

1067
01:51:54,145 --> 01:51:56,613
What's all this noise?
A-A battle!

1068
01:51:56,715 --> 01:51:58,909
Oh, there's been
some terrible mistake!

1069
01:51:59,016 --> 01:52:01,747
I'm programmed for etiquette,
not destruction!

1070
01:53:29,274 --> 01:53:33,005
Die, Jedi dogs!
Oh! What did I say?

1071
01:53:37,149 --> 01:53:39,447
Hah!

1072
01:53:42,054 --> 01:53:45,386
Oh, dear.
I'm terribly sorry about all this.

1073
01:53:46,524 --> 01:53:48,515
Ohh!

1074
01:53:51,029 --> 01:53:53,963
Excuse me. I'm trapped.
I can't get up.

1075
01:54:06,511 --> 01:54:10,072
<i>You call this</i>
<i>a diplomatic solution?</i>

1076
01:54:10,181 --> 01:54:13,640
No, I call it
aggressive negotiations.

1077
01:54:17,055 --> 01:54:19,046
- Uh-oh.
- Roger, roger.

1078
01:54:36,207 --> 01:54:39,472
R2, what are you doing here?

1079
01:54:42,680 --> 01:54:45,274
What <i>are</i> you doing?
Oh, stop that!

1080
01:54:45,384 --> 01:54:47,681
You're going to strain
something. My neck!

1081
01:54:50,087 --> 01:54:53,989
- Now where are you taking me?
Oh, this is such a drag.

1082
01:54:58,229 --> 01:55:01,028
Oh, I'm quite beside myself.

1083
01:55:09,740 --> 01:55:12,801
R2, please be careful!
You're singeing my circuits!

1084
01:55:12,911 --> 01:55:16,938
Yes, but is my head on straight?

1085
01:55:39,770 --> 01:55:43,672
<i>Master Windu,</i>
<i>you have fought gallantly...</i>

1086
01:55:43,774 --> 01:55:48,872
<i>worthy of recognition</i>
<i>in the archives of the Jedi order.</i>

1087
01:55:51,149 --> 01:55:54,140
<i>Now it is finished.</i>

1088
01:55:55,619 --> 01:56:00,421
Surrender,
and your lives will be spared.

1089
01:56:00,524 --> 01:56:04,393
We will not be hostages
to be bartered, Dooku!

1090
01:56:04,496 --> 01:56:09,091
<i>Then, I'm sorry, old friend.</i>

1091
01:56:21,313 --> 01:56:23,203
<i>Look!</i>

1092
01:56:32,356 --> 01:56:37,192
Around the survivors
a perimeter create.

1093
01:57:32,716 --> 01:57:36,743
Oh, I've had
the most peculiar dream.

1094
01:57:47,364 --> 01:57:49,332
If Dooku escapes...

1095
01:57:49,434 --> 01:57:53,927
rally more systems
to his cause he will.

1096
01:57:57,708 --> 01:57:59,939
Hold on!

1097
01:58:04,082 --> 01:58:06,050
Aim right above
the fuel cells!

1098
01:58:12,390 --> 01:58:15,381
Good call,
my young Padawan.

1099
01:58:28,907 --> 01:58:31,204
The Jedi have amassed a huge army.

1100
01:58:31,309 --> 01:58:33,675
That doesn't seem possible.

1101
01:58:33,778 --> 01:58:36,372
How could the Jedi
come up with an army so quickly?

1102
01:58:36,480 --> 01:58:39,746
We must send all available droids
into battle.

1103
01:58:39,850 --> 01:58:41,751
There are too many.

1104
01:58:41,853 --> 01:58:45,481
Our communications have been jammed.

1105
01:58:52,831 --> 01:58:58,029
- Pilot, land in that assembly area!
- Yes, sir.

1106
01:59:06,110 --> 01:59:11,014
Sir, I have five special commando units
awaiting your orders, sir.

1107
01:59:11,115 --> 01:59:14,414
To the forward
command center take me.

1108
01:59:37,708 --> 01:59:40,472
Attack those Federation starships!
Quickly!

1109
01:59:51,422 --> 01:59:55,256
Master Yoda,
all forward positions are advancing.

1110
01:59:55,359 --> 01:59:58,954
Very good.
Very good.

1111
02:00:27,859 --> 02:00:30,953
This is not looking good at all!

1112
02:00:31,061 --> 02:00:34,327
We must get the starships
back into space.

1113
02:00:37,368 --> 02:00:41,305
We have to order a retreat.

1114
02:00:41,405 --> 02:00:43,805
My master
will never allow the Republic...

1115
02:00:43,908 --> 02:00:45,876
to get away
with this treachery.

1116
02:00:45,976 --> 02:00:49,572
<i>I'm sending my warriors</i>
<i>to hide in the catacombs.</i>

1117
02:00:49,680 --> 02:00:53,707
The Jedi must not find
our designs for the ultimate weapon.

1118
02:00:56,154 --> 02:01:01,456
If they find out what we are planning
to build, we're doomed.

1119
02:01:04,695 --> 02:01:07,130
I will take the designs
with me to Coruscant.

1120
02:01:07,231 --> 02:01:10,792
They will be much safer there
with my master.

1121
02:02:05,323 --> 02:02:10,090
Concentrate all your fire
on the nearest starship.

1122
02:02:10,194 --> 02:02:12,060
Yes, sir.

1123
02:02:12,162 --> 02:02:15,621
Move all quadrants
to sector 5-1 -5.

1124
02:02:55,739 --> 02:02:58,640
Look over there!

1125
02:03:00,712 --> 02:03:03,112
It's Dooku!
Shoot him down!

1126
02:03:03,213 --> 02:03:05,113
We're out of rockets, sir.

1127
02:03:05,216 --> 02:03:08,275
- Follow him!
- We're gonna need some help!

1128
02:03:08,386 --> 02:03:12,253
There isn't time!
Anakin and I can handle this!

1129
02:03:29,373 --> 02:03:32,707
<i>Padmé!</i>

1130
02:03:35,712 --> 02:03:38,306
- Put the ship down!
- Anakin!

1131
02:03:38,416 --> 02:03:42,181
Don't let your personal feelings
get in the way! Follow that speeder!

1132
02:03:48,259 --> 02:03:50,625
- Lower the ship!
- I can't take Dooku alone!

1133
02:03:50,728 --> 02:03:54,185
I need you! If we catch him,
we can end this war right now!

1134
02:03:54,298 --> 02:03:57,324
- We have a job to do!
- I don't care! Put the ship down!

1135
02:03:57,435 --> 02:03:59,698
You will be expelled
from the Jedi order!

1136
02:03:59,804 --> 02:04:03,034
- I can't leave her!
- Come to your senses!

1137
02:04:03,140 --> 02:04:06,804
What do you think Padmé would do
were she in your position?

1138
02:04:10,448 --> 02:04:12,472
She would do her duty.

1139
02:04:16,087 --> 02:04:18,112
Hmm.

1140
02:04:21,458 --> 02:04:23,518
The droid army
is in full retreat.

1141
02:04:23,627 --> 02:04:26,721
Well done, Commander.
Bring me a ship.

1142
02:04:53,725 --> 02:04:56,853
You're gonna pay for all
the Jedi that you killed today, Dooku.

1143
02:04:56,961 --> 02:04:59,725
- We'll take him together. Go in slowly on the left.
- I'm taking him now!

1144
02:04:59,831 --> 02:05:02,197
No, Anakin! No! No!

1145
02:05:08,905 --> 02:05:12,398
As you see, my Jedi powers
are far beyond yours.

1146
02:05:12,510 --> 02:05:15,479
Now... back down.

1147
02:05:19,384 --> 02:05:21,578
I don't think so.

1148
02:05:34,431 --> 02:05:37,628
Master Kenobi,
you disappoint me.

1149
02:05:37,734 --> 02:05:40,828
<i>Yoda holds you</i>
<i>in such high esteem.</i>

1150
02:05:44,442 --> 02:05:46,739
Surely you can do better.

1151
02:05:56,820 --> 02:05:58,720
Are you all right?

1152
02:05:58,823 --> 02:06:01,291
Uh-huh.

1153
02:06:01,391 --> 02:06:05,088
- We'd better get back to the forward command center.
- No. No.

1154
02:06:05,195 --> 02:06:08,722
Gather what troops you can.
We've got to get to that hangar.

1155
02:06:08,832 --> 02:06:11,961
- Get a transport. Hurry!
- Right away.

1156
02:06:25,449 --> 02:06:27,884
Ah! Ahh!

1157
02:06:37,095 --> 02:06:40,121
Brave of you, boy.

1158
02:06:40,230 --> 02:06:42,461
<i>But I would have thought</i>
<i>you had learned your lesson.</i>

1159
02:06:42,567 --> 02:06:44,796
- I am a slow learner.
- <i>Anakin!</i>

1160
02:07:46,631 --> 02:07:51,568
- Master Yoda.
- Count Dooku.

1161
02:07:51,668 --> 02:07:55,002
You have interfered with our affairs
for the last time.

1162
02:08:26,337 --> 02:08:29,670
Powerful you have become,
Dooku.

1163
02:08:29,774 --> 02:08:32,833
The dark side I sense in you.

1164
02:08:32,944 --> 02:08:35,777
I've become more powerful
than any Jedi.

1165
02:08:37,081 --> 02:08:39,675
Even you.

1166
02:08:53,898 --> 02:08:56,957
Much to learn you still have.

1167
02:08:57,068 --> 02:09:02,061
It is obvious that this contest cannot be
decided by our knowledge of the Force...

1168
02:09:04,675 --> 02:09:07,269
but by our skills
with a lightsaber.

1169
02:09:48,185 --> 02:09:52,246
Fought well you have,
my old Padawan.

1170
02:09:52,355 --> 02:09:55,051
This is just the beginning.

1171
02:11:09,332 --> 02:11:11,301
Anakin!

1172
02:12:27,310 --> 02:12:30,041
The Force is with us,
Master Sidious.

1173
02:12:30,146 --> 02:12:32,877
Welcome home,
Lord Tyranus.

1174
02:12:34,752 --> 02:12:37,448
You have done well.

1175
02:12:37,555 --> 02:12:39,546
I have good news
for you, my lord.

1176
02:12:41,257 --> 02:12:44,591
- The war has begun.
- Excellent.

1177
02:12:44,694 --> 02:12:47,390
Everything is going
as planned.

1178
02:12:57,341 --> 02:12:59,399
Do you believe
what Count Dooku said...

1179
02:12:59,510 --> 02:13:01,739
about Sidious
controlling the senate?

1180
02:13:01,845 --> 02:13:04,109
It doesn't feel right.

1181
02:13:04,215 --> 02:13:07,184
<i>Joined the dark side</i>
<i>Dooku has.</i>

1182
02:13:07,283 --> 02:13:10,219
Mmm. Lies, deceit...

1183
02:13:10,320 --> 02:13:14,347
creating mistrust
are his ways now.

1184
02:13:14,457 --> 02:13:18,792
<i>Nevertheless, I feel we</i>
<i>should keep a closer eye on the senate.</i>

1185
02:13:18,895 --> 02:13:20,921
I agree.

1186
02:13:22,032 --> 02:13:23,931
Where is your apprentice?

1187
02:13:24,033 --> 02:13:27,935
On his way to Naboo,
escorting Senator Amidala home.

1188
02:13:29,707 --> 02:13:33,369
I have to admit that without the
clones, it would not have been a victory.

1189
02:13:33,476 --> 02:13:35,536
<i>Victory?</i>

1190
02:13:35,645 --> 02:13:38,774
Victory, you say?

1191
02:13:38,882 --> 02:13:42,613
Master Obi-Wan,
not victory.

1192
02:13:44,154 --> 02:13:47,386
The shroud of the dark side
has fallen.

1193
02:13:49,025 --> 02:13:52,518
Begun the Clone War has.
