1
00:03:32,585 --> 00:03:34,497
Echo Three to Echo Seven.

2
00:03:34,545 --> 00:03:36,634
Han, old buddy,
do you read me?

3
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:38,804
Loud and clear, kid.
What's up?

4
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:41,625
I finished my circle.
I don't pick up any life readings.

5
00:03:41,635 --> 00:03:44,680
There isn't enough life on this ice cube
to fill a space cruiser.

6
00:03:44,716 --> 00:03:46,550
The sensors are placed.
I'm going back.

7
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:48,557
Right. I'll see you shortly.

8
00:03:48,602 --> 00:03:50,776
There's a meteorite
that hit the ground near here.

9
00:03:50,812 --> 00:03:53,116
I want to check it out.
It won't take long.

10
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:54,235
Steady.

11
00:03:55,608 --> 00:03:59,001
Steady, girl. What's the matter?
You smell something?

12
00:04:40,028 --> 00:04:41,942
Chewie. Chewie?

13
00:04:47,786 --> 00:04:50,177
All right.
Don't lose your temper.

14
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:52,728
I'll come right back
and give you a hand.

15
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,317
Solo.

16
00:05:14,398 --> 00:05:17,269
No sign of life out there, General.
The sensors are in place.

17
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:20,189
- You'll know if anything comes around.
- Commander Skywalker reported in yet?

18
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:23,108
No. He's checking out
a meteorite that hit near him.

19
00:05:23,113 --> 00:05:26,742
With all the meteor activity, it's gonna
be difficult to spot approaching ships.

20
00:05:26,742 --> 00:05:28,744
General, I gotta leave.
I can't stay any more.

21
00:05:28,788 --> 00:05:31,745
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- There's a price on my head.

22
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:34,183
If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt,
I'm a dead man.

23
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:36,122
A death mark's not
an easy thing to live with.

24
00:05:37,547 --> 00:05:40,244
You're a good fighter, Solo.
I hate to lose you.

25
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:41,737
Thank you, General.

26
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:51,853
Well, Your Highness,
guess this is it.

27
00:05:52,728 --> 00:05:53,816
That's right.

28
00:05:56,649 --> 00:05:59,127
Don't get all mushy on me.
So long, Princess.

29
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,290
Han.

30
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:08,244
- Yes, Your Highnessness.
- I thought you had decided to stay.

31
00:06:08,245 --> 00:06:11,201
The bounty hunter we ran into
in Ord Mantell changed my mind.

32
00:06:11,206 --> 00:06:13,555
Han, we need you.

33
00:06:13,584 --> 00:06:15,757
- We need?
- Yes.

34
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:18,358
- What about you need?
- I need?

35
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:20,944
I don't know what
you're talking about.

36
00:06:20,966 --> 00:06:24,593
- You probably don't.
- What precisely am I supposed to know?

37
00:06:24,595 --> 00:06:28,180
Come on. You want me to stay because
of the way you feel about me.

38
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,877
Yes. You're a great help to us.
You're a natural leader.

39
00:06:30,893 --> 00:06:33,545
No. That's not it.

40
00:06:33,562 --> 00:06:35,257
Come on.

41
00:06:36,481 --> 00:06:38,569
- Come on.
- You're imagining things.

42
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:40,610
Am I?
Then why are you following me?

43
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:42,956
Afraid I'd leave
without giving you a goodbye kiss?

44
00:06:42,987 --> 00:06:45,685
- I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee.
- I can arrange that.

45
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:47,917
You could use a good kiss!

46
00:06:48,869 --> 00:06:51,696
Don't blame me. I didn't ask you
to turn on the thermal heater.

47
00:06:51,706 --> 00:06:55,250
I merely commented that it was freezing
in the princess's chamber.

48
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,163
It's supposed to be freezing.

49
00:06:57,211 --> 00:06:59,733
How we're going to dry
her clothes I really don't know.

50
00:06:59,755 --> 00:07:01,016
Oh, switch off!

51
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:04,300
Why did you take this apart now?
I'm trying to get us out of here.

52
00:07:04,302 --> 00:07:06,519
- Excuse me.
- Put them back together right now.

53
00:07:06,553 --> 00:07:08,685
- Might I have a word?
- What do you want?

54
00:07:08,723 --> 00:07:11,331
Princess Leia's been trying
to get you on the communicator.

55
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,612
I turned it off.
I don't want to talk to her.

56
00:07:13,644 --> 00:07:16,646
Princess Leia is wondering about
Master Luke. He hasn't come back.

57
00:07:16,648 --> 00:07:18,995
- She doesn't know where he is.
- I don't know where he is.

58
00:07:19,026 --> 00:07:21,939
- Nobody knows where he is.
- What do you mean, nobody knows?

59
00:07:21,944 --> 00:07:23,293
Deck Officer.

60
00:07:23,362 --> 00:07:25,971
- Deck Officer.
- Excuse me, sir. Might l...

61
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:27,817
Do you know where
Commander Skywalker is?

62
00:07:27,867 --> 00:07:30,651
I haven't seen him. It's possible
he came in the south entrance.

63
00:07:30,663 --> 00:07:32,966
It's possible?
Why don't you go find out?

64
00:07:32,997 --> 00:07:35,651
- It's getting dark out there.
- Yes, sir.

65
00:07:35,668 --> 00:07:38,146
Excuse me, sir.
Might I enquire what's going on?

66
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:40,562
- Why not?
- Impossible man.

67
00:07:40,588 --> 00:07:42,675
Come along, R2.
Let's find Princess Leia.

68
00:07:42,716 --> 00:07:45,891
Between ourselves, I think
Master Luke is in considerable danger.

69
00:07:55,396 --> 00:07:57,656
Commander Skywalker
hasn't come in the south entrance.

70
00:07:57,689 --> 00:08:00,255
- Maybe he forgot to check in.
- Not likely. Are the speeders ready?

71
00:08:00,276 --> 00:08:02,449
Not yet. We're having trouble
adapting them to the cold.

72
00:08:02,485 --> 00:08:05,574
- We'll have to go out on tauntauns.
- The temperature's dropping too rapidly.

73
00:08:05,608 --> 00:08:07,702
That's right,
and my friend's out in it.

74
00:08:12,413 --> 00:08:14,980
Your tauntaun will freeze
before you reach the first marker.

75
00:08:14,999 --> 00:08:17,129
Then I'll see you in hell.

76
00:10:34,893 --> 00:10:36,849
You must come along now, R2.

77
00:10:36,894 --> 00:10:39,024
There's really
nothing more we can do.

78
00:10:39,063 --> 00:10:41,238
And my joints are freezing up.

79
00:10:42,232 --> 00:10:46,277
Don't say things like that.
Of course we'll see Master Luke again.

80
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:49,149
And he'll be quite all right.
You'll see.

81
00:10:49,158 --> 00:10:52,941
Stupid little short circuit.
He'll be quite all right.

82
00:11:50,386 --> 00:11:53,342
Sir, all the patrols are in.
Still no...

83
00:11:54,472 --> 00:11:57,431
Still no contact
from Skywalker or Solo.

84
00:11:57,434 --> 00:12:01,645
Mistress Leia, R2 says he's been
quite unable to pick up any signals...

85
00:12:01,647 --> 00:12:05,149
although he admits that his own range
is far too weak to abandon all hope.

86
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:07,369
Your Highness,
there's nothing more we can do tonight.

87
00:12:07,403 --> 00:12:09,837
The shield doors must be closed.

88
00:12:11,073 --> 00:12:13,596
- Close the doors.
- Yes, sir.

89
00:12:14,995 --> 00:12:19,951
R2 says the chances
of survival are 725-to-1.

90
00:12:31,345 --> 00:12:35,215
Actually, R2 has been known
to make mistakes...

91
00:12:37,767 --> 00:12:39,855
from time to time.

92
00:12:39,895 --> 00:12:41,808
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

93
00:12:44,692 --> 00:12:47,432
Don't worry about Master Luke.
I'm sure he'll be all right.

94
00:12:47,443 --> 00:12:50,357
He's quite clever, you know,
for a human being.

95
00:13:06,379 --> 00:13:08,120
Luke.

96
00:13:09,884 --> 00:13:11,275
Luke.

97
00:13:18,726 --> 00:13:20,336
Ben?

98
00:13:20,394 --> 00:13:23,134
You will go to
the Dagobah system.

99
00:13:23,148 --> 00:13:24,975
Dagobah system?

100
00:13:25,024 --> 00:13:28,610
There you will
learn from Yoda...

101
00:13:28,611 --> 00:13:32,524
the Jedi master
who instructed me.

102
00:13:50,842 --> 00:13:54,365
Don't do this, Luke.
Give me a sign here.

103
00:14:17,953 --> 00:14:20,346
- Not much time.
- Ben.

104
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:27,923
Hang on, kid.

105
00:14:30,048 --> 00:14:32,354
Dagobah system. Dagobah.

106
00:14:32,384 --> 00:14:34,125
This may smell bad, kid...

107
00:14:35,429 --> 00:14:37,429
Yoda.

108
00:14:37,475 --> 00:14:42,059
But it'll keep you warm
till I get the shelter up.

109
00:14:42,061 --> 00:14:44,192
Ben. Dagobah.

110
00:14:48,027 --> 00:14:50,114
I thought they smelled bad...

111
00:14:50,153 --> 00:14:52,067
on the outside.

112
00:15:35,325 --> 00:15:37,846
Echo Base, I've got something.

113
00:15:37,868 --> 00:15:39,869
Not much,
but it could be a life form.

114
00:15:44,417 --> 00:15:46,765
Commander Skywalker,
do you copy?

115
00:15:46,794 --> 00:15:51,578
This is Rogue Two.

116
00:15:51,591 --> 00:15:54,548
Captain Solo, do you copy?

117
00:16:00,142 --> 00:16:03,726
Commander Skywalker,
do you copy?

118
00:16:03,727 --> 00:16:05,643
This is Rogue Two.

119
00:16:05,688 --> 00:16:08,907
Good morning.
Nice of you guys to drop by.

120
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:12,903
Echo Base, this is Rogue Two.

121
00:16:12,904 --> 00:16:15,600
I've found them.
Repeat. I've found them.

122
00:16:46,145 --> 00:16:49,536
Master Luke, sir, it's so good
to see you fully functional again.

123
00:16:49,567 --> 00:16:52,394
- Thanks, 3PO.
- R2 expresses his relief also.

124
00:16:52,403 --> 00:16:56,032
How ya feelin', kid?
You don't look so bad to me.

125
00:16:56,033 --> 00:16:59,033
You look strong enough
to pull the ears off a gundark.

126
00:16:59,036 --> 00:17:02,953
- Thanks to you.
- That's two you owe me, junior.

127
00:17:02,956 --> 00:17:04,347
Well, Your Worship...

128
00:17:04,414 --> 00:17:07,626
Iooks like you managed to keep me around
for a little while longer.

129
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:09,585
I had nothing to do with it.

130
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:12,368
General Rieekan thinks
it's dangerous for any ships to leave...

131
00:17:12,382 --> 00:17:14,382
until we've activated the energy field.

132
00:17:14,425 --> 00:17:15,730
That's a good story.

133
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:19,846
I think you just can't bear to let a
gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.

134
00:17:19,847 --> 00:17:23,284
I don't know where
you get your delusions, laser brain.

135
00:17:26,605 --> 00:17:28,911
Laugh it up, fuzzball...

136
00:17:28,941 --> 00:17:32,151
but you didn't see us alone
in the south passage.

137
00:17:32,153 --> 00:17:34,500
She expressed
her true feelings for me.

138
00:17:34,529 --> 00:17:35,703
My...

139
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:39,326
Why, you stuck-up, half-witted...

140
00:17:39,326 --> 00:17:41,458
scruffy-looking nerf herder!

141
00:17:42,663 --> 00:17:44,621
Who's scruffy-lookin'?

142
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,441
I must have hit close to the mark
to get her riled up like that, huh, kid?

143
00:17:55,009 --> 00:17:58,009
I guess you don't know
everything about women yet.

144
00:18:04,144 --> 00:18:06,926
Headquarters personnel,
report to command centre.

145
00:18:09,775 --> 00:18:12,818
Headquarters personnel,
report to command centre.

146
00:18:12,854 --> 00:18:14,863
Take it easy.

147
00:18:14,903 --> 00:18:17,036
Excuse us, please.

148
00:18:19,242 --> 00:18:21,375
Princess, we have a visitor.

149
00:18:22,453 --> 00:18:25,453
We picked up something
outside Zone 12 moving east.

150
00:18:25,455 --> 00:18:27,805
- It's metal.
- It couldn't be one of those creatures.

151
00:18:27,834 --> 00:18:31,753
- Could be one of our speeders.
- No. Wait.

152
00:18:31,755 --> 00:18:34,494
There's something
very weak coming through.

153
00:18:37,721 --> 00:18:40,888
Sir, I am fluent in six million
forms of communication.

154
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:44,151
This signal is not used by the Alliance.
It could be an imperial code.

155
00:18:50,023 --> 00:18:52,153
It isn't friendly.
Chewie, let's check it out.

156
00:18:52,193 --> 00:18:55,324
Send Rogues 10 and 11
to Station 38.

157
00:19:31,398 --> 00:19:33,530
- I'm afraid there's not much left.
- What was it?

158
00:19:33,567 --> 00:19:35,699
Droid of some kind.
I didn't hit it that hard.

159
00:19:35,737 --> 00:19:39,323
- Must have had a self-destruct.
- An imperial probe droid.

160
00:19:39,324 --> 00:19:42,325
It's a good bet the Empire
knows we're here.

161
00:19:42,326 --> 00:19:44,633
We'd better start the evacuation.

162
00:20:29,542 --> 00:20:32,151
- Admiral.
- Yes, Captain?

163
00:20:33,461 --> 00:20:36,462
I think we've got something, sir.
The report is only a fragment...

164
00:20:36,465 --> 00:20:39,467
from a probe droid in the Hoth system,
but it's the best lead we've had.

165
00:20:39,469 --> 00:20:42,680
We have thousands of probe droids
searching the galaxy.

166
00:20:42,681 --> 00:20:45,765
- I want proof, not leads.
- The visuals indicate life readings.

167
00:20:45,766 --> 00:20:48,115
It could mean anything.
If we followed up every lead...

168
00:20:48,144 --> 00:20:51,319
But, sir, the Hoth system is
supposed to be devoid of humans forms.

169
00:20:51,355 --> 00:20:53,791
- You found something?
- Yes, my lord.

170
00:20:56,153 --> 00:20:58,545
That's it.
The rebels are there.

171
00:20:59,404 --> 00:21:03,159
My lord, there are so many
uncharted settlements.

172
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,030
- It could be smugglers...
- That is the system.

173
00:21:06,038 --> 00:21:08,517
And I'm sure Skywalker is with them.

174
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:11,667
Set your course
for the Hoth system.

175
00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:14,191
General Veers,
prepare your men.

176
00:21:14,213 --> 00:21:15,605
Admiral.

177
00:21:22,305 --> 00:21:24,522
Groups Seven and 10
will stay behind to fly the speeders.

178
00:21:24,557 --> 00:21:26,470
As soon as each transport is loaded...

179
00:21:26,518 --> 00:21:28,646
evacuation control
will give clearance for launch.

180
00:21:28,685 --> 00:21:30,425
Right, sir.

181
00:21:32,523 --> 00:21:34,654
All right. That's it.

182
00:21:34,692 --> 00:21:36,171
Try it.

183
00:21:37,904 --> 00:21:40,730
Turn it off! Turn it off!

184
00:21:43,034 --> 00:21:46,537
Sir, it will take quite a while
to evacuate the T-47 s.

185
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:50,290
Forget the heavy equipment. There's time
to get small modules on the transports.

186
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:52,423
- Take care, sir.
- Thanks.

187
00:21:55,755 --> 00:21:59,016
Chewie, take care of yourself, okay?

188
00:22:02,637 --> 00:22:04,334
Okay, okay.

189
00:22:05,723 --> 00:22:07,247
Hi, kid.

190
00:22:07,308 --> 00:22:10,519
There's gotta be a reason for it.
Check it at the other end.

191
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:11,999
Wait a second.

192
00:22:13,022 --> 00:22:15,545
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

193
00:22:21,657 --> 00:22:23,917
Be careful.

194
00:22:23,951 --> 00:22:25,864
You too.

195
00:22:31,916 --> 00:22:33,874
General, there's
a fleet of Stardestroyers...

196
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,269
coming out of hyperspace
in Sector Four.

197
00:22:36,298 --> 00:22:39,382
Reroute all power
to the energy shield.

198
00:22:39,383 --> 00:22:42,594
We gotta hold them till
all transports are away.

199
00:22:42,595 --> 00:22:44,724
Prepare for ground assault.

200
00:22:58,528 --> 00:23:01,989
- What is it, General?
- The fleet has moved out of light speed.

201
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:04,163
ComScan has detected
an energy field...

202
00:23:04,201 --> 00:23:06,895
protecting an area of the sixth planet
of the Hoth system.

203
00:23:06,912 --> 00:23:09,477
The field is strong enough
to deflect any bombardment.

204
00:23:09,498 --> 00:23:12,063
The rebels are alerted
to our presence.

205
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:15,295
Admiral Ozzel came out of light speed
too close to the system.

206
00:23:15,296 --> 00:23:17,644
He felt surprise was wiser.

207
00:23:17,673 --> 00:23:19,846
He is as clumsy as he is stupid.

208
00:23:19,883 --> 00:23:23,594
General, prepare your troops
for a surface attack.

209
00:23:23,595 --> 00:23:25,290
Yes, my lord.

210
00:23:32,104 --> 00:23:33,364
Lord Vader.

211
00:23:33,439 --> 00:23:36,569
The fleet has moved out of light speed,
and we're preparing to...

212
00:23:37,527 --> 00:23:41,779
You have failed me
for the last time, Admiral.

213
00:23:41,781 --> 00:23:44,259
- Captain Piett.
- Yes, my lord?

214
00:23:44,282 --> 00:23:47,409
Make ready to land our troops
beyond their energy field...

215
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:50,497
and deploy the fleet so that
nothing gets off the system.

216
00:23:50,498 --> 00:23:53,791
You are in command now,
Admiral Piett.

217
00:23:53,792 --> 00:23:55,705
Thank you, Lord Vader.

218
00:23:57,212 --> 00:24:00,423
All troop carriers will assemble
at the north entrance.

219
00:24:00,424 --> 00:24:03,208
The heavy transport ships
will leave as soon as they're loaded.

220
00:24:03,219 --> 00:24:05,351
Only two fighter escorts per ship.

221
00:24:05,387 --> 00:24:08,598
The energy shield
can only be opened for a short time...

222
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:11,210
so you'll have to stay very close
to your transports.

223
00:24:11,228 --> 00:24:13,402
Two fighters against a Stardestroyer?

224
00:24:13,438 --> 00:24:15,568
The ion cannon will fire
several shots...

225
00:24:15,605 --> 00:24:18,859
to make sure that any enemy ships
will be out of your flight path.

226
00:24:18,861 --> 00:24:21,035
When you've gotten past
the energy shield...

227
00:24:21,069 --> 00:24:23,201
proceed directly
to the rendezvous point.

228
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,240
Understood?

229
00:24:25,284 --> 00:24:26,936
Good luck.

230
00:24:26,993 --> 00:24:29,557
Everybody to your stations.
Let's go.

231
00:24:46,596 --> 00:24:49,807
Their primary target will be
the power generators.

232
00:24:49,807 --> 00:24:51,721
Prepare to open shield.

233
00:24:57,482 --> 00:24:59,743
Sir, rebel ships are
coming into our sector.

234
00:24:59,776 --> 00:25:01,951
Good. Our first catch of the day.

235
00:25:03,905 --> 00:25:06,037
Stand by, ion control.

236
00:25:07,035 --> 00:25:08,078
Fire.

237
00:25:23,301 --> 00:25:29,340
The first transport is away.

238
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:37,688
Feeling all right, sir?

239
00:25:37,732 --> 00:25:39,690
Just like new, Dak.
How about you?

240
00:25:39,733 --> 00:25:42,778
Right now I feel I could take on
the whole Empire myself.

241
00:25:42,814 --> 00:25:44,911
I know what you mean.

242
00:26:03,174 --> 00:26:06,595
Echo Station 3-T8.
We've spotted imperial walkers.

243
00:26:06,596 --> 00:26:09,161
Imperial walkers
on the north ridge.

244
00:26:31,163 --> 00:26:33,554
Echo Station 57,
we're on our way.

245
00:26:38,878 --> 00:26:40,967
All right, boys,
keep tight now.

246
00:26:41,006 --> 00:26:43,223
Luke, I have no approach vector.
I'm not set.

247
00:26:43,258 --> 00:26:44,779
Steady, Dak.

248
00:26:44,844 --> 00:26:46,757
Attack pattern Delta.
Go now.

249
00:26:50,471 --> 00:26:52,169
I'm coming in.

250
00:26:56,646 --> 00:26:57,733
Hobbie, you still with me?

251
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,637
That armour's too strong for blasters.

252
00:27:25,009 --> 00:27:27,270
Rogue Group,
use your harpoons and tow cables.

253
00:27:27,303 --> 00:27:29,565
Go for the legs.
It might be our only chance.

254
00:27:31,848 --> 00:27:33,153
Stand by, Dak.

255
00:27:33,226 --> 00:27:36,140
Luke, we've got
a malfunction in fire control.

256
00:27:36,144 --> 00:27:38,232
I'll have to cut in the auxiliary.

257
00:27:38,271 --> 00:27:40,229
Just hang on.

258
00:27:40,273 --> 00:27:43,189
Hang on, Dak.
Get ready to fire that tow cable.

259
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:49,490
Dak?

260
00:28:13,601 --> 00:28:16,644
Yes, Lord Vader.
I've reached the main power generators.

261
00:28:16,644 --> 00:28:19,863
The shield will be down in moments.
You may start your landing.

262
00:28:24,737 --> 00:28:25,954
Rogue Three.

263
00:28:26,029 --> 00:28:27,509
Copy, Rogue Leader.

264
00:28:27,574 --> 00:28:30,657
Wedge, I've lost my gunner.
You'll have to make this shot.

265
00:28:30,659 --> 00:28:32,442
I'll cover for you.

266
00:28:32,493 --> 00:28:34,930
Set your harpoon.
Follow me on the next pass.

267
00:28:36,082 --> 00:28:38,083
Coming around, Rogue Leader.

268
00:28:40,878 --> 00:28:42,398
Steady, Rogue Two.

269
00:28:43,338 --> 00:28:44,425
Activate harpoon.

270
00:28:47,384 --> 00:28:48,951
Good shot, Janson.

271
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:57,325
One more pass.

272
00:29:02,817 --> 00:29:05,165
Cable out.
Let her go!

273
00:29:05,195 --> 00:29:06,457
Detach cable.

274
00:29:07,155 --> 00:29:08,329
Cable detached.

275
00:29:16,164 --> 00:29:17,859
Come on!

276
00:29:25,633 --> 00:29:28,328
- That got him!
- I see it, Wedge. Good work.

277
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,891
I don't think we can protect
two transports at a time.

278
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:33,322
It's risky, but we can't
hold out much longer.

279
00:29:33,348 --> 00:29:35,045
We have no choice.

280
00:29:35,934 --> 00:29:38,717
- Launch patrol.
- Evacuate remaining ground staff.

281
00:29:43,484 --> 00:29:47,153
This one goes there,
that one goes there. Right?

282
00:29:47,153 --> 00:29:50,763
R2, you take good care
of Master Luke now, understand?

283
00:29:52,451 --> 00:29:54,669
And do take good care of yourself.

284
00:29:58,290 --> 00:29:59,856
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

285
00:30:23,607 --> 00:30:26,042
All troops will debark
for ground assault.

286
00:30:26,068 --> 00:30:28,635
Prepare to target
the main generator.

287
00:30:32,201 --> 00:30:35,786
- Rogue Two, are you all right?
- Yeah. I'm with you, Rogue Leader.

288
00:30:35,787 --> 00:30:37,700
Set harpoon.
I'll cover for you.

289
00:30:39,207 --> 00:30:42,251
- Coming around.
- Watch that crossfire, boys.

290
00:30:43,587 --> 00:30:45,457
Set for position three.

291
00:30:45,506 --> 00:30:46,855
Steady.

292
00:30:46,923 --> 00:30:49,532
Stay tight and low.
This is it!

293
00:30:55,307 --> 00:30:56,613
Hobbie!

294
00:30:56,683 --> 00:30:58,205
I've been hit!

295
00:31:40,895 --> 00:31:43,679
- You all right?
- Why are you still here?

296
00:31:43,691 --> 00:31:46,817
- Heard the command centre had been hit.
- You've got your clearance to leave.

297
00:31:46,818 --> 00:31:50,363
Don't worry. I'll leave.
First I'm gonna get you to your ship.

298
00:31:50,364 --> 00:31:53,574
Your Highness, we must take
this last transport. It's our only hope.

299
00:31:53,575 --> 00:31:56,794
Send all troops in Sector 12 to
the south slope to protect the fighters.

300
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:00,461
Imperial troops
have entered the base.

301
00:32:00,499 --> 00:32:02,193
Imperial troops have entered...

302
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:04,207
Come on. That's it.

303
00:32:04,253 --> 00:32:06,689
Give the evacuation code signal.

304
00:32:08,508 --> 00:32:10,640
And get to your transports.

305
00:32:10,676 --> 00:32:11,851
Wait for me.

306
00:32:11,928 --> 00:32:13,450
Begin retreat!

307
00:32:14,471 --> 00:32:16,384
Fall back!

308
00:33:14,074 --> 00:33:17,467
- Distance to power generators?
- 17.28.

309
00:33:26,461 --> 00:33:28,461
Target. Maximum firepower.

310
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:57,436
Transport, this is Solo.
Take off. I can't get to you.

311
00:33:57,451 --> 00:33:59,452
I'll get her out on the Falcon.
Come on.

312
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:04,128
Where are you going?
Come back!

313
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:26,063
Wait! Wait for me! Stop!

314
00:34:26,065 --> 00:34:27,978
- How typical.
- Come on.

315
00:34:31,822 --> 00:34:34,864
Hurry up, goldenrod!
You're gonna be a permanent resident.

316
00:34:34,865 --> 00:34:36,690
Wait! Wait!

317
00:34:54,552 --> 00:34:57,847
- How's this?
- Would it help if I got out and pushed?

318
00:34:57,847 --> 00:35:00,152
- Captain Solo. Captain Solo.
- It might.

319
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:04,135
Sir, might I suggest that you...

320
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:05,884
It can wait.

321
00:35:10,068 --> 00:35:12,677
This bucket of bolts
will never get past that blockade.

322
00:35:12,697 --> 00:35:14,827
This baby's got
a few surprises left in her.

323
00:35:23,916 --> 00:35:25,786
Come on! Come on!

324
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:28,922
Switch over.
Let's hope we don't have a burnout.

325
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,534
See?

326
00:35:31,632 --> 00:35:34,023
Someday you'll be wrong.
I hope I'm there to see it.

327
00:35:36,804 --> 00:35:37,978
Punch it!

328
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:57,076
R2.

329
00:35:58,701 --> 00:36:00,831
Get her ready for take-off.

330
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:05,300
Good luck, Luke.
See you at the rendezvous.

331
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:11,235
Don't worry, R2.
We're going. We're going.

332
00:36:23,268 --> 00:36:27,007
There's nothing wrong, R2.
I'm just setting a new course.

333
00:36:30,317 --> 00:36:34,666
We're not gonna regroup with the others.
We're going to the Dagobah system.

334
00:36:36,865 --> 00:36:38,387
Yes, R2.

335
00:36:41,244 --> 00:36:44,331
That's all right. I'd like to keep it
on manual control for a while.

336
00:37:00,931 --> 00:37:03,411
- I saw 'em! I saw 'em!
- Saw what?

337
00:37:03,434 --> 00:37:05,695
Stardestroyers,
two of'em coming right at us.

338
00:37:05,728 --> 00:37:08,641
- Sir, might I suggest...
- Shut him up or shut him down!

339
00:37:10,315 --> 00:37:12,445
Check the deflector shield.

340
00:37:14,402 --> 00:37:16,534
Great. Well, we can still
outmanoeuvre them.

341
00:37:20,784 --> 00:37:22,829
Take evasive action!

342
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:37,211
- Prepare to jump to light speed.
- But, sir!

343
00:37:38,094 --> 00:37:39,876
They're getting closer.

344
00:37:39,929 --> 00:37:42,148
Oh, yeah?
Watch this.

345
00:37:45,184 --> 00:37:46,880
Watch what?

346
00:37:48,396 --> 00:37:50,961
- I think we're in trouble.
- If I may say so...

347
00:37:50,981 --> 00:37:53,547
I noticed earlier the hyperdrive
motivator has been damaged.

348
00:37:53,568 --> 00:37:56,786
- It's impossible to go to light speed.
- We're in trouble.

349
00:38:00,952 --> 00:38:02,255
Horizontal boosters!

350
00:38:04,413 --> 00:38:06,500
Alluvial dampers.

351
00:38:09,251 --> 00:38:12,034
That's not it.
Bring me the hydrospanner.

352
00:38:15,423 --> 00:38:18,206
I don't know how
we're gonna get out of this one.

353
00:38:20,804 --> 00:38:22,065
Chewie!

354
00:38:25,686 --> 00:38:27,815
That wasn't a laser blast.
Something hit us.

355
00:38:27,855 --> 00:38:29,333
Han, get up here.

356
00:38:31,023 --> 00:38:32,501
Come on, Chewie!

357
00:38:33,275 --> 00:38:34,320
Asteroids.

358
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:40,936
- Chewie, set 271.
- What are you doing?

359
00:38:42,327 --> 00:38:44,632
You're not actually going
into an asteroid field?

360
00:38:44,663 --> 00:38:46,489
They'd be crazy to follow us,
wouldn't they?

361
00:38:49,625 --> 00:38:51,626
You don't have to do this
to impress me.

362
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:54,963
Sir, the possibility of successfully
navigating an asteroid field...

363
00:38:54,965 --> 00:38:58,356
- is approximately 3,720-to-1.
- Never tell me the odds.

364
00:39:26,206 --> 00:39:29,456
You said you wanted to be around when
I made a mistake. This could be it.

365
00:39:29,458 --> 00:39:31,153
I take it back.

366
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:34,420
We're gonna get pulverized
if we stay out here much longer.

367
00:39:34,422 --> 00:39:36,291
- Ain't gonna argue with that.
- Pulverized?

368
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,255
I'm going closer
to one of the big ones.

369
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,213
- Closer?
- Closer?

370
00:40:07,248 --> 00:40:09,204
This is suicide!
There's nowhere to go.

371
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:11,291
There. That looks pretty good.

372
00:40:11,333 --> 00:40:13,291
What looks pretty good?

373
00:40:13,335 --> 00:40:15,815
Yeah. That'll do nicely.

374
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,797
Excuse me, ma'am,
but where are we going?

375
00:40:28,643 --> 00:40:30,949
I hope you know
what you're doing.

376
00:40:30,981 --> 00:40:32,458
Yeah. Me too.

377
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:43,547
Yep, that's it. Dagobah.

378
00:40:45,911 --> 00:40:48,217
No, I'm not gonna change
my mind about this.

379
00:40:49,081 --> 00:40:51,648
I'm not picking up
any cities or technology.

380
00:40:51,668 --> 00:40:53,797
Massive life form readings though.

381
00:40:54,795 --> 00:40:56,925
There's something alive down there.

382
00:40:58,507 --> 00:41:01,509
Yes. I'm sure
it's perfectly safe for droids.

383
00:41:09,101 --> 00:41:10,885
I know! I know!

384
00:41:10,936 --> 00:41:13,721
All the scopes are dead.
I can't see a thing.

385
00:41:13,731 --> 00:41:16,905
Just hang on.
I'm gonna start the landing cycle.

386
00:42:10,916 --> 00:42:13,655
No, R2, you stay put.
I'll have a look around.

387
00:42:18,047 --> 00:42:19,309
R2?

388
00:42:23,219 --> 00:42:24,393
Where are you?

389
00:42:28,016 --> 00:42:29,364
R2!

390
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:37,800
You be more careful.

391
00:42:40,778 --> 00:42:43,693
R2, that way.

392
00:43:11,643 --> 00:43:13,036
R2!

393
00:43:40,632 --> 00:43:42,197
Oh, no.

394
00:43:43,385 --> 00:43:45,516
Are you all right?
Come on.

395
00:43:48,974 --> 00:43:51,105
You were lucky
to get out of there.

396
00:43:52,268 --> 00:43:54,139
Anything broken?

397
00:43:56,813 --> 00:44:00,025
If you're saying
coming here was a bad idea...

398
00:44:00,027 --> 00:44:02,289
I'm beginning to agree with ya.

399
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:05,103
R2, what are we doing here?

400
00:44:05,115 --> 00:44:06,594
It's like...

401
00:44:07,617 --> 00:44:09,748
something out of a dream or...

402
00:44:10,621 --> 00:44:12,753
I don't know.

403
00:44:12,789 --> 00:44:14,922
Maybe I'm just going crazy.

404
00:44:47,199 --> 00:44:48,635
Yes, Admiral?

405
00:44:48,702 --> 00:44:50,876
Our ships have sighted
the Millennium Falcon, lord...

406
00:44:50,911 --> 00:44:54,123
but it has entered an asteroid field,
and we cannot risk...

407
00:44:54,123 --> 00:44:57,036
Asteroids do not
concern me, Admiral.

408
00:44:57,043 --> 00:45:00,740
- I want that ship, not excuses.
- Yes, lord.

409
00:45:06,719 --> 00:45:09,931
I'm gonna shut down everything
but the emergency power systems.

410
00:45:09,931 --> 00:45:14,018
Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but does
that include shutting me down too?

411
00:45:14,019 --> 00:45:16,150
No. I need you
to talk to the Falcon...

412
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:18,538
find out what's wrong
with the hyperdrive.

413
00:45:26,282 --> 00:45:29,909
Sir, it's quite possible
this asteroid is not entirely stable.

414
00:45:29,911 --> 00:45:31,867
Not entirely stable?

415
00:45:31,913 --> 00:45:34,043
I'm glad you're here
to tell us these things.

416
00:45:34,081 --> 00:45:37,791
Chewie, take the professor in the back
and plug him into the hyperdrive.

417
00:45:37,793 --> 00:45:40,402
Sometimes I just don't
understand human behaviour.

418
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:42,856
After all, I'm only
trying to do my job.

419
00:45:47,844 --> 00:45:49,324
Let go.

420
00:45:51,099 --> 00:45:53,490
- Let go, please.
- Don't get excited.

421
00:45:53,518 --> 00:45:57,355
Captain, being held by you
isn't quite enough to get me excited.

422
00:45:57,356 --> 00:45:59,269
Sorry, sweetheart.

423
00:45:59,317 --> 00:46:02,099
I haven't got time
for anything else.

424
00:46:36,436 --> 00:46:40,003
Ready for some power?
Okay.

425
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:45,340
Let's see now.

426
00:46:45,403 --> 00:46:47,795
Put that in there.
There you go.

427
00:46:50,827 --> 00:46:53,697
Now all I gotta do
is find this Yoda...

428
00:46:53,704 --> 00:46:56,097
if he even exists.

429
00:47:01,503 --> 00:47:04,548
It's really a strange place
to find a Jedi master.

430
00:47:05,885 --> 00:47:07,797
This place gives me the creeps.

431
00:47:11,639 --> 00:47:13,117
Still...

432
00:47:14,349 --> 00:47:16,436
there's something familiar
about this place.

433
00:47:18,605 --> 00:47:20,474
I don't know.

434
00:47:20,523 --> 00:47:22,655
- I feel like...
- Feel like what?

435
00:47:23,652 --> 00:47:25,347
Like we're being watched.

436
00:47:25,402 --> 00:47:28,534
Away put your weapon.
I mean you no harm.

437
00:47:29,657 --> 00:47:32,442
I am wondering,
why are you here?

438
00:47:34,038 --> 00:47:37,164
- I'm looking for someone.
- Looking?

439
00:47:37,166 --> 00:47:39,905
Found someone you have,
I would say.

440
00:47:41,003 --> 00:47:42,612
Right.

441
00:47:43,505 --> 00:47:45,985
Help you I can. Yes.

442
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:48,019
I don't think so.

443
00:47:49,596 --> 00:47:52,422
I'm looking for a great warrior.

444
00:47:52,431 --> 00:47:54,128
Great warrior.

445
00:47:57,143 --> 00:47:59,492
Wars not make one great.

446
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:09,563
Put that down.

447
00:48:09,615 --> 00:48:11,617
Hey! That's my dinner.

448
00:48:14,871 --> 00:48:17,697
How you get so big
eating food of this kind?

449
00:48:17,706 --> 00:48:20,012
Listen, friend, we didn't mean
to land in that puddle.

450
00:48:20,043 --> 00:48:22,695
If we could get our ship out, we would.
But we can't.

451
00:48:22,711 --> 00:48:24,887
Aw, cannot get your ship out.

452
00:48:24,922 --> 00:48:26,663
Get out of there.

453
00:48:29,844 --> 00:48:32,235
Hey, you could have broken this.

454
00:48:33,766 --> 00:48:35,896
Don't do that.

455
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:47,032
You're making a mess.

456
00:48:48,447 --> 00:48:50,577
Hey, give me that.

457
00:48:50,615 --> 00:48:53,268
Mine, or I will help you not.

458
00:48:53,286 --> 00:48:55,373
I don't want your help.
I want my lamp back.

459
00:48:55,413 --> 00:48:58,284
I'm gonna need it to get out of
this slimy mud-hole.

460
00:48:58,291 --> 00:49:00,509
Mud-hole? Slimy?
My home this is.

461
00:49:04,295 --> 00:49:05,775
R2, let him have it.

462
00:49:08,425 --> 00:49:11,253
- Mine! Mine! Mine!
- R2.

463
00:49:15,057 --> 00:49:18,579
Will you move along, little fella?
We got a lot of work to do.

464
00:49:19,519 --> 00:49:22,869
Stay and help you I will.
Find your friend.

465
00:49:23,608 --> 00:49:26,608
I'm not looking for a friend.
I'm looking for a Jedi master.

466
00:49:28,612 --> 00:49:31,092
Jedi master. Yoda.

467
00:49:31,115 --> 00:49:33,811
- You seek Yoda.
- You know him?

468
00:49:35,494 --> 00:49:37,626
Take you to him I will.

469
00:49:38,789 --> 00:49:42,043
Yes, yes, but now we must eat.

470
00:49:42,043 --> 00:49:44,827
Come.
Good food. Come.

471
00:49:54,514 --> 00:49:56,210
Come, come.

472
00:49:58,353 --> 00:49:59,483
R2...

473
00:50:00,311 --> 00:50:02,659
stay and watch after the camp.

474
00:50:16,119 --> 00:50:18,250
Where is R2 when I need him?

475
00:50:18,289 --> 00:50:21,072
Sir, I don't know where your ship
learned to communicate...

476
00:50:21,083 --> 00:50:23,083
but it has the most peculiar dialect.

477
00:50:23,126 --> 00:50:26,755
I believe it says the power coupling
on the negative axis has been polarized.

478
00:50:26,755 --> 00:50:29,320
I'm afraid you'll have to replace it.

479
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:32,650
Well, of course
I'll have to replace it.

480
00:50:33,804 --> 00:50:36,110
Here. And, Chewie...

481
00:50:37,684 --> 00:50:40,467
I think we better replace
the negative power coupling.

482
00:51:02,751 --> 00:51:05,534
Hey, Your Worship,
I'm only trying to help.

483
00:51:05,545 --> 00:51:08,112
Would you please
stop calling me that?

484
00:51:08,132 --> 00:51:10,175
Sure, Leia.

485
00:51:10,217 --> 00:51:13,782
- You make it so difficult sometimes.
- I do. I really do.

486
00:51:14,722 --> 00:51:17,070
You could be a little nicer though.

487
00:51:17,099 --> 00:51:19,882
Admit it.
Sometimes you think I'm all right.

488
00:51:22,146 --> 00:51:24,494
Occasionally, maybe...

489
00:51:24,521 --> 00:51:27,088
when you aren't acting
like a scoundrel.

490
00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:28,588
Scoundrel?

491
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:34,273
I like the sound of that.

492
00:51:35,284 --> 00:51:38,197
- Stop that.
- Stop what?

493
00:51:38,204 --> 00:51:40,465
Stop that.
My hands are dirty.

494
00:51:40,496 --> 00:51:42,759
My hands are dirty too.
What are you afraid of?

495
00:51:42,791 --> 00:51:45,010
- Afraid?
- You're trembling.

496
00:51:45,878 --> 00:51:48,052
I'm not trembling.

497
00:51:49,423 --> 00:51:51,989
You like me because I'm a scoundrel.

498
00:51:52,009 --> 00:51:54,532
There aren't enough
scoundrels in your life.

499
00:51:54,554 --> 00:51:56,684
I happen to like nice men.

500
00:51:56,722 --> 00:51:59,505
- I'm a nice man.
- No, you're not.

501
00:52:02,313 --> 00:52:03,356
Sir, sir!

502
00:52:03,438 --> 00:52:06,438
I've isolated
the reverse power flux coupling.

503
00:52:08,568 --> 00:52:09,829
Thank you.

504
00:52:09,902 --> 00:52:12,990
- Thank you very much.
- You're perfectly welcome, sir.

505
00:52:18,954 --> 00:52:22,206
That, Lord Vader, was the last time
they appeared in any of our scopes.

506
00:52:22,206 --> 00:52:25,251
Considering the damage we've sustained,
they must have been destroyed.

507
00:52:25,251 --> 00:52:28,670
No, Captain, they're alive.

508
00:52:28,672 --> 00:52:33,195
I want every ship available to sweep
the asteroid field until they are found.

509
00:52:37,556 --> 00:52:40,976
- Lord Vader.
- Yes, Admiral. What is it?

510
00:52:40,976 --> 00:52:43,324
The emperor commands you
to make contact with him.

511
00:52:43,353 --> 00:52:45,615
Move the ship out of
the asteroid field...

512
00:52:45,648 --> 00:52:47,996
so that we can send
a clear transmission.

513
00:52:48,025 --> 00:52:49,721
Yes, my lord.

514
00:53:06,251 --> 00:53:08,905
What is thy bidding, my master?

515
00:53:08,989 --> 00:53:13,208
There is a great disturbance
in the Force.

516
00:53:12,711 --> 00:53:15,146
I have felt it.

517
00:53:15,170 --> 00:53:17,824
We have a new enemy...

518
00:53:17,842 --> 00:53:21,369
Luke Skywalker.

519
00:53:21,447 --> 00:53:24,012
He could destroy us.

520
00:53:24,032 --> 00:53:26,206
He's just a boy.

521
00:53:26,244 --> 00:53:28,809
Obi-Wan can no longer help him.

522
00:53:28,829 --> 00:53:32,570
The Force is strong with him.

523
00:53:32,592 --> 00:53:37,637
The son of Skywalker
must not become a Jedi.

524
00:53:37,639 --> 00:53:39,900
If he could be turned...

525
00:53:39,934 --> 00:53:42,891
he would become a powerful ally.

526
00:53:43,811 --> 00:53:45,596
Yes.

527
00:53:46,398 --> 00:53:50,077
He would be a great asset.

528
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:52,425
Can it be done?

529
00:53:52,454 --> 00:53:56,585
He will join us or die, master.

530
00:54:11,659 --> 00:54:15,706
I'm sure it's delicious. I just don't
understand why we can't see Yoda now.

531
00:54:15,706 --> 00:54:19,663
Patience. For the Jedi,
it is time to eat as well.

532
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:24,965
Eat. Eat.

533
00:54:25,757 --> 00:54:27,148
Hot.

534
00:54:34,849 --> 00:54:36,893
Good food. Good.

535
00:54:36,934 --> 00:54:39,980
How far away is Yoda?
Will it take us long to get there?

536
00:54:39,981 --> 00:54:42,329
Not far. Yoda not far.

537
00:54:42,356 --> 00:54:45,228
Patience.
Soon you will be with him.

538
00:54:47,528 --> 00:54:50,313
Root leaf. I cook.

539
00:54:52,034 --> 00:54:54,601
Why wish you become Jedi?

540
00:54:55,579 --> 00:54:58,364
Mostly 'cause of my father, I guess.

541
00:54:58,373 --> 00:55:01,592
Father.
Powerful Jedi was he.

542
00:55:02,961 --> 00:55:04,789
- Powerful Jedi.
- Oh, come on.

543
00:55:05,590 --> 00:55:08,460
How could you know my father?
You don't even know who I am.

544
00:55:08,467 --> 00:55:12,121
I don't even know what I'm doing here.
We're wasting our time!

545
00:55:13,389 --> 00:55:15,780
I cannot teach him.

546
00:55:15,809 --> 00:55:17,938
The boy has no patience.

547
00:55:17,976 --> 00:55:20,326
He will learn patience.

548
00:55:25,068 --> 00:55:27,545
Much anger in him...

549
00:55:27,570 --> 00:55:29,483
like his father.

550
00:55:29,530 --> 00:55:33,402
Was I any different
when you taught me?

551
00:55:34,619 --> 00:55:35,619
No.

552
00:55:36,539 --> 00:55:39,887
- He is not ready.
- Yoda.

553
00:55:42,878 --> 00:55:44,791
I am ready.

554
00:55:44,838 --> 00:55:48,342
I can be a Jedi.
Ben, tell him I'm...

555
00:55:48,376 --> 00:55:51,844
Ready, are you?
What know you ready?

556
00:55:51,846 --> 00:55:55,931
For 800 years have I trained Jedi.

557
00:55:55,932 --> 00:55:59,847
My own counsel will I keep
on who is to be trained.

558
00:56:01,646 --> 00:56:05,568
AJedi must have
the deepest commitment...

559
00:56:05,568 --> 00:56:07,481
the most serious mind.

560
00:56:09,405 --> 00:56:12,623
This one a long time have I watched.

561
00:56:13,576 --> 00:56:16,445
All his life
has he looked away...

562
00:56:16,454 --> 00:56:19,623
to the future,
to the horizon.

563
00:56:19,623 --> 00:56:23,322
Never his mind on where he was...

564
00:56:24,503 --> 00:56:26,634
what he was doing.

565
00:56:28,257 --> 00:56:29,302
Adventure.

566
00:56:30,634 --> 00:56:32,331
Excitement.

567
00:56:32,387 --> 00:56:34,735
AJedi craves not these things.

568
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:37,469
You are reckless.

569
00:56:37,518 --> 00:56:40,603
So was I, if you remember.

570
00:56:40,603 --> 00:56:42,735
He is too old.

571
00:56:44,648 --> 00:56:46,911
Yes, too old to begin the training.

572
00:56:46,943 --> 00:56:48,943
But I've learned so much.

573
00:56:56,702 --> 00:57:00,094
- Will he finish what he begins?
- I won't fail you.

574
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:03,239
I'm not afraid.

575
00:57:07,672 --> 00:57:09,802
You will be.

576
00:57:10,885 --> 00:57:13,016
You will be.

577
00:57:55,012 --> 00:57:58,641
- Sir, if I may venture an opinion...
- I'm not interested in your opinion.

578
00:57:58,643 --> 00:58:00,730
There's something out there.

579
00:58:00,769 --> 00:58:02,813
- Where?
- Outside in the cave.

580
00:58:04,438 --> 00:58:06,003
There it is. Listen!

581
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:08,023
- I'm going out there.
- Are you crazy?

582
00:58:08,068 --> 00:58:10,721
I just got this bucket together.
I won't let it get torn apart.

583
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:12,956
Then I'm going with you.

584
00:58:14,117 --> 00:58:17,326
I think it might be better
if I stay behind and guard the ship.

585
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:18,369
Oh, no.

586
00:58:33,427 --> 00:58:35,559
This ground sure feels strange.

587
00:58:37,097 --> 00:58:39,230
It doesn't feel like rock.

588
00:58:43,646 --> 00:58:46,342
There's an awful lot
of moisture in here.

589
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:50,193
I don't know.
I have a bad feeling about this.

590
00:58:50,195 --> 00:58:51,456
Yeah.

591
00:58:53,489 --> 00:58:54,445
Watch out!

592
00:58:55,534 --> 00:58:58,099
It's all right. It's all right.

593
00:58:58,119 --> 00:59:00,684
Yeah, that's what I thought... mynock.

594
00:59:00,704 --> 00:59:03,956
Chewie, check the rest of the ship and
make sure there are no more attached...

595
00:59:03,958 --> 00:59:05,916
chewing on the power cables.

596
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:07,612
Mynocks?

597
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:09,976
Go inside. We'll clean them off
if there are any more.

598
00:59:19,056 --> 00:59:21,623
Go away!
Go away, beastly thing! Shoo!

599
00:59:28,818 --> 00:59:30,731
Wait a minute.

600
00:59:52,384 --> 00:59:55,927
- Chewie, let's get out of here!
- The Empire is still out there!

601
00:59:55,927 --> 00:59:58,059
No time to discuss this
in committee!

602
00:59:58,722 --> 01:00:00,853
I am not a committee!

603
01:00:06,231 --> 01:00:09,188
You can't make the jump to light speed
in this asteroid field.

604
01:00:09,192 --> 01:00:11,757
Sit down, sweetheart.
We're taking off.

605
01:00:16,449 --> 01:00:17,840
- Look!
- I see it.

606
01:00:17,909 --> 01:00:20,389
- We're doomed!
- The cave is collapsing.

607
01:00:20,413 --> 01:00:22,369
- This is no cave.
- What?

608
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:56,215
Yes, run.

609
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:57,889
Yes.

610
01:00:57,949 --> 01:01:01,411
A Jedi's strength
flows from the Force.

611
01:01:01,413 --> 01:01:04,956
But beware of the dark side.
Anger, fear, aggression...

612
01:01:04,956 --> 01:01:07,219
The dark side
of the Force are they.

613
01:01:07,251 --> 01:01:10,961
Easily they flow,
quick to join you in a fight.

614
01:01:10,963 --> 01:01:13,268
If once you start down
the dark path...

615
01:01:13,298 --> 01:01:15,690
forever will it dominate
your destiny.

616
01:01:15,717 --> 01:01:19,804
Consume you it will,
as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice.

617
01:01:19,806 --> 01:01:21,719
Vader.

618
01:01:21,766 --> 01:01:24,983
- Is the dark side stronger?
- No, no.

619
01:01:26,605 --> 01:01:28,648
Quicker, easier, more seductive.

620
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:31,615
How am I to know
the good side from the bad?

621
01:01:31,652 --> 01:01:34,000
You will know...

622
01:01:34,028 --> 01:01:36,376
when you are calm,
at peace...

623
01:01:37,365 --> 01:01:38,844
passive.

624
01:01:39,867 --> 01:01:44,163
A Jedi uses the Force
for knowledge and defence...

625
01:01:44,164 --> 01:01:46,077
never for attack.

626
01:01:46,126 --> 01:01:49,876
- But tell me why I can't...
- No. There is no why.

627
01:01:49,878 --> 01:01:52,748
Nothing more
will I teach you today.

628
01:01:52,755 --> 01:01:54,800
Clear your mind of questions.

629
01:02:17,822 --> 01:02:19,867
There's something not right here.

630
01:02:23,663 --> 01:02:25,141
I feel cold.

631
01:02:25,956 --> 01:02:27,565
- Death.
- That place...

632
01:02:28,626 --> 01:02:32,253
is strong with
the dark side of the Force.

633
01:02:32,255 --> 01:02:34,255
A domain of evil it is.

634
01:02:35,634 --> 01:02:37,635
In you must go.

635
01:02:38,762 --> 01:02:40,023
What's in there?

636
01:02:42,724 --> 01:02:45,115
Only what you take with you.

637
01:02:48,813 --> 01:02:50,076
Your weapons...

638
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:52,420
you will not need them.

639
01:05:32,606 --> 01:05:35,172
Bounty hunters.
We don't need their scum.

640
01:05:35,192 --> 01:05:38,063
- Yes, sir.
- Those rebels won't escape us.

641
01:05:43,659 --> 01:05:47,079
Sir, we have a priority signal
from the Stardestroyer Avenger.

642
01:05:47,079 --> 01:05:48,688
Right.

643
01:05:48,748 --> 01:05:54,670
There will be a substantial reward for
the one who finds the Millennium Falcon.

644
01:05:54,670 --> 01:05:57,840
You are free to use
any methods necessary...

645
01:05:57,842 --> 01:06:00,059
but I want them alive.

646
01:06:00,092 --> 01:06:02,614
No disintegrations.

647
01:06:02,635 --> 01:06:04,550
- As you wish.
- Lord Vader.

648
01:06:06,766 --> 01:06:08,768
My lord, we have them.

649
01:06:13,148 --> 01:06:16,365
Thank goodness
we're coming out of the asteroid field.

650
01:06:21,489 --> 01:06:24,186
Let's get out of here.
Ready for light speed?

651
01:06:24,199 --> 01:06:26,505
One, two...

652
01:06:26,536 --> 01:06:27,710
three!

653
01:06:34,295 --> 01:06:36,643
It's not fair.

654
01:06:38,132 --> 01:06:41,045
Transfer circuits aren't working.
It's not my fault.

655
01:06:41,050 --> 01:06:44,094
- No light speed?
- It's not my fault.

656
01:06:48,768 --> 01:06:50,856
Sir, we just lost
the main rear deflector shield.

657
01:06:50,896 --> 01:06:53,244
One more direct hit
on the back quarter and we're done for.

658
01:06:53,271 --> 01:06:55,054
Turn her around.

659
01:06:55,108 --> 01:06:57,847
Turn her around! I'm gonna
put all power in the front shield.

660
01:06:57,860 --> 01:06:59,947
- You're gonna attack?
- The odds of surviving...

661
01:06:59,987 --> 01:07:01,989
a direct assault
on an imperial Stardestroyer...

662
01:07:02,030 --> 01:07:04,030
Shut up!

663
01:07:10,456 --> 01:07:12,500
They're moving to attack position.

664
01:07:14,628 --> 01:07:15,757
Shields up.

665
01:07:22,302 --> 01:07:24,998
Track them. They may
come around for another pass.

666
01:07:25,012 --> 01:07:27,490
Captain Needa, the ship no longer
appears on our scopes.

667
01:07:27,516 --> 01:07:31,268
They can't have disappeared. No ship
that small has a cloaking device.

668
01:07:31,268 --> 01:07:35,271
- There's no trace of them.
- Captain, Lord Vader demands an update.

669
01:07:38,110 --> 01:07:40,239
Get a shuttle ready.

670
01:07:40,277 --> 01:07:44,322
I shall assume full responsibility for
losing them and apologize to Lord Vader.

671
01:07:44,324 --> 01:07:47,541
- Meanwhile, continue to scan the area.
- Yes, Captain Needa.

672
01:07:52,123 --> 01:07:54,472
Use the Force.

673
01:07:54,501 --> 01:07:55,545
Yes.

674
01:08:01,134 --> 01:08:02,960
Now, the stone.

675
01:08:07,054 --> 01:08:08,751
Feel it.

676
01:08:20,402 --> 01:08:22,271
Concentrate!

677
01:08:36,877 --> 01:08:40,046
Oh, no.
We'll never get it out now.

678
01:08:40,047 --> 01:08:41,832
So certain are you.

679
01:08:45,846 --> 01:08:49,194
Always with you
it cannot be done.

680
01:08:50,309 --> 01:08:52,351
Hear you nothing that I say?

681
01:08:52,394 --> 01:08:54,569
Master, moving stones
around is one thing.

682
01:08:54,604 --> 01:08:56,518
This is totally different.

683
01:08:56,564 --> 01:08:58,912
No. No different.

684
01:08:58,942 --> 01:09:01,118
Only different in your mind.

685
01:09:01,154 --> 01:09:04,501
You must unlearn
what you have learned.

686
01:09:05,740 --> 01:09:08,958
- All right. I'll give it a try.
- Try not.

687
01:09:09,703 --> 01:09:11,181
Do...

688
01:09:11,247 --> 01:09:12,899
or do not.

689
01:09:12,957 --> 01:09:14,697
There is no try.

690
01:10:03,257 --> 01:10:06,301
I can't. It's too big.

691
01:10:06,302 --> 01:10:08,435
Size matters not.

692
01:10:08,471 --> 01:10:11,603
Look at me.
Judge me by my size, do you?

693
01:10:14,226 --> 01:10:17,228
And well you should not...

694
01:10:17,230 --> 01:10:19,971
for my ally is the Force.

695
01:10:19,984 --> 01:10:22,462
And a powerful ally it is.

696
01:10:23,445 --> 01:10:25,925
Life creates it...

697
01:10:25,948 --> 01:10:28,078
makes it grow.

698
01:10:28,868 --> 01:10:31,782
Its energy surrounds us...

699
01:10:32,706 --> 01:10:34,574
and binds us.

700
01:10:34,622 --> 01:10:37,972
Luminous beings are we,
not this crude matter.

701
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:42,311
You must feel
the Force around you.

702
01:10:43,048 --> 01:10:45,744
Here, between you, me...

703
01:10:46,511 --> 01:10:48,859
the tree, the rock...

704
01:10:48,889 --> 01:10:51,063
everywhere.

705
01:10:51,099 --> 01:10:52,577
Yes...

706
01:10:52,641 --> 01:10:56,599
even between
the land and the ship.

707
01:11:01,359 --> 01:11:03,708
You want the impossible.

708
01:12:51,137 --> 01:12:53,269
I don't believe it.

709
01:12:55,185 --> 01:12:57,967
That is why you fail.

710
01:13:17,122 --> 01:13:20,514
Apology accepted,
Captain Needa.

711
01:13:28,885 --> 01:13:32,055
Lord Vader, our ships have completed
their scan and found nothing.

712
01:13:32,055 --> 01:13:34,099
If the Millennium Falcon
went into light speed...

713
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:36,140
it'll be on the other side
of the galaxy now.

714
01:13:36,185 --> 01:13:38,097
Alert all commands.

715
01:13:38,145 --> 01:13:42,524
Calculate every possible destination
along their last known trajectory.

716
01:13:42,524 --> 01:13:46,046
- Yes, my lord. We'll find them.
- Don't fail me again...

717
01:13:46,862 --> 01:13:48,948
Admiral.

718
01:13:51,033 --> 01:13:54,467
Alert all commands.
Deploy the fleet.

719
01:14:09,342 --> 01:14:12,636
Captain Solo,
this time you have gone too far.

720
01:14:12,637 --> 01:14:15,849
I will not be quiet, Chewbacca.
Why doesn't anyone listen to me?

721
01:14:15,850 --> 01:14:17,979
The fleet's beginning to break up.

722
01:14:18,019 --> 01:14:21,020
Go stand by the manual release
for the landing claw.

723
01:14:23,233 --> 01:14:25,319
I really don't see
how that's going to help.

724
01:14:25,359 --> 01:14:28,945
Surrender is a perfectly acceptable
alternative in extreme circumstances.

725
01:14:28,947 --> 01:14:31,121
The Empire may be
gracious enough...

726
01:14:31,158 --> 01:14:33,680
- Thank you.
- What did you have in mind next?

727
01:14:33,702 --> 01:14:35,702
If they follow standard
imperial procedure...

728
01:14:35,744 --> 01:14:38,094
they'll dump their garbage
before they go to light speed.

729
01:14:38,122 --> 01:14:41,248
- Then we just float away.
- With the rest of the garbage.

730
01:14:41,250 --> 01:14:42,729
Then what?

731
01:14:42,793 --> 01:14:46,171
Then we gotta find a safe port
somewhere around here.

732
01:14:46,172 --> 01:14:47,608
Any ideas?

733
01:14:47,675 --> 01:14:50,153
- Where are we?
- The Anoat system.

734
01:14:50,176 --> 01:14:52,872
The Anoat system.
There's not much there.

735
01:14:52,887 --> 01:14:55,845
Oh, wait.
This is interesting.

736
01:14:55,849 --> 01:14:58,850
- Lando.
- Lando system?

737
01:14:58,851 --> 01:15:02,563
Lando's not a system.
He's a man. Lando Calrissian.

738
01:15:02,564 --> 01:15:04,912
Card player, gambler.

739
01:15:04,942 --> 01:15:07,636
- A scoundrel. You'd like him.
- Thanks.

740
01:15:07,652 --> 01:15:10,435
Bespin. It's pretty far,
but I think we can make it.

741
01:15:11,823 --> 01:15:14,998
- A mining colony?
- Yeah, a tibanna gas mine.

742
01:15:15,744 --> 01:15:17,962
Lando conned somebody out of it.

743
01:15:17,997 --> 01:15:20,823
We go back a long way,
Lando and me.

744
01:15:22,125 --> 01:15:24,908
- Can you trust him?
- No.

745
01:15:24,921 --> 01:15:27,921
But he's got no love for the Empire.
I can tell you that.

746
01:15:28,882 --> 01:15:31,623
Here we go, Chewie.
Stand by. Detach.

747
01:15:38,725 --> 01:15:40,335
You do have your moments.

748
01:15:41,145 --> 01:15:44,101
Not many of them,
but you do have them.

749
01:16:18,766 --> 01:16:20,768
Concentrate.

750
01:16:20,810 --> 01:16:24,146
Feel the Force flow.

751
01:16:24,148 --> 01:16:25,844
Yes.

752
01:16:33,448 --> 01:16:35,189
Good.

753
01:16:35,243 --> 01:16:36,677
Calm.

754
01:16:36,743 --> 01:16:38,135
Yes.

755
01:16:39,037 --> 01:16:41,690
Through the Force,
things you will see.

756
01:16:41,707 --> 01:16:45,292
Other places.
The future. The past.

757
01:16:45,293 --> 01:16:47,815
Old friends long gone.

758
01:16:58,225 --> 01:16:59,746
Control, control.

759
01:16:59,809 --> 01:17:02,114
You must learn control.

760
01:17:05,064 --> 01:17:08,109
I saw a city in the clouds.

761
01:17:10,069 --> 01:17:12,331
Friends you have there.

762
01:17:13,323 --> 01:17:17,105
- They were in pain.
- It is the future you see.

763
01:17:18,161 --> 01:17:19,204
Future?

764
01:17:28,171 --> 01:17:29,649
Will they die?

765
01:17:32,842 --> 01:17:35,019
Difficult to see.

766
01:17:35,054 --> 01:17:37,619
Always in motion is the future.

767
01:17:40,016 --> 01:17:41,494
I've gotta go to them.

768
01:17:43,436 --> 01:17:46,606
Decide you must
how to serve them best.

769
01:17:46,608 --> 01:17:49,609
If you leave now,
help them you could...

770
01:17:50,569 --> 01:17:54,266
but you would destroy all
for which they have fought and suffered.

771
01:18:08,171 --> 01:18:11,085
No, I don't have a landing permit.

772
01:18:11,090 --> 01:18:14,844
I'm trying to reach Lando Calrissian.

773
01:18:14,845 --> 01:18:17,063
Wait a minute!
Let me explain!

774
01:18:17,096 --> 01:18:19,140
You will not deviate
from your present course.

775
01:18:19,181 --> 01:18:22,009
- Rather touchy, aren't they?
- I thought you knew this person.

776
01:18:24,813 --> 01:18:27,725
That was a long time ago.
I'm sure he's forgotten about that.

777
01:18:36,199 --> 01:18:39,952
Permission granted to land
on Platform 327.

778
01:18:39,953 --> 01:18:41,387
Thank you.

779
01:18:42,247 --> 01:18:45,248
Nothing to worry about.
We go way back, Lando and me.

780
01:18:45,251 --> 01:18:46,989
Who's worried?

781
01:19:35,761 --> 01:19:37,238
No one to meet us.

782
01:19:38,596 --> 01:19:41,033
I don't like this.

783
01:19:41,057 --> 01:19:44,015
- What would you like?
- They did let us land.

784
01:19:44,019 --> 01:19:46,845
Look, don't worry.
Everything's gonna be fine.

785
01:19:46,855 --> 01:19:48,551
Trust me.

786
01:19:53,237 --> 01:19:55,368
See? My friend.

787
01:19:59,702 --> 01:20:01,832
Keep your eyes open.

788
01:20:04,456 --> 01:20:06,153
Hey.

789
01:20:06,207 --> 01:20:10,420
Why, you slimy, double-crossing,
no-good swindler.

790
01:20:10,421 --> 01:20:14,814
You've got a lot of guts coming here,
after what you pulled.

791
01:20:25,145 --> 01:20:28,729
How you doin', you old pirate?
So good to see you!

792
01:20:28,730 --> 01:20:31,899
- I never thought I'd see you again.
- Well, he seems very friendly.

793
01:20:31,899 --> 01:20:35,112
Yes. Very friendly.

794
01:20:35,113 --> 01:20:36,809
What are you doing here?

795
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:38,952
Repairs. I thought
you could help me out.

796
01:20:38,992 --> 01:20:41,730
- What have you done to my ship?
- Your ship?

797
01:20:41,744 --> 01:20:45,442
Hey, remember,
you lost her to me fair and square.

798
01:20:46,166 --> 01:20:47,600
How you doin', Chewbacca?

799
01:20:48,501 --> 01:20:51,284
Still hanging around with this loser?

800
01:20:53,172 --> 01:20:55,608
Hello.
What have we here?

801
01:20:57,011 --> 01:21:00,679
Welcome. I'm Lando Calrissian.
I'm the administrator of this facility.

802
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:03,725
- And who might you be?
- Leia.

803
01:21:03,725 --> 01:21:05,421
Welcome, Leia.

804
01:21:08,189 --> 01:21:11,145
All right, all right.
You old smoothie.

805
01:21:11,149 --> 01:21:14,902
Hello, sir. I am C-3PO,
human-cyborg relations.

806
01:21:14,903 --> 01:21:17,817
My facilities are at your...
Well, really!

807
01:21:17,823 --> 01:21:20,302
- What's wrong with the Falcon?
- Hyperdrive.

808
01:21:20,327 --> 01:21:22,457
- I'll get my people to work on her.
- Good.

809
01:21:22,496 --> 01:21:24,626
That ship saved my life
quite a few times.

810
01:21:24,662 --> 01:21:27,315
She's the fastest
hunk of junk in the galaxy.

811
01:21:28,542 --> 01:21:31,109
How's the gas mine?
Still paying off for you?

812
01:21:31,128 --> 01:21:35,090
Not as well as I'd like. We're a small
outpost and not very self-sufficient.

813
01:21:35,091 --> 01:21:38,301
I've had supply problems
of every kind.

814
01:21:38,302 --> 01:21:40,563
I've had labour difficulties.

815
01:21:40,596 --> 01:21:43,972
- What's so funny?
- You. Listen to you.

816
01:21:43,974 --> 01:21:46,889
You sound like a businessman,
a responsible leader.

817
01:21:46,895 --> 01:21:48,851
Who'd have thought that, huh?

818
01:21:48,896 --> 01:21:51,942
Seeing you sure brings back
a few things.

819
01:21:51,976 --> 01:21:53,203
Yeah.

820
01:21:53,277 --> 01:21:55,493
Yeah, I'm responsible these days.

821
01:21:56,279 --> 01:21:59,063
It's the price you pay
for being successful.

822
01:22:02,203 --> 01:22:04,333
Nice to see a familiar face.

823
01:22:04,371 --> 01:22:06,067
How rude!

824
01:22:07,582 --> 01:22:09,712
That sounds like
an R2 unit in there.

825
01:22:09,751 --> 01:22:11,404
I wonder if... Hello?

826
01:22:13,587 --> 01:22:15,198
How interesting.

827
01:22:15,257 --> 01:22:18,466
- Who are you?
- Oh, my. I'm terribly sorry.

828
01:22:18,467 --> 01:22:20,600
I didn't mean to intrude.
Please don't get up.

829
01:22:38,989 --> 01:22:41,685
Luke, you must complete the training.

830
01:22:42,659 --> 01:22:45,574
I can't keep the vision out of my head.
I've gotta help them.

831
01:22:45,579 --> 01:22:47,797
You must not go.

832
01:22:47,832 --> 01:22:51,048
- But Han and Leia will die if I don't.
- You don't know that.

833
01:22:53,921 --> 01:22:56,704
Even Yoda cannot see their fate.

834
01:22:56,716 --> 01:22:59,587
But I can help them.
I feel the Force.

835
01:22:59,594 --> 01:23:01,854
But you cannot control it.

836
01:23:01,971 --> 01:23:04,407
This is a dangerous time for you...

837
01:23:04,431 --> 01:23:07,559
when you will be tempted
by the dark side of the Force.

838
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:10,908
Yes, yes.
To Obi-Wan you listen.

839
01:23:11,648 --> 01:23:13,126
The cave.

840
01:23:13,192 --> 01:23:15,365
Remember your failure at the cave.

841
01:23:15,403 --> 01:23:17,404
But I've learned
so much since then.

842
01:23:17,445 --> 01:23:20,228
Master Yoda, I promise to return
and finish what I've begun.

843
01:23:20,239 --> 01:23:22,284
You have my word.

844
01:23:22,324 --> 01:23:25,238
It is you and your abilities
the emperor wants.

845
01:23:25,244 --> 01:23:28,072
That is why your friends
are made to suffer.

846
01:23:29,416 --> 01:23:32,198
That's why I have to go.

847
01:23:32,212 --> 01:23:36,672
Luke, I don't want to lose you
to the emperor the way I lost Vader.

848
01:23:36,673 --> 01:23:38,239
You won't.

849
01:23:39,135 --> 01:23:42,787
Stopped they must be.
On this all depends.

850
01:23:43,515 --> 01:23:47,100
Only a fully trained Jedi knight,
with the Force as his ally...

851
01:23:47,100 --> 01:23:49,796
will conquer Vader
and his emperor.

852
01:23:49,811 --> 01:23:51,985
If you end your training now...

853
01:23:52,023 --> 01:23:56,443
if you choose the quick and easy path,
as Vader did...

854
01:23:56,444 --> 01:23:59,185
you will become an agent of evil.

855
01:23:59,197 --> 01:24:00,197
Patience.

856
01:24:01,115 --> 01:24:05,618
- And sacrifice Han and Leia?
- If you honour what they fight for...

857
01:24:05,619 --> 01:24:06,663
yes.

858
01:24:06,746 --> 01:24:09,957
If you choose to face Vader,
you will do it alone.

859
01:24:09,957 --> 01:24:12,046
I cannot interfere.

860
01:24:14,046 --> 01:24:15,306
I understand.

861
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:23,675
R2, fire up the converters.

862
01:24:28,935 --> 01:24:30,979
Don't give in to hate.

863
01:24:31,020 --> 01:24:33,890
That leads to the dark side.

864
01:24:33,899 --> 01:24:35,681
Strong is Vader.

865
01:24:35,734 --> 01:24:38,344
Mind what you have learned.
Save you it can.

866
01:24:39,195 --> 01:24:40,761
I will.

867
01:24:40,823 --> 01:24:43,389
And I'll return. I promise.

868
01:24:50,373 --> 01:24:53,542
Told you, I did.
Reckless is he.

869
01:24:53,543 --> 01:24:55,197
Now...

870
01:24:55,253 --> 01:24:57,079
matters are worse.

871
01:24:57,131 --> 01:24:59,262
That boy is our last hope.

872
01:24:59,300 --> 01:25:02,344
No, there is another.

873
01:25:34,377 --> 01:25:37,796
The ship's almost finished. Two or three
more things and we're in great shape.

874
01:25:37,798 --> 01:25:39,927
The sooner the better.
Something's wrong here.

875
01:25:39,965 --> 01:25:42,096
No one has seen or knows
anything about 3PO.

876
01:25:42,135 --> 01:25:44,440
He's been gone too long
to have gotten lost.

877
01:25:44,470 --> 01:25:46,253
Relax.

878
01:25:46,305 --> 01:25:49,306
I'll talk to Lando
and see what I can find out.

879
01:25:49,309 --> 01:25:51,876
I don't trust Lando.

880
01:25:51,895 --> 01:25:55,355
Well, I don't trust him either,
but he is my friend.

881
01:25:55,356 --> 01:25:58,140
Besides, we'll soon be gone.

882
01:25:59,487 --> 01:26:01,618
Then you're as good as gone,
aren't you?

883
01:26:36,565 --> 01:26:38,131
What happened?

884
01:26:39,153 --> 01:26:39,847
Where?

885
01:26:41,988 --> 01:26:44,077
Found him in a junk pile?

886
01:26:44,114 --> 01:26:46,768
What a mess.
Chewie, you think you can repair him?

887
01:26:48,828 --> 01:26:52,480
- Lando's got people that can fix him.
- No, thanks.

888
01:26:53,917 --> 01:26:55,831
I'm sorry.
Am I interrupting anything?

889
01:26:56,712 --> 01:26:57,886
Not really.

890
01:27:01,382 --> 01:27:03,470
You look absolutely beautiful.

891
01:27:03,510 --> 01:27:06,929
You truly belong here
with us among the clouds.

892
01:27:06,930 --> 01:27:08,452
Thank you.

893
01:27:08,515 --> 01:27:11,560
Would you join me
for a little refreshment?

894
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:14,474
Everyone's invited, of course.

895
01:27:14,479 --> 01:27:16,654
Having trouble with your droid?

896
01:27:16,690 --> 01:27:19,430
No. No problem. Why?

897
01:27:28,161 --> 01:27:30,770
You see, since we're
a small operation...

898
01:27:30,788 --> 01:27:34,164
we don't fall into
the jurisdiction of the Empire.

899
01:27:34,166 --> 01:27:36,819
- So you're part of the Mining Guild?
- No, not actually.

900
01:27:36,836 --> 01:27:39,097
Our operation is small enough
not to be noticed.

901
01:27:39,130 --> 01:27:41,261
Which is advantageous
for everybody...

902
01:27:41,298 --> 01:27:45,844
since our customers are anxious to avoid
attracting attention to themselves.

903
01:27:45,845 --> 01:27:49,847
Aren't you afraid the Empire's
gonna find out, shut you down?

904
01:27:49,849 --> 01:27:53,269
It's been a danger that looms like
a shadow over everything we've built.

905
01:27:53,270 --> 01:27:56,095
But things have developed
that'll ensure security.

906
01:27:56,106 --> 01:27:59,541
I've just made a deal that'll keep
the Empire out of here forever.

907
01:28:09,119 --> 01:28:12,033
We would be honoured
if you would join us.

908
01:28:18,796 --> 01:28:21,274
I had no choice.
They arrived right before you did.

909
01:28:22,132 --> 01:28:23,872
I'm sorry.

910
01:28:27,304 --> 01:28:28,695
I'm sorry too.

911
01:28:43,487 --> 01:28:44,922
No, 3PO's with them.

912
01:28:46,282 --> 01:28:48,456
Just hang on.
We're almost there.

913
01:29:47,929 --> 01:29:50,494
I'm terribly sorry.
I didn't mean to intrude.

914
01:29:50,515 --> 01:29:52,557
No, please don't get up.

915
01:29:58,314 --> 01:30:01,818
Stormtroopers? Here?
We're in danger.

916
01:30:01,819 --> 01:30:04,514
I must tell the others.
Oh, no! I've been shot!

917
01:30:32,224 --> 01:30:33,920
Lord Vader.

918
01:30:33,975 --> 01:30:36,453
You may take Captain Solo
to Jabba the Hutt...

919
01:30:36,478 --> 01:30:38,564
after I have Skywalker.

920
01:30:38,604 --> 01:30:40,561
He's no good to me dead.

921
01:30:40,606 --> 01:30:44,042
He will not be
permanently damaged.

922
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:48,974
Lord Vader, what about Leia
and the Wookiee?

923
01:30:48,990 --> 01:30:51,818
They must never again leave this city.

924
01:30:51,827 --> 01:30:55,163
That wasn't part of our agreement, nor
was giving Han to this bounty hunter!

925
01:30:55,164 --> 01:30:59,252
Perhaps you think you're
being treated unfairly?

926
01:31:01,837 --> 01:31:02,881
No.

927
01:31:02,963 --> 01:31:06,659
Good. It would be unfortunate
if I had to leave a garrison here.

928
01:31:08,927 --> 01:31:11,408
This deal is getting worse
all the time.

929
01:31:12,515 --> 01:31:14,994
Oh, yes, that's very good.
I like that.

930
01:31:16,518 --> 01:31:19,171
Something's not right
because now I can't see.

931
01:31:21,608 --> 01:31:23,912
That's much better.

932
01:31:23,944 --> 01:31:25,640
Wait. Wait.

933
01:31:25,695 --> 01:31:27,827
Oh, my!
What have you done?

934
01:31:27,863 --> 01:31:29,472
I'm backwards!

935
01:31:29,533 --> 01:31:31,488
You flea-bitten furball!

936
01:31:31,533 --> 01:31:34,318
Only an overgrown mophead like you
would be stupid enough...

937
01:31:48,802 --> 01:31:50,846
I feel terrible.

938
01:32:06,028 --> 01:32:08,158
Why are they doing this?

939
01:32:10,574 --> 01:32:13,358
They never even asked me
any questions.

940
01:32:22,587 --> 01:32:24,849
- Get out of here, Lando.
- Shut up and listen.

941
01:32:24,881 --> 01:32:28,091
Vader's agreed
to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.

942
01:32:28,092 --> 01:32:30,050
They'll have to stay here,
but they'll be safe.

943
01:32:30,095 --> 01:32:32,313
- And Han?
- Vader's given him to the bounty hunter.

944
01:32:32,346 --> 01:32:34,869
- Vader wants us all dead.
- He doesn't want you at all.

945
01:32:34,890 --> 01:32:38,394
He's after somebody
called Skywalker.

946
01:32:38,395 --> 01:32:41,046
- Lord Vader set a trap for him.
- And we're the bait.

947
01:32:41,064 --> 01:32:42,976
- He's on his way.
- Perfect.

948
01:32:43,859 --> 01:32:46,163
You fixed us all real good,
didn't you?

949
01:32:46,194 --> 01:32:47,412
My friend.

950
01:32:50,365 --> 01:32:51,627
Stop!

951
01:32:52,868 --> 01:32:55,127
I've done all I can.

952
01:32:55,162 --> 01:32:57,684
Sorry I couldn't do better,
but I got my own problems.

953
01:32:57,706 --> 01:32:59,054
Yeah.

954
01:32:59,123 --> 01:33:01,037
You're a real hero.

955
01:33:11,761 --> 01:33:14,327
You certainly
have a way with people.

956
01:33:28,613 --> 01:33:30,525
This facility is crude...

957
01:33:30,573 --> 01:33:33,784
but it should be adequate
to freeze Skywalker...

958
01:33:33,786 --> 01:33:36,132
for his journey to the emperor.

959
01:33:36,161 --> 01:33:39,288
Lord Vader,
ship approaching, X-wing class.

960
01:33:39,289 --> 01:33:42,811
Good. Monitor Skywalker
and allow him to land.

961
01:33:44,212 --> 01:33:49,050
Lord Vader, we only use this facility
for carbon freezing. It might kill him.

962
01:33:49,051 --> 01:33:52,051
I do not want
the emperor's prize damaged.

963
01:33:52,052 --> 01:33:55,270
We will test it on Captain Solo.

964
01:34:18,913 --> 01:34:23,251
If you'd attached my legs I wouldn't
be in this ridiculous position.

965
01:34:23,252 --> 01:34:26,034
Now remember, Chewbacca,
you have a responsibility for me...

966
01:34:26,046 --> 01:34:27,829
so don't do anything foolish.

967
01:34:41,854 --> 01:34:43,984
What's going on, buddy?

968
01:34:44,858 --> 01:34:47,030
You're being put into carbon freeze.

969
01:34:47,067 --> 01:34:50,695
What if he doesn't survive?
He's worth a lot to me.

970
01:34:50,697 --> 01:34:54,220
The Empire will compensate you
if he dies. Put him in.

971
01:34:58,037 --> 01:34:59,255
Chewbacca, stop!

972
01:34:59,329 --> 01:35:01,417
No, Chewie, stop!

973
01:35:01,457 --> 01:35:04,585
You're going to get us all killed!
Yes, stop. I'm not ready to die.

974
01:35:04,586 --> 01:35:06,628
Hey! Hey!
Listen to me.

975
01:35:06,671 --> 01:35:09,280
Chewie, this won't help me.

976
01:35:09,300 --> 01:35:11,996
Hey, save your strength.
There'll be another time.

977
01:35:13,761 --> 01:35:15,457
The princess.

978
01:35:15,512 --> 01:35:17,340
You have to take care of her.

979
01:35:19,518 --> 01:35:21,604
Do you hear me?

980
01:35:35,408 --> 01:35:38,497
- I love you.
- I know.

981
01:36:07,567 --> 01:36:11,305
What's going on?
Turn round. I can't see.

982
01:37:10,046 --> 01:37:12,179
They've encased him in carbonite.

983
01:37:12,216 --> 01:37:14,172
He should be quite
well-protected...

984
01:37:14,217 --> 01:37:16,219
if he survived
the freezing process, that is.

985
01:37:16,261 --> 01:37:18,871
Well, Calrissian, did he survive?

986
01:37:18,890 --> 01:37:20,586
Yes, he's alive.

987
01:37:21,391 --> 01:37:23,350
And in perfect hibernation.

988
01:37:24,229 --> 01:37:26,447
He's all yours, bounty hunter.

989
01:37:27,231 --> 01:37:29,015
Reset the chamber for Skywalker.

990
01:37:31,360 --> 01:37:33,275
Skywalker has just landed, lord.

991
01:37:33,322 --> 01:37:37,365
Good. See to it
that he finds his way in here.

992
01:37:41,454 --> 01:37:43,412
Calrissian...

993
01:37:43,457 --> 01:37:45,979
take the princess
and the Wookiee to my ship.

994
01:37:46,001 --> 01:37:48,219
You said they'd be left
under my supervision.

995
01:37:48,253 --> 01:37:50,384
I am altering the deal.

996
01:37:50,421 --> 01:37:53,247
Pray I don't alter it any further.

997
01:39:30,399 --> 01:39:33,051
Luke, don't! It's a trap!

998
01:39:34,444 --> 01:39:35,576
It's a trap!

999
01:40:21,953 --> 01:40:24,430
The Force is with you,
young Skywalker.

1000
01:40:26,748 --> 01:40:28,880
But you are not a Jedi yet.

1001
01:41:30,814 --> 01:41:32,511
Well done.

1002
01:41:34,233 --> 01:41:37,148
Hold them in the security tower.
And keep it quiet.

1003
01:41:37,154 --> 01:41:38,893
Move.

1004
01:41:43,284 --> 01:41:46,704
- What do you think you're doing?
- We're getting out of here.

1005
01:41:46,706 --> 01:41:48,532
I knew all along.
It had to be a mistake.

1006
01:41:48,582 --> 01:41:51,539
Do you think that
after what you did to Han...

1007
01:41:52,420 --> 01:41:55,838
- I had no choice.
- What are you doing? Trust him!

1008
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:58,966
We understand, don't we, Chewie?
He had no choice.

1009
01:41:58,967 --> 01:42:00,578
I'm just trying to help.

1010
01:42:00,636 --> 01:42:03,375
We don't need any of your help.

1011
01:42:08,394 --> 01:42:09,960
What?

1012
01:42:10,021 --> 01:42:14,805
- It sounds like Han.
- There's still a chance to save Han...

1013
01:42:15,568 --> 01:42:18,961
at the east... platform.

1014
01:42:23,033 --> 01:42:25,252
I'm terribly sorry about all this.

1015
01:42:25,286 --> 01:42:27,113
After all, he's only a Wookiee.

1016
01:42:27,997 --> 01:42:30,780
Put Captain Solo
in the cargo hold.

1017
01:42:45,890 --> 01:42:48,238
R2, where have you been?

1018
01:42:48,269 --> 01:42:50,225
Wait. Turn around, you woolly...

1019
01:42:51,354 --> 01:42:54,225
Hurry! We're trying to save
Han from the bounty hunter.

1020
01:42:56,862 --> 01:42:59,382
Well, at least
you're still in one piece.

1021
01:42:59,404 --> 01:43:01,840
Look what's happened to me.

1022
01:43:13,711 --> 01:43:16,407
Oh, no!
Chewie, they're behind you!

1023
01:43:29,269 --> 01:43:31,703
You have learned much, young one.

1024
01:43:31,729 --> 01:43:33,947
You'll find I'm full of surprises.

1025
01:43:45,452 --> 01:43:48,670
Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker.

1026
01:43:49,413 --> 01:43:51,980
Obi-Wan knew this to be true.

1027
01:43:59,966 --> 01:44:01,358
All too easy.

1028
01:44:06,556 --> 01:44:09,122
Perhaps you're not as strong
as the emperor thought.

1029
01:44:12,188 --> 01:44:13,885
Impressive.

1030
01:44:15,774 --> 01:44:17,253
Most impressive.

1031
01:44:25,076 --> 01:44:28,902
Obi-Wan has taught you well.
You have controlled your fear.

1032
01:44:31,542 --> 01:44:34,876
Now, release your anger.

1033
01:44:34,877 --> 01:44:37,573
Only your hatred can destroy me.

1034
01:46:48,430 --> 01:46:50,431
The security code
has been changed.

1035
01:46:50,475 --> 01:46:53,909
R2, you can tell the computer
to override the security systems.

1036
01:46:54,729 --> 01:46:56,511
R2, hurry.

1037
01:46:59,733 --> 01:47:02,125
Attention.
This is Lando Calrissian. Attention.

1038
01:47:02,153 --> 01:47:04,197
The Empire has taken control
of the city.

1039
01:47:04,238 --> 01:47:07,195
I advise everyone to leave
before more imperial troops arrive.

1040
01:47:13,582 --> 01:47:15,277
This way.

1041
01:47:15,332 --> 01:47:17,637
Well, don't blame me.
I'm an interpreter.

1042
01:47:17,670 --> 01:47:20,671
I'm not supposed to know a power socket
from a computer terminal.

1043
01:47:42,152 --> 01:47:45,195
We're not interested in the hyperdrive
on the Falcon. It's fixed!

1044
01:47:50,077 --> 01:47:52,990
Just open the door,
you stupid lump!

1045
01:48:01,463 --> 01:48:03,985
I never doubted you for a second.
Wonderful!

1046
01:48:28,408 --> 01:48:31,234
That hurts! Bend down,
you thoughtless... Ow!

1047
01:48:38,252 --> 01:48:39,686
Go!

1048
01:48:46,051 --> 01:48:48,965
I thought that hairy beast
would be the end of me.

1049
01:48:48,970 --> 01:48:50,927
Of course I've looked better.

1050
01:49:44,528 --> 01:49:48,322
You are beaten.
It is useless to resist.

1051
01:49:48,323 --> 01:49:51,975
Don't let yourself be destroyed
as Obi-Wan did.

1052
01:50:07,635 --> 01:50:09,329
There is no escape.

1053
01:50:10,136 --> 01:50:12,354
Don't make me destroy you.

1054
01:50:16,268 --> 01:50:19,137
You do not yet realize
your importance.

1055
01:50:19,146 --> 01:50:21,930
You have only begun
to discover your power.

1056
01:50:21,940 --> 01:50:23,854
Join me...

1057
01:50:23,902 --> 01:50:26,380
and I will complete your training.

1058
01:50:26,404 --> 01:50:28,882
With our combined strength...

1059
01:50:28,905 --> 01:50:31,951
we can end
this destructive conflict...

1060
01:50:31,952 --> 01:50:34,344
and bring order to the galaxy.

1061
01:50:34,371 --> 01:50:36,979
I'll never join you!

1062
01:50:36,997 --> 01:50:41,208
If you only knew the power
of the dark side.

1063
01:50:41,210 --> 01:50:45,547
Obi-Wan never told you
what happened to your father.

1064
01:50:45,548 --> 01:50:47,028
He told me enough.

1065
01:50:49,594 --> 01:50:51,506
He told me you killed him.

1066
01:50:53,224 --> 01:50:55,396
I am your father.

1067
01:51:03,859 --> 01:51:05,859
That's not true.

1068
01:51:06,653 --> 01:51:08,350
That's impossible!

1069
01:51:08,405 --> 01:51:11,796
Search your feelings.
You know it to be true.

1070
01:51:20,501 --> 01:51:24,752
You can destroy the emperor.
He has foreseen this.

1071
01:51:24,755 --> 01:51:27,756
It is your destiny.

1072
01:51:27,757 --> 01:51:29,542
Join me...

1073
01:51:29,594 --> 01:51:34,073
and together we can rule the galaxy
as father and son.

1074
01:51:44,524 --> 01:51:46,221
Come with me.

1075
01:51:47,029 --> 01:51:49,289
It is the only way.

1076
01:52:55,472 --> 01:52:56,908
Ben.

1077
01:52:57,725 --> 01:52:59,640
Ben, please.

1078
01:53:27,506 --> 01:53:29,158
Hear me.

1079
01:53:36,055 --> 01:53:38,186
- We've got to go back.
- What?

1080
01:53:38,225 --> 01:53:40,661
- I know where Luke is.
- What about those fighters?

1081
01:53:41,686 --> 01:53:44,034
Chewie, just do it.

1082
01:53:44,064 --> 01:53:45,846
All right, all right!

1083
01:53:53,992 --> 01:53:58,210
Alert my Stardestroyer
to prepare for my arrival.

1084
01:54:08,590 --> 01:54:10,721
Look, someone's up there.

1085
01:54:11,884 --> 01:54:14,451
It's Luke.
Chewie, slow down.

1086
01:54:14,470 --> 01:54:17,905
We'll get under him.
Lando, open the top hatch.

1087
01:54:33,698 --> 01:54:36,135
Okay. Easy, Chewie.

1088
01:54:57,805 --> 01:55:00,024
- Lando?
- Okay, let's go.

1089
01:55:19,997 --> 01:55:21,475
All right, Chewie. Let's go.

1090
01:55:56,993 --> 01:55:58,905
I'll be back.

1091
01:56:04,582 --> 01:56:06,018
Stardestroyer.

1092
01:56:11,216 --> 01:56:13,780
All right, Chewie.
Ready for light speed.

1093
01:56:13,801 --> 01:56:15,931
If your people fixed the hyperdrive.

1094
01:56:15,970 --> 01:56:18,404
All the coordinates are set.
It's now or never.

1095
01:56:18,430 --> 01:56:19,953
Punch it!

1096
01:56:30,568 --> 01:56:32,958
They told me they fixed it.

1097
01:56:32,985 --> 01:56:34,944
I trusted them!

1098
01:56:34,988 --> 01:56:37,597
It's not my fault!

1099
01:56:43,122 --> 01:56:45,863
They'll be in range
of our tractor beam in moments, lord.

1100
01:56:45,876 --> 01:56:49,545
Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive
on the Millennium Falcon?

1101
01:56:49,546 --> 01:56:51,634
- Yes, my lord.
- Good.

1102
01:56:51,672 --> 01:56:55,425
Prepare the boarding party
and set your weapons for stun.

1103
01:56:55,426 --> 01:56:58,557
- Yes, my lord. Lieutenant.
- Yes, sir.

1104
01:57:00,014 --> 01:57:03,434
Noisy brute. Why don't we
just go into light speed?

1105
01:57:03,435 --> 01:57:05,087
We can't?

1106
01:57:05,145 --> 01:57:07,623
How would you know
the hyperdrive is deactivated?

1107
01:57:10,818 --> 01:57:13,819
The city's central computer told you?

1108
01:57:13,820 --> 01:57:16,690
R2-D2, you know better
than to trust a strange computer.

1109
01:57:16,698 --> 01:57:20,134
Ouch! Pay attention
to what you're doing.

1110
01:57:32,297 --> 01:57:33,515
Father.

1111
01:57:35,342 --> 01:57:37,561
Son, come with me.

1112
01:57:40,515 --> 01:57:41,993
Ben.

1113
01:57:43,018 --> 01:57:45,192
Why didn't you tell me?

1114
01:58:03,329 --> 01:58:04,591
It's Vader.

1115
01:58:10,377 --> 01:58:14,118
Luke, it is your destiny.

1116
01:58:21,681 --> 01:58:24,030
Why didn't you tell me?

1117
01:58:30,231 --> 01:58:34,319
Alert all commands.
Ready for the tractor beam.

1118
01:58:37,614 --> 01:58:40,484
R2, come back at once!
You haven't finished with me yet.

1119
01:58:40,493 --> 01:58:44,119
You don't know how to fix the
hyperdrive. Chewbacca can do it.

1120
01:58:44,121 --> 01:58:48,731
I'm standing here in pieces
and you're having delusions of grandeur!

1121
01:58:51,712 --> 01:58:53,234
You did it!

1122
01:59:50,898 --> 01:59:54,029
- Luke, we're ready for take-off.
- Good luck, Lando.

1123
01:59:54,943 --> 01:59:59,030
When we find Jabba the Hutt and
that bounty hunter, we'll contact you.

1124
01:59:59,032 --> 02:00:01,770
I'll meet you at
the rendezvous point on Tatooine.

1125
02:00:01,784 --> 02:00:05,328
Princess, we'll find Han.
I promise.

1126
02:00:05,329 --> 02:00:07,634
Chewie, I'll be waiting
for your signal.

1127
02:00:07,664 --> 02:00:09,448
Take care, you two.

1128
02:00:09,501 --> 02:00:11,631
May the Force be with you.
