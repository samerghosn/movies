1
00:02:47,466 --> 00:02:49,401
Did you hear that?

2
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,163
They shut down the main reactor.

3
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:52,897
We'll be destroyed for sure.

4
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:53,973
This is madness.

5
00:03:04,016 --> 00:03:05,245
We're doomed.

6
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:12,552
There'll be no escape
for the princess this time.

7
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:14,783
What's that?

8
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,663
R2-D2, where are you?

9
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:16,841
At last!

10
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:18,713
Where have you been?

11
00:05:18,817 --> 00:05:20,012
They're heading in this direction.

12
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,951
What are we going to do?

13
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:23,817
We'll be sent to
the spice mines of Kessel...

14
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:25,389
smashed into who knows what!

15
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,457
Wait a minute.
Where are you going?

16
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:44,298
<i>The Death Star plans
are not in the main computer.</i>

17
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:47,038
Where are those transmissions
you intercepted?

18
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:49,980
What have you done with those plans?

19
00:05:50,082 --> 00:05:52,915
We intercepted no transmissions.

20
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,816
This is a consular ship.

21
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,014
We're on a diplomatic mission.

22
00:05:57,122 --> 00:05:59,353
If this is a consular ship...

23
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:01,653
where is the ambassador?

24
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:08,565
Commander, tear this ship apart
until you've found those plans...

25
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:11,660
and bring me the passengers!
I want them alive!

26
00:06:24,216 --> 00:06:25,774
There's one. Set for stun.

27
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,122
She'll be all right.

28
00:06:33,225 --> 00:06:35,125
Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.

29
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:38,391
Hey! You're not permitted in there.
It's restricted.

30
00:06:38,497 --> 00:06:41,262
You'll be deactivated for sure.

31
00:06:43,235 --> 00:06:44,600
Don't you call me
a mindless philosopher...

32
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:45,863
you overweight glob of grease!

33
00:06:45,971 --> 00:06:47,598
Now come out before
somebody sees you.

34
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:51,874
Secret mission?
What plans?

35
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:53,274
What are you talking about?

36
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:54,846
I'm not getting in there.

37
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,483
I'm going to regret this.

38
00:07:06,925 --> 00:07:08,324
There goes another one.

39
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:10,588
Hold your fire.
There's no life forms.

40
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:12,391
It must have short-circuited.

41
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:16,832
That's funny. The damage
doesn't look as bad from out here.

42
00:07:16,935 --> 00:07:18,836
Are you sure this thing is safe?

43
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:22,031
Oh.

44
00:07:37,956 --> 00:07:41,586
Darth Vader.
Only you could be so bold.

45
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:44,026
The Imperial Senate will
not sit still for this.

46
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:45,290
When they hear you've
attacked a diplomatic...

47
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:46,865
Don't act so surprised,
Your Highness.

48
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,456
You weren't on any
mercy mission this time.

49
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:53,665
Several transmissions were
beamed to this ship by rebel spies.

50
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:56,639
I want to know what happened
to the plans they sent you.

51
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:58,437
I don't know what
you're talking about.

52
00:07:58,545 --> 00:08:00,307
I'm a member of the Imperial Senate...

53
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:01,846
on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan.

54
00:08:01,947 --> 00:08:04,814
You are part of the Rebel Alliance
and a traitor.

55
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:06,509
Take her away!

56
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:12,218
Holding her is dangerous.

57
00:08:12,324 --> 00:08:13,882
If word of this gets out...

58
00:08:13,992 --> 00:08:15,824
it could generate sympathy
for the rebellion in the senate.

59
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:18,523
I've traced the rebel spies to her.

60
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:21,326
Now she is my only link
to finding their secret base.

61
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:23,834
She'll die before
she'll tell you anything.

62
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:25,233
Leave that to me.

63
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,964
Send a distress signal...

64
00:08:27,072 --> 00:08:29,336
and then inform the senate
that all aboard were killed.

65
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:30,841
Lord Vader,
the battle station plans...

66
00:08:30,944 --> 00:08:32,138
are not aboard this ship...

67
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:33,677
and no transmissions were made.

68
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:36,304
An escape pod was jettisoned
during the fighting...

69
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:37,974
but no life forms were aboard.

70
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:40,847
She must have hidden
the plans in the escape pod.

71
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:44,720
Send a detachment down to retrieve
them... See to it personally, Commander.

72
00:08:44,823 --> 00:08:47,349
There'll be no one
to stop us this time.

73
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,552
Yes, sir.

74
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:04,841
How did we get into this mess?

75
00:09:04,943 --> 00:09:07,605
I really don't know how.

76
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,306
We seem to be made to suffer.

77
00:09:09,414 --> 00:09:10,779
It's our lot in life.

78
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:16,216
I've got to rest before I fall apart.

79
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:18,289
My joints are almost frozen.

80
00:09:24,062 --> 00:09:26,860
What a desolate place this is!

81
00:09:31,169 --> 00:09:32,865
Where do you think you're going?

82
00:09:32,971 --> 00:09:34,633
Well, I'm not going that way.

83
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,368
It's much too rocky.

84
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:38,307
This way is much easier.

85
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,379
What makes you think...

86
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,379
there are settlements over there?

87
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,407
Don't get technical with me.

88
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:48,783
What mission?
What are you talking about?

89
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,250
I've just about had enough of you.

90
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:54,758
Go that way.

91
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,760
You'll be malfunctioning within a day...

92
00:09:56,863 --> 00:09:58,455
you nearsighted scrap pile.

93
00:09:58,563 --> 00:10:00,929
And don't let me catch you
following me begging for help...

94
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:02,500
because you won't get it.

95
00:10:16,581 --> 00:10:18,277
No more adventures.

96
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:20,351
I'm not going that way.

97
00:10:54,052 --> 00:10:55,451
That malfunctioning little twerp.

98
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:57,648
This is all his fault.

99
00:10:57,756 --> 00:11:00,452
He tricked me into going this way...

100
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,424
but he'll do no better.

101
00:11:06,164 --> 00:11:07,826
Wait! What's that?

102
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:09,332
A transport.

103
00:11:09,434 --> 00:11:11,129
I'm saved!

104
00:11:11,236 --> 00:11:12,966
Over here!

105
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:14,129
Hey!

106
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,900
Hey!

107
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:19,536
Help! Please help!

108
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:50,687
R2?

109
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:57,721
R2-D2, it is you! It is you!

110
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:33,227
Someone was in the pod.

111
00:15:33,331 --> 00:15:35,994
The tracks go off in this direction.

112
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,036
Look, sir, droids.

113
00:15:52,684 --> 00:15:54,277
We stopped.

114
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:56,081
Wake up! Wake up!

115
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:03,994
We're doomed.

116
00:16:11,803 --> 00:16:13,931
Do you think they'll melt us down?

117
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:29,687
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!

118
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:31,416
Will this never end?

119
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:13,763
All right, fine. Let's go.

120
00:17:13,865 --> 00:17:15,992
Luke! Luke!

121
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:22,568
Luke, tell Uncle
if he gets a translator...

122
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:24,438
be sure it speaks Bocce.

123
00:17:24,542 --> 00:17:27,067
Doesn't look like we have much
of a choice, but I'll remind him.

124
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:39,584
Yeah, we'll take that red one.

125
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:41,750
No, not that one.

126
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,198
I suppose you're programmed
for etiquette and protocol.

127
00:17:47,298 --> 00:17:48,698
Protocol? Why, it's
my primary function, sir.

128
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,269
I am well-versed in all the customs...

129
00:17:51,369 --> 00:17:53,030
I have no need for a protocol droid.

130
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:54,697
Of course you haven't, sir.

131
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:56,035
Not in an environment such as this.

132
00:17:56,142 --> 00:17:57,439
That is why I have
been programmed...

133
00:17:57,542 --> 00:17:59,703
What I really need is
a droid who understands...

134
00:17:59,811 --> 00:18:01,711
the binary language
of moisture vaporators.

135
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:05,113
Vaporators? Sir, my first job
was programming binary load lifters...

136
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:06,479
very similar to your vaporators
in most respects.

137
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,246
Can you speak Bocce?

138
00:18:08,354 --> 00:18:10,913
Of course I can, sir.
It's like a second language to me...

139
00:18:11,022 --> 00:18:12,319
Yeah, all right. Shut up.
I'll take this one.

140
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,721
Luke!

141
00:18:16,327 --> 00:18:18,421
Take these two over
to the garage, will you?

142
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:19,724
I want them cleaned up before dinner.

143
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:20,890
But I was going into Tosche Station...

144
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,398
to pick up some power converters.

145
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,968
You can waste time
with your friends...

146
00:18:24,068 --> 00:18:25,558
when your chores are done.

147
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:27,638
Now come on. Get to it.

148
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,901
All right. Come on.

149
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,635
And the red one. Come on.

150
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:38,348
Well, come on, red. Let's go.

151
00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:57,826
Uncle Owen!

152
00:18:57,936 --> 00:18:59,336
Yeah?

153
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:02,167
This R2 unit has
a bad motivator. Look.

154
00:19:02,273 --> 00:19:04,673
Hey, what are you
trying to push on us?

155
00:19:07,046 --> 00:19:08,637
Excuse me, sir...

156
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:12,204
but that R2 unit is in prime condition,
a real bargain.

157
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,650
Uncle Owen, what about that one?

158
00:19:14,752 --> 00:19:16,117
What about that blue one?

159
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:18,554
We'll take that one.

160
00:19:18,656 --> 00:19:19,884
Take this away.

161
00:19:19,991 --> 00:19:21,356
You'll be very pleased
with that one, sir.

162
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,290
He really is in first-class condition.

163
00:19:23,394 --> 00:19:24,487
I've worked with him before.

164
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:25,564
Here he comes.

165
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:30,799
O.K. Let's go.

166
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:32,733
Now, don't you forget this.

167
00:19:32,837 --> 00:19:34,634
Why I should stick
my neck out for you...

168
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,673
is quite beyond my capacity.

169
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:44,244
Thank the maker!

170
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,375
This oil bath is going to feel so good.

171
00:19:46,484 --> 00:19:50,147
I've got such a bad case
of dust contamination...

172
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:51,314
I can barely move.

173
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,480
It just isn't fair.

174
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,148
Oh, Biggs is right.

175
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:56,557
I'm never gonna get out of here.

176
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:58,653
Is there anything I might do to help?

177
00:19:58,763 --> 00:20:01,198
No. Not unless you can alter time...

178
00:20:01,299 --> 00:20:03,700
speed up the harvest,
or teleport me off this rock.

179
00:20:03,801 --> 00:20:05,394
I don't think so, sir.

180
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,868
I'm only a droid...

181
00:20:06,971 --> 00:20:08,404
and not very knowledgeable
about such things...

182
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:10,236
not on this planet, anyway.

183
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:13,742
As a matter of fact,
I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.

184
00:20:13,846 --> 00:20:16,246
Well, if there's
a bright center to the universe...

185
00:20:16,347 --> 00:20:18,781
you're on the planet
that it's farthest from.

186
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,044
I see, sir.

187
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:21,881
You can call me Luke.

188
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:23,385
I see, Sir Luke.

189
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:24,717
Ha ha.

190
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:26,085
Just Luke.

191
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:29,887
Oh... And I am C-3PO,
human-cyborg relations.

192
00:20:29,994 --> 00:20:32,394
This is my counterpart... R2-D2.

193
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:33,726
Hello.

194
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,230
You got a lot of carbon scoring.

195
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:39,394
Looks like you boys have
seen a lot of action.

196
00:20:39,505 --> 00:20:41,132
With all we've been through...

197
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,037
sometimes I'm amazed we're in
as good condition as we are...

198
00:20:43,142 --> 00:20:44,540
what with the rebellion and all.

199
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:46,542
You know of the rebellion
against the Empire?!

200
00:20:46,644 --> 00:20:48,703
That's how we came
to be in your service...

201
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:50,212
if you take my meaning, sir.

202
00:20:50,316 --> 00:20:51,442
Have you been in many battles?

203
00:20:51,549 --> 00:20:52,881
Several, I think.

204
00:20:52,984 --> 00:20:54,474
Actually, there's not much to tell.

205
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,451
I'm not much more
than an interpreter...

206
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:58,420
and not very good at telling stories.

207
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:00,890
Well, not at making them
interesting, anyway.

208
00:21:00,992 --> 00:21:02,961
Well, my little friend...

209
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:05,894
you got something jammed
in here real good.

210
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:07,396
Were you on a Starcruiser or...

211
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:10,900
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.

212
00:21:11,002 --> 00:21:13,061
What's this?

213
00:21:13,172 --> 00:21:15,163
"What is what"?
He asked you a question.

214
00:21:15,273 --> 00:21:16,262
What is that?

215
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:17,773
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

216
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:20,002
You're my only hope.

217
00:21:23,781 --> 00:21:25,442
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

218
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,279
You're my only hope.

219
00:21:28,921 --> 00:21:31,684
He says it's nothing, sir,
merely a malfunction.

220
00:21:31,789 --> 00:21:34,258
Old data. Pay it no mind.

221
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:36,759
Who is she?
She's beautiful.

222
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:40,194
I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.

223
00:21:40,298 --> 00:21:42,699
I think she was a passenger
on our last voyage.

224
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,529
A person of some importance, I believe.

225
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:45,762
Our captain was attached...

226
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:47,030
Is there any more
to this recording?

227
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:50,472
Behave yourself, R2.

228
00:21:50,576 --> 00:21:52,373
You're going to get us into trouble.

229
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:55,276
It's all right. You can trust him.
He's our new master.

230
00:21:58,049 --> 00:22:01,451
He says that he's the property
of Obi-Wan Kenobi...

231
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:03,019
a resident of these parts...

232
00:22:03,122 --> 00:22:04,952
and it's a private message for him.

233
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:07,025
Quite frankly, sir, I don't know what
he's talking about.

234
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:09,116
Our last master
was Captain Antilles.

235
00:22:09,228 --> 00:22:10,694
But with all
we've been through...

236
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:13,855
this little R2 unit has
become a bit eccentric.

237
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:17,128
Obi-Wan Kenobi.
I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi.

238
00:22:17,236 --> 00:22:19,864
I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know
what he's talking about?

239
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:21,872
I don't know any Obi-Wan...

240
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:25,375
but old Ben lives out
beyond the Dune Sea.

241
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:27,240
He's kind of a strange old hermit.

242
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,813
Help me,
Obi-Wan Kenobi.

243
00:22:28,913 --> 00:22:30,381
I wonder who she is.

244
00:22:30,481 --> 00:22:31,539
Sounds like she's in trouble.

245
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,549
I better play back the whole thing.

246
00:22:35,421 --> 00:22:37,651
He says the restraining bolt...

247
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:40,417
has short-circuited
his recording system.

248
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:43,358
He suggests that if you remove the bolt...

249
00:22:43,461 --> 00:22:45,759
he might be able to play
back the entire recording.

250
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,263
Oh, yeah. Well...

251
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:50,835
I guess you're too small
to run away on me...

252
00:22:50,935 --> 00:22:52,163
if I take this off.

253
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,259
O. K...

254
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,775
There you go.

255
00:22:57,875 --> 00:22:59,901
Wait a minute.
Where'd she go?

256
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:02,502
Bring her back.
Play back the entire message.

257
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:03,705
"What message"?

258
00:23:03,816 --> 00:23:06,010
The one you've just been playing!

259
00:23:06,117 --> 00:23:08,108
The one you're carrying
inside your rusty innards.

260
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,346
Luke! Luke!

261
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:11,888
All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.

262
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,457
I'm sorry, sir...

263
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:16,392
but he appears to have
picked up a slight flutter.

264
00:23:16,494 --> 00:23:18,122
Here. See what you can do with him.

265
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,891
I'll be right back.

266
00:23:21,532 --> 00:23:25,434
Just you reconsider playing
that message for him.

267
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:28,938
No, I don't think he likes you at all.

268
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,406
No, I don't like you, either.

269
00:23:37,982 --> 00:23:41,281
You know, I think that R2 unit
we bought might have been stolen.

270
00:23:41,385 --> 00:23:43,980
What makes you think that?

271
00:23:44,088 --> 00:23:46,557
Well, I stumbled across a recording
while I was cleaning him.

272
00:23:46,657 --> 00:23:49,626
He says he belongs to someone
called Obi-Wan Kenobi.

273
00:23:51,529 --> 00:23:53,930
I thought he might have meant old Ben.

274
00:23:54,031 --> 00:23:55,499
Do you know what
he's talking about?

275
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:56,567
Mm-mm.

276
00:23:56,667 --> 00:23:59,796
I wonder if he's related to Ben.

277
00:23:59,904 --> 00:24:01,667
That wizard's just a crazy old man.

278
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:05,174
Tomorrow, I want you to take
that R2 unit to Anchorhead...

279
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:06,767
and have its memory erased.

280
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:08,846
That'll be the end of it.
It belongs to us now.

281
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:13,243
But what if this Obi-Wan
comes looking for him?

282
00:24:13,352 --> 00:24:14,410
He won't.

283
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:16,920
I don't think he exists anymore.

284
00:24:17,021 --> 00:24:19,422
He died about the same time
as your father.

285
00:24:19,525 --> 00:24:20,787
He knew my father?

286
00:24:20,893 --> 00:24:22,622
I told you to forget it.

287
00:24:22,728 --> 00:24:27,131
Your only concern is to prepare
those new droids for tomorrow.

288
00:24:27,231 --> 00:24:29,165
In the morning, I want them
up there on the south ridge...

289
00:24:29,268 --> 00:24:31,098
working on those condensers.

290
00:24:31,202 --> 00:24:32,260
Yes, sir.

291
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:36,271
I think those new droids
are gonna work out fine.

292
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:40,141
In fact, I, uh, was also thinking
about our agreement...

293
00:24:40,244 --> 00:24:43,476
about me staying on another season?

294
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:45,777
And if these new droids
do work out...

295
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:47,817
I want to transmit my application
to the academy this year.

296
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,683
You mean the next semester
before the harvest?

297
00:24:50,788 --> 00:24:52,619
Sure. There's more
than enough droids.

298
00:24:52,723 --> 00:24:54,714
Harvest is when I need you the most.

299
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,852
It's only one season more.

300
00:24:56,961 --> 00:24:58,554
This year we'll make
enough on the harvest...

301
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:00,256
that I'll be able
to hire more hands...

302
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:03,334
and then you can go
to the academy next year.

303
00:25:03,434 --> 00:25:05,163
You must understand
I need you here, Luke.

304
00:25:05,269 --> 00:25:07,067
But it's a whole 'nother year!

305
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,469
Look, it's only one more season.

306
00:25:08,574 --> 00:25:10,701
Yeah, that's what you said
when Biggs and Tank left.

307
00:25:10,808 --> 00:25:11,833
Where are you going?

308
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:13,172
Looks like I'm going nowhere.

309
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:15,075
I have to go finish
cleaning those droids.

310
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,147
Owen, he can't stay here forever.

311
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:18,546
Most of his friends have gone.

312
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,742
It means so much to him.

313
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:22,650
I'll make it up to him next year.

314
00:25:22,753 --> 00:25:23,742
I promise.

315
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:27,257
Luke's just not a farmer, Owen.

316
00:25:27,358 --> 00:25:29,384
He has too much of his father in him.

317
00:25:29,493 --> 00:25:31,553
That's what I'm afraid of.

318
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,740
Ooh!

319
00:26:20,846 --> 00:26:22,278
What are you doing
hiding back there?

320
00:26:22,381 --> 00:26:25,713
It wasn't my fault, sir.
Please don't deactivate me.

321
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:28,650
I told him not to go,
but he's faulty, malfunctioning.

322
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:30,311
Kept babbling on about his mission.

323
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,048
Oh, no.

324
00:26:39,865 --> 00:26:42,834
That R2 unit has always
been a problem.

325
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:45,460
These astrodroids
are getting quite out of hand.

326
00:26:45,569 --> 00:26:47,560
Even I can't understand
their logic at times.

327
00:26:47,673 --> 00:26:49,140
How could I be so stupid?

328
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,434
He's nowhere in sight.

329
00:26:50,541 --> 00:26:51,736
Blast it!

330
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:54,436
Pardon me, sir,
but couldn't we go after him?

331
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:56,240
It's too dangerous
with all the Sand People around.

332
00:26:56,347 --> 00:26:58,406
We'll have to wait until morning.

333
00:26:58,517 --> 00:26:59,744
Luke! I'm shutting the power down.

334
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:02,250
All right!
I'll be there in a few minutes.

335
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:03,820
Boy, am I gonna get it.

336
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:06,788
That little droid's going to
cause me a lotta trouble.

337
00:27:06,892 --> 00:27:09,223
Oh, he excels at that, sir.

338
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:11,761
Come on.

339
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:20,431
Luke?

340
00:27:21,707 --> 00:27:22,866
Luke!

341
00:27:24,375 --> 00:27:25,707
Luke!

342
00:27:31,415 --> 00:27:33,713
Have you seen Luke this morning?

343
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:35,844
He said he had some things to do
before he started today...

344
00:27:35,953 --> 00:27:37,285
so he left early.

345
00:27:37,388 --> 00:27:38,822
Did he take those
two new droids with him?

346
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:40,391
I think so.

347
00:27:40,491 --> 00:27:43,119
Well, he better have those units
in the south range...

348
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:45,695
repaired by midday,
or there'll be hell to pay.

349
00:27:45,864 --> 00:27:47,694
Lookit, there's a droid on the scanner.

350
00:27:47,798 --> 00:27:49,323
Dead ahead.

351
00:27:49,433 --> 00:27:52,425
It might be our little R2 unit.
Hit the accelerator!

352
00:28:13,657 --> 00:28:16,490
Hey, whoa! Where do
you think you're going?

353
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:19,660
Master Luke is your rightful owner now.

354
00:28:19,765 --> 00:28:22,757
We'll have no more
of this Obi-Wan Kenobi gibberish.

355
00:28:24,336 --> 00:28:25,597
And don't talk to me
of your mission, either.

356
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:27,000
You're fortunate he doesn't blast you...

357
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:28,538
into a million pieces right here!

358
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,732
No. It's all right,
but I think we'd better go.

359
00:28:32,443 --> 00:28:34,377
What's wrong with him now?

360
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:36,742
There are several creatures
approaching from the southeast.

361
00:28:36,847 --> 00:28:40,715
Sand People, or worse.

362
00:28:40,818 --> 00:28:42,719
Come on.
Let's go have a look.

363
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:43,913
Come on!

364
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:49,289
Well, there are
two Banthas down there...

365
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,384
but I don't see any...
Wait a second.

366
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:52,894
They're Sand People, all right.

367
00:28:52,998 --> 00:28:55,761
I can see one of them now.

368
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:11,201
Hello, there.

369
00:30:13,612 --> 00:30:16,876
Come here, my little friend.
Don't be afraid.

370
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:21,349
Oh, don't worry.
He'll be all right.

371
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:30,057
Rest easy, son.
You've had a busy day.

372
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:33,927
You're fortunate
to be all in one piece.

373
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:37,698
Ben?

374
00:30:37,801 --> 00:30:39,326
Ben Kenobi?

375
00:30:39,436 --> 00:30:41,404
Boy, am I glad to see you.

376
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:44,531
The Jundland Wastes are not
to be traveled lightly.

377
00:30:46,677 --> 00:30:48,805
Tell me, young Luke...

378
00:30:48,913 --> 00:30:51,815
what brings you out this far?

379
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:53,577
This little droid.

380
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:57,211
I think he's searching
for his former master...

381
00:30:57,322 --> 00:31:00,722
but I've never seen such devotion
in a droid before.

382
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:02,759
He claims to be the property...

383
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,488
of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.

384
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:05,756
Is he a relative of yours?

385
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:08,263
Do you know who
he's talking about?

386
00:31:08,365 --> 00:31:10,492
Obi-Wan Kenobi?

387
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:14,263
Obi-Wan.

388
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:19,332
Now, that's a name
I've not heard in a long time.

389
00:31:19,443 --> 00:31:21,877
A long time.

390
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,278
I think my uncle knows him.

391
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:25,905
He said he was dead.

392
00:31:26,017 --> 00:31:27,847
Oh, he's not dead.

393
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:29,078
Not yet.

394
00:31:29,186 --> 00:31:30,619
You know him?

395
00:31:30,721 --> 00:31:33,623
Well, of course I know him.
He's me.

396
00:31:35,693 --> 00:31:39,596
I haven't gone by the name of Obi-Wan...

397
00:31:39,698 --> 00:31:42,132
since, oh, before you were born.

398
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,065
Well, then the droid
does belong to you.

399
00:31:44,169 --> 00:31:46,865
I don't seem to remember
ever owning a droid.

400
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:49,901
Very interesting.

401
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:54,276
I think we better get indoors.

402
00:31:54,378 --> 00:31:56,869
The Sand People are easily startled...

403
00:31:56,981 --> 00:32:00,383
but they'll soon be back,
and in greater numbers.

404
00:32:03,188 --> 00:32:04,621
3PO.

405
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,662
Where am I?
I must have taken a bad step.

406
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:19,760
Can you stand?

407
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:21,429
We've got to get out of here before
the Sand People return.

408
00:32:21,538 --> 00:32:24,064
I don't think I can make it.
You go on, Master Luke.

409
00:32:24,174 --> 00:32:26,836
There's no sense in you risking yourself
on my account.

410
00:32:26,944 --> 00:32:28,344
I'm done for.

411
00:32:28,445 --> 00:32:30,242
No, you're not.

412
00:32:30,347 --> 00:32:31,405
What kind of talk is that?

413
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:33,143
Quickly. They're on the move.

414
00:32:37,955 --> 00:32:40,015
No, my father didn't
fight in the wars.

415
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:41,922
He was a navigator
on a spice freighter.

416
00:32:42,027 --> 00:32:43,857
That's what your uncle told you.

417
00:32:43,961 --> 00:32:45,792
He didn't hold
with your father's ideals.

418
00:32:45,896 --> 00:32:47,090
Thought he should
have stayed here...

419
00:32:47,198 --> 00:32:49,028
and not gotten involved.

420
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:51,102
You fought in the Clone Wars?

421
00:32:51,201 --> 00:32:54,103
Yes. I was once a Jedi knight...

422
00:32:54,204 --> 00:32:55,501
the same as your father.

423
00:32:58,076 --> 00:32:59,838
I wish I'd known him.

424
00:32:59,943 --> 00:33:03,778
He was the best starpilot in the galaxy...

425
00:33:03,882 --> 00:33:05,372
and a cunning warrior.

426
00:33:05,482 --> 00:33:06,471
I understand you've become...

427
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:09,314
quite a good pilot yourself.

428
00:33:09,421 --> 00:33:12,321
And he was a good friend.

429
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:14,550
Which reminds me...

430
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:17,388
I have something here for you.

431
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:22,396
Your father wanted you to have this...

432
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,898
when you were old enough...

433
00:33:24,001 --> 00:33:26,060
but your uncle
wouldn't allow it.

434
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:27,729
He feared you might
follow old Obi-Wan...

435
00:33:27,838 --> 00:33:29,829
on some damn-fool
idealistic crusade...

436
00:33:29,941 --> 00:33:31,703
like your father did.

437
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:33,641
Sir, if you'll not be needing me...

438
00:33:33,744 --> 00:33:34,711
I'll close down for a while.

439
00:33:34,813 --> 00:33:36,513
Sure. Go ahead.

440
00:33:37,848 --> 00:33:39,713
What is it?

441
00:33:39,817 --> 00:33:42,582
It's your father's lightsaber.

442
00:33:42,686 --> 00:33:45,986
This is the weapon of a Jedi knight.

443
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:49,891
Not as clumsy or random
as a blaster.

444
00:33:49,993 --> 00:33:55,932
An elegant weapon
for a more civilized age.

445
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,263
For over a thousand generations...

446
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:00,269
the Jedi knights were the guardians...

447
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:03,432
of peace and justice
in the old Republic...

448
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:06,374
before the dark times...

449
00:34:06,478 --> 00:34:08,070
before the Empire.

450
00:34:10,614 --> 00:34:13,014
How did my father die?

451
00:34:14,351 --> 00:34:17,411
A young Jedi named Darth Vader...

452
00:34:17,521 --> 00:34:20,684
who was a pupil of mine
until he turned to evil...

453
00:34:20,791 --> 00:34:24,784
helped the Empire hunt down
and destroy the Jedi knights.

454
00:34:26,364 --> 00:34:29,025
He betrayed and
murdered your father.

455
00:34:29,134 --> 00:34:33,070
Now the Jedi are all but extinct.

456
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:38,074
Vader was seduced
by the dark side of the Force.

457
00:34:38,175 --> 00:34:39,699
The Force?

458
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:43,211
The Force is what gives
a Jedi his power.

459
00:34:43,313 --> 00:34:47,375
It's an energy field created
by all living things.

460
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:49,315
It surrounds us, penetrates us...

461
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,480
it binds the galaxy together.

462
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:02,059
Now let's see if we can't figure out
what you are, my little friend...

463
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:04,101
and where you come from.

464
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:05,793
I saw part of a message he was...

465
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:07,929
I seem to have found it.

466
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:12,135
General Kenobi, years ago
you served my father in the Clone Wars.

467
00:35:12,242 --> 00:35:13,608
Now he begs you to help him...

468
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,940
in his struggle against the Empire.

469
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:18,811
I regret that I am unable to present
my father's request to you in person.

470
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:20,907
But my ship has fallen under attack...

471
00:35:21,018 --> 00:35:23,248
and I am afraid my mission
to bring you to Alderaan has failed.

472
00:35:23,353 --> 00:35:25,083
I have placed information...

473
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,817
vital to the survival
of the rebellion...

474
00:35:26,925 --> 00:35:28,789
into the memory systems
of this R2 unit.

475
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:30,690
My father will know
how to retrieve it.

476
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,456
You must see this droid...

477
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:35,123
safely delivered to him on Alderaan.

478
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:36,961
This is our most desperate hour.

479
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:41,128
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.

480
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:57,813
You must learn
the ways of the Force...

481
00:35:57,922 --> 00:36:00,152
if you're to come
with me to Alderaan.

482
00:36:00,257 --> 00:36:02,692
Alderaan?
I'm not going to Alderaan.

483
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:04,284
I've got to get home.

484
00:36:04,394 --> 00:36:05,726
It's late.
I'm in for it as it is.

485
00:36:05,829 --> 00:36:08,628
<i>I need your help, Luke.
She needs your help.</i>

486
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:11,860
I'm getting too old
for this sort of thing.

487
00:36:15,907 --> 00:36:17,306
I can't get involved.

488
00:36:17,407 --> 00:36:19,807
I've got work to do.

489
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:22,471
It's not that I like the Empire.
I hate it...

490
00:36:22,579 --> 00:36:25,811
but there's nothing
I can do about it right now.

491
00:36:25,916 --> 00:36:28,043
It's all such a long way from here.

492
00:36:28,152 --> 00:36:30,143
That's your uncle talking.

493
00:36:30,255 --> 00:36:31,483
My uncle.

494
00:36:31,588 --> 00:36:34,079
How am I ever gonna explain this?

495
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,920
Learn about the Force, Luke.

496
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:45,197
Look, I can take you
as far as Anchorhead.

497
00:36:45,302 --> 00:36:49,329
You can get a transport there to
Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.

498
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,398
You must do what you feel
is right, of course.

499
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:03,210
Until this battle station
is fully operational...

500
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,753
we are vulnerable.

501
00:37:04,856 --> 00:37:06,914
The Rebel Alliance
is too well equipped.

502
00:37:07,025 --> 00:37:09,016
They're more dangerous
than you realize.

503
00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:11,527
Dangerous to
your starfleet, Commander...

504
00:37:11,628 --> 00:37:13,789
not to this battle station.

505
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:16,628
The rebellion will
continue to gain support...

506
00:37:16,733 --> 00:37:18,429
in the Imperial Senate...

507
00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:21,699
The Imperial Senate will no longer
be of any concern to us.

508
00:37:21,806 --> 00:37:23,364
I have just received word...

509
00:37:23,474 --> 00:37:26,034
that the emperor has
dissolved the council permanently.

510
00:37:26,143 --> 00:37:28,704
The last remnants
of the old Republic...

511
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:30,246
have been swept away.

512
00:37:30,347 --> 00:37:32,043
That's impossible.

513
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:34,414
How will the emperor maintain control
without the bureaucracy?

514
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:37,420
The regional governors
now have direct control...

515
00:37:37,521 --> 00:37:39,251
over their territories.

516
00:37:39,356 --> 00:37:43,418
Fear will keep
the local systems in line...

517
00:37:43,527 --> 00:37:44,927
fear of this battle station.

518
00:37:45,028 --> 00:37:46,893
And what of the rebellion?

519
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:48,898
If the rebels have obtained...

520
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,262
a complete technical readout
of this station...

521
00:37:50,367 --> 00:37:52,063
it is possible, however unlikely...

522
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:54,467
that they might find a weakness
and exploit it.

523
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:58,804
The plans you refer to will
soon be back in our hands.

524
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:01,344
Any attack made by the rebels
against this station...

525
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:02,811
would be a useless gesture...

526
00:38:02,914 --> 00:38:05,280
no matter what technical data
they've obtained.

527
00:38:05,382 --> 00:38:08,978
This station is now the ultimate power
in the universe.

528
00:38:09,086 --> 00:38:11,418
I suggest we use it.

529
00:38:11,521 --> 00:38:12,954
Don't be too proud...

530
00:38:13,056 --> 00:38:15,286
of this technological terror
you've constructed.

531
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:18,793
The ability to destroy
a planet is insignificant...

532
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:21,159
next to the power of the Force.

533
00:38:21,264 --> 00:38:24,701
Don't try to frighten us with
your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader.

534
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:27,771
Your sad devotion
to that ancient religion...

535
00:38:27,871 --> 00:38:30,340
hasn't helped you conjure up
the stolen data tapes...

536
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,431
or given you
clairvoyance enough...

537
00:38:32,543 --> 00:38:34,737
to find the rebels'
hidden fortre...

538
00:38:40,717 --> 00:38:43,550
I find your lack
of faith disturbing.

539
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:48,117
Enough of this.
Vader, release him.

540
00:38:48,226 --> 00:38:49,784
As you wish.

541
00:38:51,963 --> 00:38:54,021
This bickering is pointless.

542
00:38:54,132 --> 00:38:58,898
Lord Vader will provide us with
the location of the rebel fortress...

543
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:01,835
by the time this station
is operational.

544
00:39:01,938 --> 00:39:04,304
We will then crush the rebellion...

545
00:39:04,409 --> 00:39:05,842
with one swift stroke.

546
00:39:12,617 --> 00:39:14,641
It looks like the Sand People
did this, all right.

547
00:39:14,751 --> 00:39:16,481
Look. There's gaffi sticks,
Bantha tracks.

548
00:39:16,586 --> 00:39:17,644
It's just, I've never heard of them...

549
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:18,722
hitting anything this big before.

550
00:39:18,822 --> 00:39:19,880
They didn't...

551
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:22,481
but we are meant to think they did.

552
00:39:22,592 --> 00:39:24,492
These tracks are side-by-side.

553
00:39:24,594 --> 00:39:26,755
Sand People always ride single file...

554
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:28,764
to hide their numbers.

555
00:39:28,865 --> 00:39:31,197
These are the same Jawas
that sold us R2 and 3PO.

556
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:34,760
And these blast points,
too accurate...

557
00:39:34,871 --> 00:39:36,237
for Sand People.

558
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:39,775
Only imperial stormtroopers
are so precise.

559
00:39:39,876 --> 00:39:43,074
But why would imperial troops
want to slaughter Jawas?

560
00:39:47,617 --> 00:39:49,778
If they traced the robots here...

561
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:51,114
they may have learned
who they sold them to...

562
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,246
and that would lead
them back... home!

563
00:39:53,356 --> 00:39:54,914
Wait, Luke!

564
00:39:55,025 --> 00:39:56,994
It's too dangerous!

565
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:22,307
Uncle Owen!

566
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,887
Aunt Beru!

567
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:26,320
Uncle Owen!

568
00:41:15,438 --> 00:41:16,838
And now, Your Highness...

569
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:18,840
we will discuss the location...

570
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:21,206
of your hidden rebel base.

571
00:42:03,987 --> 00:42:05,887
There's nothing you could
have done, Luke...

572
00:42:05,989 --> 00:42:07,547
had you been there.

573
00:42:07,657 --> 00:42:09,387
You'd have been killed, too...

574
00:42:09,492 --> 00:42:13,088
and the droids would now be
in the hands of the Empire.

575
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:16,893
I want to come
with you to Alderaan.

576
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:18,764
There's nothing for me here now.

577
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:21,099
I want to learn
the ways of the Force...

578
00:42:21,204 --> 00:42:22,728
and become a Jedi
like my father.

579
00:42:37,954 --> 00:42:40,788
Mos Eisley spaceport.

580
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:46,125
You will never find a more
wretched hive of scum and villainy.

581
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,197
We must be cautious.

582
00:43:29,673 --> 00:43:31,903
How long have you
had these droids?

583
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:33,237
Three or four seasons.

584
00:43:33,344 --> 00:43:34,641
They're up for sale
if you want them.

585
00:43:34,744 --> 00:43:36,610
Let me see your identification.

586
00:43:36,713 --> 00:43:40,012
You don't need to see
his identification.

587
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:42,483
We don't need to see
his identification.

588
00:43:42,585 --> 00:43:44,952
These aren't the droids
you're looking for.

589
00:43:45,056 --> 00:43:47,956
These aren't the droids
we're looking for.

590
00:43:48,059 --> 00:43:50,458
He can go about his business.

591
00:43:50,561 --> 00:43:52,960
You can go about your business.

592
00:43:53,063 --> 00:43:54,030
Move along.

593
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:55,358
Move along.

594
00:43:55,465 --> 00:43:56,659
Move along.

595
00:44:12,048 --> 00:44:15,951
I can't abide those Jawas.
Disgusting creatures!

596
00:44:16,052 --> 00:44:18,521
Go on, go on.

597
00:44:20,056 --> 00:44:22,286
I can't understand how
we got by those troops.

598
00:44:22,393 --> 00:44:23,791
I thought we were dead.

599
00:44:23,893 --> 00:44:26,623
The Force can have
a strong influence...

600
00:44:26,731 --> 00:44:28,197
on the weak-minded.

601
00:44:31,235 --> 00:44:32,827
Do you really think we're
gonna find a pilot here...

602
00:44:32,936 --> 00:44:34,494
that'll take us to Alderaan?

603
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:37,539
Most of the best freighter pilots
are to be found here...

604
00:44:37,641 --> 00:44:39,039
only watch your step.

605
00:44:39,143 --> 00:44:40,871
This place can be a little rough.

606
00:44:40,978 --> 00:44:43,070
I'm ready for anything.

607
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:48,108
Come along, R2.

608
00:45:38,568 --> 00:45:41,628
Hey! We don't serve their kind here.

609
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:42,706
What?

610
00:45:42,806 --> 00:45:44,398
Your droids,
they'll have to wait outside.

611
00:45:44,507 --> 00:45:45,634
We don't want them here.

612
00:45:45,742 --> 00:45:46,902
Why don't you wait
out by the speeder?

613
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:48,068
We don't want any trouble.

614
00:45:48,179 --> 00:45:50,043
I heartily agree with you, sir.

615
00:45:58,521 --> 00:45:59,715
Uh...

616
00:45:59,824 --> 00:46:01,121
I'll have one of those.

617
00:46:36,626 --> 00:46:38,356
He doesn't like you.

618
00:46:38,461 --> 00:46:40,259
I'm sorry.

619
00:46:40,364 --> 00:46:42,958
I don't like you, either.

620
00:46:43,067 --> 00:46:44,864
You just watch yourself.

621
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:46,128
We're wanted men.

622
00:46:46,237 --> 00:46:49,536
I have the death sentence on 12 systems.

623
00:46:49,639 --> 00:46:51,130
I'll be careful.

624
00:46:51,242 --> 00:46:52,469
You'll be dead!

625
00:46:52,576 --> 00:46:54,476
This little one's not worth the effort.

626
00:46:54,577 --> 00:46:56,842
Come, let me get you something.

627
00:47:03,454 --> 00:47:05,684
Aah!

628
00:47:23,907 --> 00:47:25,398
I'm all right.

629
00:47:26,577 --> 00:47:28,976
Chewbacca here is first mate...

630
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:32,070
on a ship that might suit us.

631
00:47:35,085 --> 00:47:38,543
I don't like the look of this.

632
00:47:53,003 --> 00:47:57,063
<i>Han Solo. I'm captain
of the Millennium Falcon.</i>

633
00:47:57,173 --> 00:48:00,541
Chewie here tells me you're looking
for passage to the Alderaan system.

634
00:48:00,643 --> 00:48:02,942
Yes, indeed,
if it's a fast ship.

635
00:48:03,047 --> 00:48:05,947
<i>Fast ship? You've never heard
of the Millennium Falcon?</i>

636
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:08,541
Should I have?

637
00:48:08,652 --> 00:48:11,849
It's the ship that made the Kessel run
in less than 12 parsecs.

638
00:48:13,791 --> 00:48:16,021
I've outrun imperial starships.

639
00:48:16,126 --> 00:48:18,184
Not the local bulk cruisers,
mind you.

640
00:48:18,295 --> 00:48:20,422
I'm talking about
the big Corellian ships now.

641
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:24,565
She's fast enough for you,
old man.

642
00:48:24,668 --> 00:48:26,295
What's the cargo?

643
00:48:26,402 --> 00:48:29,530
Only passengers...
myself, the boy...

644
00:48:29,639 --> 00:48:31,130
two droids...

645
00:48:31,242 --> 00:48:34,210
and no questions asked.

646
00:48:34,311 --> 00:48:37,302
What is it, some kind
of local trouble?

647
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:40,541
Let's just say we'd like to avoid...

648
00:48:40,650 --> 00:48:42,585
any imperial entanglements.

649
00:48:42,686 --> 00:48:46,452
Well, that's the real trick, isn't it?

650
00:48:46,556 --> 00:48:48,855
And it's gonna cost you
something extra.

651
00:48:50,661 --> 00:48:52,458
10,000, all in advance.

652
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:55,429
10,000?

653
00:48:55,532 --> 00:48:59,297
We could almost
buy our own ship for that!

654
00:48:59,402 --> 00:49:01,632
But who's gonna fly it,
kid, you?

655
00:49:01,739 --> 00:49:03,797
You bet I could.
I'm not such a bad pilot myself.

656
00:49:03,907 --> 00:49:06,306
We don't have
to sit here and listen...

657
00:49:06,409 --> 00:49:09,503
We can pay you 2,000 now...

658
00:49:09,612 --> 00:49:12,639
plus 15 when
we reach Alderaan.

659
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:14,650
Seventeen, huh?

660
00:49:16,586 --> 00:49:20,579
O.K. You guys got
yourselves a ship.

661
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:21,952
We'll leave as soon
as you're ready.

662
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:23,150
Docking Bay 94.

663
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:24,420
Ninety-four.

664
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:28,427
Looks like somebody's
beginning to take an interest...

665
00:49:28,532 --> 00:49:30,931
in your handiwork.

666
00:49:31,034 --> 00:49:33,161
All right.
We'll check it out.

667
00:49:45,048 --> 00:49:46,447
17,000!

668
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:48,108
Those guys must really
be desperate.

669
00:49:48,217 --> 00:49:50,277
This could really save my neck.

670
00:49:50,387 --> 00:49:53,014
Get back to the ship,
get it ready.

671
00:49:53,123 --> 00:49:54,715
You'll have to sell your speeder.

672
00:49:54,824 --> 00:49:58,192
That's O.K. I'm never coming back
to this planet again.

673
00:49:58,362 --> 00:50:00,853
Going somewhere, Solo?

674
00:50:00,963 --> 00:50:02,726
Yes, Greedo.

675
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:03,958
As a matter of fact,
I was just going to see your boss.

676
00:50:04,068 --> 00:50:06,126
Tell Jabba that I've got his money.

677
00:50:06,235 --> 00:50:08,295
It's too late.

678
00:50:08,405 --> 00:50:10,804
You should have paid him
when you had the chance.

679
00:50:10,907 --> 00:50:14,309
Jabba's put a price on your head
so large...

680
00:50:14,411 --> 00:50:17,380
every bounty hunter in the galaxy
will be looking for you.

681
00:50:17,481 --> 00:50:19,472
I'm lucky I found you first.

682
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:21,744
Yeah, but this time I've got the money.

683
00:50:21,851 --> 00:50:25,413
If you give it to me,
I might forget I found you.

684
00:50:25,521 --> 00:50:28,081
I don't have it with me.

685
00:50:28,192 --> 00:50:29,181
Tell Jabba...

686
00:50:29,293 --> 00:50:31,420
Jabba's through with you.

687
00:50:31,527 --> 00:50:34,052
He has no time for smugglers...

688
00:50:34,164 --> 00:50:36,724
who drop their shipments at
the first sign of an imperial cruiser.

689
00:50:36,833 --> 00:50:38,494
Even I get boarded sometimes.

690
00:50:38,601 --> 00:50:40,661
Do you think I had a choice?

691
00:50:40,771 --> 00:50:44,867
You can tell that to Jabba.
He may only take your ship.

692
00:50:44,974 --> 00:50:47,034
Over my dead body.

693
00:50:47,143 --> 00:50:48,405
That's the idea.

694
00:50:48,512 --> 00:50:52,505
I've been looking forward to this
for a long time.

695
00:50:52,615 --> 00:50:53,913
I'll bet you have.

696
00:51:07,697 --> 00:51:09,597
Sorry about the mess.

697
00:51:18,809 --> 00:51:22,369
Her resistance to the mind probe
is considerable.

698
00:51:22,478 --> 00:51:25,539
It'll be some time before we can
extract any information from her.

699
00:51:25,648 --> 00:51:27,548
The final checkout is completed.

700
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:29,208
All systems are operational.

701
00:51:29,318 --> 00:51:31,219
What course shall we set?

702
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:32,947
Perhaps she would respond...

703
00:51:33,056 --> 00:51:34,956
to an alternative
form of persuasion.

704
00:51:35,057 --> 00:51:36,456
What do you mean?

705
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:38,460
I think it is time
we demonstrated...

706
00:51:38,561 --> 00:51:40,291
the full power of this station.

707
00:51:40,396 --> 00:51:41,920
Set your course for Alderaan.

708
00:51:42,032 --> 00:51:43,431
With pleasure.

709
00:51:43,534 --> 00:51:45,831
Lock the door, R2.

710
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:50,369
Check this side of the street.

711
00:51:53,744 --> 00:51:56,907
The door's locked.
Move on to the next.

712
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:04,918
I would much rather have
gone with Master Luke...

713
00:52:05,021 --> 00:52:06,489
than stay here with you.

714
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:08,922
I don't know what
all this trouble is about...

715
00:52:09,025 --> 00:52:10,686
but I'm sure
it must be your fault.

716
00:52:11,862 --> 00:52:13,056
You watch your language.

717
00:52:15,097 --> 00:52:18,260
All right. Give it to me.
I'll take it.

718
00:52:18,367 --> 00:52:19,925
Look at this.

719
00:52:20,036 --> 00:52:22,027
Ever since the XP-38 came out,
they just aren't in demand.

720
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:23,606
It'll be enough.

721
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:45,585
Solo! Come out of there, Solo!

722
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:48,688
Right here, Jabba.

723
00:52:50,132 --> 00:52:51,657
I've been waitin' for you.

724
00:52:51,768 --> 00:52:53,702
Have you now.

725
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:56,931
You didn't think I was gonna run, did you?

726
00:52:58,407 --> 00:53:02,844
Han, my boy, you disappoint me.

727
00:53:02,945 --> 00:53:05,005
Why haven't you paid me...

728
00:53:05,114 --> 00:53:08,516
and why did you fry poor Greedo?

729
00:53:08,619 --> 00:53:11,315
Look, Jabba, next time you want to
talk to me, come see me yourself.

730
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:12,717
Don't send one of these twerps.

731
00:53:12,822 --> 00:53:16,519
Han, I can't make exceptions.

732
00:53:16,626 --> 00:53:19,494
What if everyone who smuggled for me...

733
00:53:19,596 --> 00:53:22,155
dropped their cargo at the first sign...

734
00:53:22,266 --> 00:53:24,893
of an imperial starship?

735
00:53:25,001 --> 00:53:26,902
It's not good business.

736
00:53:27,003 --> 00:53:30,235
Look, Jabba,
even I get boarded sometimes.

737
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,840
You think I had a choice?

738
00:53:33,943 --> 00:53:35,706
But I got a nice, easy charter.

739
00:53:35,811 --> 00:53:38,110
I'll pay ya back, plus a little extra.

740
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:40,182
I just need a little more time.

741
00:53:40,284 --> 00:53:45,847
Han, my boy, you're the best.

742
00:53:45,956 --> 00:53:48,356
So, for an extra 20%...

743
00:53:48,458 --> 00:53:50,391
Fifteen, Jabba. Don't push it.

744
00:53:50,494 --> 00:53:52,552
Okay, 15%.

745
00:53:52,663 --> 00:53:54,789
But if you fail me again...

746
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:57,867
I'll put a price on your head so big...

747
00:53:57,967 --> 00:54:01,960
you won't be able to go near
a civilized system.

748
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:04,699
Jabba... you're a wonderful human being.

749
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:07,635
Come on!

750
00:54:13,483 --> 00:54:15,576
If the ship's as fast as he's boasting...

751
00:54:15,686 --> 00:54:17,016
we ought to do well.

752
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:42,911
What a piece of junk!

753
00:54:43,012 --> 00:54:45,242
She'll make.5 past light speed.

754
00:54:45,349 --> 00:54:46,815
She may not look like much...

755
00:54:46,916 --> 00:54:48,543
but she's got it
where it counts, kid.

756
00:54:48,652 --> 00:54:51,347
I've made a lot of
special modifications myself.

757
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:53,945
But we're a little rushed,
so if you'll just get on board...

758
00:54:54,056 --> 00:54:55,489
we'll get outta here.

759
00:55:00,097 --> 00:55:01,324
Hello, sir.

760
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:11,873
Which way?

761
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:15,842
All right, men,
load your weapons.

762
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:20,009
Stop that ship!
Blast them!

763
00:55:29,291 --> 00:55:31,021
Chewie, get us out of here!

764
00:55:32,561 --> 00:55:36,726
Oh, my. I'd forgotten how much
I hate space travel.

765
00:55:55,585 --> 00:55:56,916
Looks like an imperial cruiser.

766
00:55:57,019 --> 00:55:58,009
Our passengers must be hotter
than I thought.

767
00:55:58,121 --> 00:55:59,713
Try and hold 'em off.

768
00:55:59,822 --> 00:56:01,380
Angle the deflector shields
while I make the calculations...

769
00:56:01,490 --> 00:56:02,458
for the jump to light speed.

770
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:14,431
Stay sharp.
There's two more comin' in.

771
00:56:14,538 --> 00:56:16,335
They're gonna try
and cut us off.

772
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:18,237
Why don't you outrun 'em?
I thought you said this thing was fast!

773
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:20,240
Watch your mouth, kid, or you're
gonna find yourself floating home.

774
00:56:20,342 --> 00:56:21,708
We'll be safe enough...

775
00:56:21,811 --> 00:56:23,746
once we make the jump
to hyperspace.

776
00:56:23,847 --> 00:56:25,746
Besides, I know a few maneuvers.
We'll lose 'em.

777
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:31,844
Here's where the fun begins.

778
00:56:31,954 --> 00:56:33,717
How long before you can make
the jump to light speed?

779
00:56:33,824 --> 00:56:36,554
It'll take a few moments to get
the coordinates from the navicomputer.

780
00:56:36,659 --> 00:56:38,389
Are you kidding?
At the rate they're gaining?

781
00:56:38,494 --> 00:56:41,692
Traveling through hyperspace
ain't like dustin' crops, boy!

782
00:56:41,797 --> 00:56:42,856
Without precise calculations...

783
00:56:42,965 --> 00:56:44,057
we'd fly right through a star...

784
00:56:44,166 --> 00:56:45,634
or bounce too close
to a supernova...

785
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:47,704
and that would end your trip
real quick, wouldn't it?

786
00:56:47,804 --> 00:56:48,771
What's that flashing?

787
00:56:48,871 --> 00:56:49,963
We're losing a deflector shield.

788
00:56:50,072 --> 00:56:51,300
Go strap yourselves in.

789
00:56:51,407 --> 00:56:53,273
I'm gonna make the jump to light speed.

790
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:16,664
We've entered the Alderaan system.

791
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:17,994
Governor Tarkin.

792
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:19,568
I should have expected...

793
00:57:19,668 --> 00:57:21,568
to find you holding Vader's leash.

794
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:23,228
I recognized your foul stench...

795
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:25,307
when I was brought on board.

796
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:28,672
Charming to the last.

797
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:31,440
You don't know
how hard I found it...

798
00:57:31,547 --> 00:57:33,516
signing the order
to terminate your life.

799
00:57:33,617 --> 00:57:34,811
I'm surprised you had the courage...

800
00:57:34,918 --> 00:57:36,407
to take the responsibility yourself.

801
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:39,579
Princess Leia,
before your execution...

802
00:57:39,688 --> 00:57:41,349
I would like you to be my guest...

803
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:44,949
at a ceremony that will make
this battle station operational.

804
00:57:45,061 --> 00:57:48,155
No star system will dare
oppose the emperor now.

805
00:57:48,264 --> 00:57:50,699
The more you tighten
your grip, Tarkin...

806
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,530
the more star systems
will slip through your fingers.

807
00:57:53,637 --> 00:57:56,628
Not after we demonstrate
the power of this station.

808
00:57:56,739 --> 00:57:59,139
In a way,
you have determined...

809
00:57:59,242 --> 00:58:02,108
the choice of the planet
that will be destroyed first.

810
00:58:02,211 --> 00:58:04,043
Since you are reluctant...

811
00:58:04,146 --> 00:58:07,115
to provide us with the location
of the rebel base...

812
00:58:07,217 --> 00:58:10,117
I have chosen to test this station's
destructive power...

813
00:58:10,219 --> 00:58:13,211
on your home planet of Alderaan.

814
00:58:13,322 --> 00:58:14,516
No! Alderaan is peaceful.

815
00:58:14,623 --> 00:58:16,114
We have no weapons.
You can't possibly...

816
00:58:16,226 --> 00:58:18,217
You would prefer another target?
A military target?

817
00:58:18,327 --> 00:58:20,853
Then name the system.

818
00:58:22,731 --> 00:58:26,065
I grow tired of asking this,
so it will be the last time.

819
00:58:26,168 --> 00:58:28,864
Where is the rebel base?

820
00:58:32,409 --> 00:58:34,570
Dantooine.

821
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:36,144
They're on Dantooine.

822
00:58:36,246 --> 00:58:38,646
There. You see, Lord Vader?

823
00:58:38,748 --> 00:58:40,181
She can be reasonable.

824
00:58:40,282 --> 00:58:42,079
Continue with the operation.
You may fire when ready.

825
00:58:42,184 --> 00:58:43,675
What?

826
00:58:43,786 --> 00:58:45,152
You're far too trusting.

827
00:58:45,255 --> 00:58:46,722
Dantooine is too remote...

828
00:58:46,822 --> 00:58:49,347
to make an effective demonstration,
but don't worry.

829
00:58:49,458 --> 00:58:52,360
We will deal with your rebel friends
soon enough.

830
00:58:52,461 --> 00:58:53,554
No!

831
00:58:54,797 --> 00:58:56,925
Commence primary ignition.

832
00:59:20,023 --> 00:59:23,389
Are you all right?
What's wrong?

833
00:59:23,492 --> 00:59:25,893
I felt a great disturbance
in the Force...

834
00:59:25,996 --> 00:59:27,519
as if millions of voices...

835
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:29,530
suddenly cried out in terror...

836
00:59:29,632 --> 00:59:31,190
and were suddenly silenced.

837
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:34,030
I fear something terrible
has happened.

838
00:59:35,472 --> 00:59:38,134
You'd better get on
with your exercises.

839
00:59:40,210 --> 00:59:42,940
Well, you can forget your troubles
with those imperial slugs.

840
00:59:43,045 --> 00:59:45,014
I told you I'd outrun them.

841
00:59:49,052 --> 00:59:51,110
Don't everybody thank me at once.

842
00:59:51,221 --> 00:59:55,681
Anyway, we should be at Alderaan
about 0200 hours.

843
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:04,996
Now be careful, R2.

844
01:00:13,043 --> 01:00:14,601
Argh!

845
01:00:14,710 --> 01:00:16,474
He made a fair move.
Screaming about it can't help you.

846
01:00:16,579 --> 01:00:19,411
Let him have it. It's not wise
to upset a Wookiee.

847
01:00:19,516 --> 01:00:21,847
But, sir, nobody worries
about upsetting a droid.

848
01:00:21,952 --> 01:00:25,012
That's 'cause a droid don't pull
people's arms out of their sockets...

849
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:26,519
when they lose.

850
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:28,681
Wookiees are known to do that.

851
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:30,452
Grrr...

852
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:33,027
I see your point, sir.

853
01:00:33,128 --> 01:00:34,527
I suggest a new strategy, R2.

854
01:00:34,630 --> 01:00:36,121
Let the Wookiee win.

855
01:00:36,231 --> 01:00:38,722
Argh!

856
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:58,213
Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force
flowing through him.

857
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:00,346
You mean it controls your actions?

858
01:01:00,456 --> 01:01:03,391
Partially, but it also
obeys your commands.

859
01:01:07,896 --> 01:01:10,956
Hokey religions and
ancient weapons are no match...

860
01:01:11,067 --> 01:01:12,728
for a good blaster
at your side, kid.

861
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:15,168
You don't believe
in the Force, do you?

862
01:01:15,271 --> 01:01:18,536
Kid, I've flown from
one side of this galaxy to the other.

863
01:01:18,641 --> 01:01:20,199
I've seen a lot of strange stuff...

864
01:01:20,309 --> 01:01:22,641
but I've never seen anything
to make me believe...

865
01:01:22,746 --> 01:01:26,204
there's one all-powerful force
controlling everything.

866
01:01:26,315 --> 01:01:30,411
There's no mystical
energy field controls my destiny.

867
01:01:30,519 --> 01:01:34,512
It's all a lot of
simple tricks and nonsense.

868
01:01:34,623 --> 01:01:37,525
I suggest you try it again, Luke.

869
01:01:37,626 --> 01:01:40,561
This time, let go
your conscious self...

870
01:01:42,498 --> 01:01:44,659
and act on instinct.

871
01:01:44,768 --> 01:01:48,067
With the blast shield down,
I can't even see.

872
01:01:48,170 --> 01:01:49,570
How am I supposed to fight?

873
01:01:49,672 --> 01:01:50,661
Your eyes can deceive you.

874
01:01:50,773 --> 01:01:51,831
Don't trust them.

875
01:02:01,284 --> 01:02:03,581
Stretch out with your feelings.

876
01:02:18,034 --> 01:02:20,195
You see? You can do it.

877
01:02:20,302 --> 01:02:21,929
I call it luck.

878
01:02:22,038 --> 01:02:24,632
In my experience,
there's no such thing as luck.

879
01:02:24,740 --> 01:02:27,141
Look, good against remotes
is one thing.

880
01:02:27,242 --> 01:02:30,143
Good against the living,
that's something else.

881
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:33,208
Looks like we're coming
up on Alderaan.

882
01:02:36,552 --> 01:02:37,884
You know, I did feel something.

883
01:02:37,987 --> 01:02:39,146
I could almost see the remote.

884
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:40,222
That's good.

885
01:02:40,322 --> 01:02:42,153
You've taken your first step...

886
01:02:42,257 --> 01:02:44,054
into a larger world.

887
01:02:48,530 --> 01:02:49,657
Yes?

888
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:52,599
Our scout ships have
reached Dantooine.

889
01:02:52,702 --> 01:02:54,601
They found the remains
of a rebel base...

890
01:02:54,704 --> 01:02:57,070
but they estimate that it has
been deserted for some time.

891
01:02:57,172 --> 01:03:00,733
They are now conducting an extensive
search of the surrounding systems.

892
01:03:00,844 --> 01:03:03,813
She lied. She lied to us!

893
01:03:03,913 --> 01:03:06,643
I told you she would never...

894
01:03:06,748 --> 01:03:09,148
consciously betray the rebellion.

895
01:03:09,251 --> 01:03:11,152
Terminate her immediately.

896
01:03:14,382 --> 01:03:15,507
Stand by, Chewie.
Here we go.

897
01:03:15,617 --> 01:03:17,016
Cut in the sublight engines.

898
01:03:19,286 --> 01:03:20,914
What the...

899
01:03:22,023 --> 01:03:22,969
Arrghh arrgh!

900
01:03:23,005 --> 01:03:23,916
Arrghh arrgh!

901
01:03:24,025 --> 01:03:26,425
We've come out of hyperspace
into a meteor shower.

902
01:03:26,527 --> 01:03:27,755
Some kind of asteroid collision.

903
01:03:27,862 --> 01:03:28,920
It's not on any of the charts.

904
01:03:29,030 --> 01:03:30,155
What's going on?

905
01:03:30,264 --> 01:03:32,528
Our position's correct,
except no Alderaan.

906
01:03:32,634 --> 01:03:33,931
What do you mean?
Where is it?

907
01:03:34,034 --> 01:03:35,297
That's what I'm trying
to tell you, kid.

908
01:03:35,402 --> 01:03:36,802
It ain't there. It's
been totally blown away.

909
01:03:36,903 --> 01:03:37,961
What? How?

910
01:03:38,072 --> 01:03:39,596
Destroyed by the Empire.

911
01:03:39,706 --> 01:03:42,005
The entire starfleet couldn't destroy
the whole planet.

912
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:43,474
It would take 1,000 ships
with more firepower than...

913
01:03:45,445 --> 01:03:47,277
There's another ship coming in.

914
01:03:47,382 --> 01:03:48,349
Maybe they know what happened.

915
01:03:48,449 --> 01:03:49,677
It's an imperial fighter.

916
01:03:51,318 --> 01:03:52,445
It followed us!

917
01:03:52,552 --> 01:03:54,543
No. It's a short-range fighter.

918
01:03:54,655 --> 01:03:56,681
There aren't any bases around here.
Where did it come from?

919
01:03:59,927 --> 01:04:01,690
It sure is leaving in a big hurry.

920
01:04:01,795 --> 01:04:02,784
If they identify us,
we're in big trouble.

921
01:04:02,896 --> 01:04:03,864
Not if I can help it.

922
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:04,931
Chewie, jam its transmissions.

923
01:04:05,032 --> 01:04:06,000
It would be as well to let it go.

924
01:04:06,099 --> 01:04:07,088
It's too far out of range.

925
01:04:07,201 --> 01:04:08,360
Not for long.

926
01:04:11,271 --> 01:04:15,402
A fighter that size couldn't get
this deep into space on its own.

927
01:04:15,510 --> 01:04:18,172
He must have gotten lost,
been part of a convoy or something.

928
01:04:18,278 --> 01:04:19,905
Well, he ain't gonna
be around long enough...

929
01:04:20,014 --> 01:04:21,139
to tell anybody about us.

930
01:04:23,650 --> 01:04:25,481
Look at him.
He's heading for that small moon.

931
01:04:25,585 --> 01:04:28,213
I think I can get him before
he gets there. He's almost in range.

932
01:04:29,791 --> 01:04:31,815
That's no moon.

933
01:04:31,925 --> 01:04:33,393
It's a space station.

934
01:04:33,494 --> 01:04:35,291
It's too big to be a space station.

935
01:04:38,632 --> 01:04:41,067
I have a very bad feeling about this.

936
01:04:41,168 --> 01:04:42,931
Turn the ship around.

937
01:04:43,036 --> 01:04:45,231
Yeah. I think you're right.
Full reverse!

938
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:47,570
Chewie, lock in
the auxiliary power.

939
01:04:51,778 --> 01:04:54,246
Chewie, lock in
the auxiliary power!

940
01:04:56,617 --> 01:04:58,346
Why are we still
moving towards it?!

941
01:04:58,452 --> 01:05:00,250
We're caught in a tractor beam.
It's pulling us in!

942
01:05:00,355 --> 01:05:02,016
There's got to be
something you can do!

943
01:05:02,123 --> 01:05:03,521
There's nothing
I can do about it, kid.

944
01:05:03,623 --> 01:05:04,851
I'm at full power.
I'm gonna have to shut down.

945
01:05:04,958 --> 01:05:06,449
They're not gonna
get me without a fight.

946
01:05:10,998 --> 01:05:12,295
You can't win...

947
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:14,527
but there are alternatives
to fighting.

948
01:05:31,184 --> 01:05:33,311
Clear Bay 327.

949
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:35,786
We are opening
the magnetic field.

950
01:05:50,405 --> 01:05:51,632
To your stations!

951
01:05:51,739 --> 01:05:53,036
Come with me.

952
01:05:56,943 --> 01:05:58,501
<i>Close all outboard shields.</i>

953
01:05:58,612 --> 01:06:00,581
<i>Close all outboard shields.</i>

954
01:06:02,048 --> 01:06:03,106
Yes?

955
01:06:03,217 --> 01:06:04,650
<i>We've captured a freighter...</i>

956
01:06:04,751 --> 01:06:06,083
<i>entering the remains
of the Alderaan system.</i>

957
01:06:06,186 --> 01:06:07,916
<i>Its markings match
those of a ship...</i>

958
01:06:08,021 --> 01:06:10,456
<i>that blasted its way
out of Mos Eisley.</i>

959
01:06:10,557 --> 01:06:14,085
They must be trying to return
the stolen plans to the princess.

960
01:06:14,195 --> 01:06:17,130
She may yet be of some use to us.

961
01:06:21,869 --> 01:06:25,827
<i>Unlock 1, 5, 7, and 9.
Release charge.</i>

962
01:06:27,675 --> 01:06:29,768
<i>316, report to control.</i>

963
01:06:32,746 --> 01:06:34,715
There's no one on board, sir.

964
01:06:34,815 --> 01:06:37,545
According to the log, the crew
abandoned ship right after takeoff.

965
01:06:37,652 --> 01:06:39,552
It must be a decoy, sir.

966
01:06:39,653 --> 01:06:41,018
Several of the escape pods
have been jettisoned.

967
01:06:41,121 --> 01:06:42,146
Did you find any droids?

968
01:06:42,255 --> 01:06:43,222
No, sir.

969
01:06:43,324 --> 01:06:45,188
If there were any on board,
they must also have jettisoned.

970
01:06:45,293 --> 01:06:46,817
Send a scanning crew aboard.

971
01:06:46,927 --> 01:06:48,724
I want every part
of this ship checked.

972
01:06:48,829 --> 01:06:49,818
Yes, sir.

973
01:06:49,931 --> 01:06:51,329
I sense something...

974
01:06:51,431 --> 01:06:54,400
a presence I've not felt since...

975
01:06:57,070 --> 01:06:58,628
Get me a scanning crew in here
on the double.

976
01:06:58,739 --> 01:07:00,434
I want every part
of this ship checked.

977
01:07:09,516 --> 01:07:11,485
There's no one here.

978
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:22,161
Boy, it's lucky you had
these compartments.

979
01:07:22,262 --> 01:07:23,695
I use them for smuggling.

980
01:07:23,797 --> 01:07:25,425
I never thought I'd
be smuggling myself in 'em.

981
01:07:25,532 --> 01:07:26,898
This is ridiculous.

982
01:07:27,001 --> 01:07:28,262
Even if I could take off...

983
01:07:28,369 --> 01:07:29,768
I'd never get past
the tractor beam.

984
01:07:29,871 --> 01:07:31,338
Leave that to me.

985
01:07:31,438 --> 01:07:34,202
Damn fool, I knew
that you were gonna say that.

986
01:07:34,307 --> 01:07:35,605
Who's the more foolish...

987
01:07:35,710 --> 01:07:37,735
the fool or the fool
who follows him?

988
01:07:37,844 --> 01:07:39,311
Argh!

989
01:07:46,521 --> 01:07:47,920
The ship's all yours.

990
01:07:48,021 --> 01:07:49,922
If the scanners pick up anything...

991
01:07:50,023 --> 01:07:51,923
report it immediately.

992
01:07:52,025 --> 01:07:53,822
All right, let's go.

993
01:08:08,809 --> 01:08:10,173
Hey, down there!

994
01:08:12,213 --> 01:08:14,271
Could you give us a hand
with this?

995
01:08:22,979 --> 01:08:25,971
TK-421, why aren't you
at your post?

996
01:08:26,082 --> 01:08:28,381
TK-421, do you copy?

997
01:08:40,631 --> 01:08:42,496
Take over.
We've got a bad transmitter.

998
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:44,430
I'll see what I can do.

999
01:08:47,137 --> 01:08:49,072
Grrr!

1000
01:09:00,784 --> 01:09:03,810
Between his howling and your blasting
everything in sight...

1001
01:09:03,921 --> 01:09:06,480
it's a wonder the whole station
doesn't know we're here.

1002
01:09:06,590 --> 01:09:08,113
Bring them on!

1003
01:09:08,225 --> 01:09:09,350
I'd prefer a straight fight
to all this sneakin' around.

1004
01:09:09,460 --> 01:09:11,451
We've found the computer outlet, sir.

1005
01:09:11,561 --> 01:09:14,326
Plug in. He should be able to interpret
the entire imperial network.

1006
01:09:24,507 --> 01:09:27,203
He says he's found
the main controls...

1007
01:09:27,310 --> 01:09:29,711
to the power beam that's
holding the ship here.

1008
01:09:29,814 --> 01:09:31,975
He'll try to make the precise location
appear on the monitor.

1009
01:09:32,082 --> 01:09:34,743
The tractor beam is coupled
to the main reactor...

1010
01:09:34,851 --> 01:09:36,319
in seven locations.

1011
01:09:36,420 --> 01:09:37,909
A power loss
at one of the terminals...

1012
01:09:38,021 --> 01:09:40,582
will allow the ship to leave.

1013
01:09:40,690 --> 01:09:43,557
I don't think you boys can help.

1014
01:09:43,661 --> 01:09:45,390
I must go alone.

1015
01:09:45,496 --> 01:09:47,087
Whatever you say.

1016
01:09:47,198 --> 01:09:48,926
I've done more than I bargained for
on this trip already.

1017
01:09:49,033 --> 01:09:50,523
I want to go with you.

1018
01:09:50,634 --> 01:09:52,828
Be patient, Luke.
Stay and watch over the droids.

1019
01:09:52,936 --> 01:09:54,597
They must be delivered safely...

1020
01:09:54,704 --> 01:09:57,730
or other star systems will suffer
the same fate as Alderaan.

1021
01:09:57,841 --> 01:10:01,903
Your destiny lies along
a different path from mine.

1022
01:10:05,114 --> 01:10:08,914
The Force will be with you always.

1023
01:10:15,693 --> 01:10:17,752
Argh argh argh!

1024
01:10:17,862 --> 01:10:19,420
You said it, Chewie.

1025
01:10:19,529 --> 01:10:22,966
Where did you dig up
that old fossil?

1026
01:10:23,067 --> 01:10:24,966
Ben is a great man.

1027
01:10:25,069 --> 01:10:27,594
Yeah, great at getting us
into trouble.

1028
01:10:27,704 --> 01:10:29,069
I didn't hear you give any ideas.

1029
01:10:29,172 --> 01:10:30,537
Well, anything's better
than just hangin' around...

1030
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:31,733
waiting for 'em to pick us up.

1031
01:10:31,841 --> 01:10:32,899
Who do you think...

1032
01:10:34,078 --> 01:10:35,476
What is it?

1033
01:10:35,578 --> 01:10:37,637
I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.

1034
01:10:37,747 --> 01:10:40,113
He says "I've found her"
and keeps repeating "She's here."

1035
01:10:40,216 --> 01:10:42,810
Well, who... who has he found?

1036
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:43,978
Princess Leia.

1037
01:10:44,087 --> 01:10:45,783
The princess?
She's here?!

1038
01:10:45,890 --> 01:10:46,856
Princess?

1039
01:10:46,957 --> 01:10:48,219
Where? Where is she?

1040
01:10:48,324 --> 01:10:49,587
Princess? What's going on?

1041
01:10:54,364 --> 01:10:57,801
Level 5, Detention Block AA-23.

1042
01:11:01,905 --> 01:11:05,273
I'm afraid she's scheduled
to be terminated.

1043
01:11:05,376 --> 01:11:06,399
Oh, no!

1044
01:11:06,510 --> 01:11:07,908
We've got to do something!

1045
01:11:08,011 --> 01:11:09,569
What are you talking about?

1046
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:10,805
The droids belong to her.

1047
01:11:10,914 --> 01:11:11,904
She's the one in the message.

1048
01:11:12,015 --> 01:11:13,141
We got to help her.

1049
01:11:13,250 --> 01:11:14,478
Now look, don't get
any funny ideas.

1050
01:11:14,585 --> 01:11:15,744
The old man wants us
to wait right here.

1051
01:11:15,853 --> 01:11:17,217
But he didn't know
she was here.

1052
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:19,448
Just find a way back into that
detention block.

1053
01:11:19,555 --> 01:11:20,523
I'm not going anywhere.

1054
01:11:20,623 --> 01:11:21,783
They're going to execute her.

1055
01:11:21,891 --> 01:11:23,324
Look, a few minutes ago, you said...

1056
01:11:23,426 --> 01:11:24,416
you didn't want to just wait here
to be captured.

1057
01:11:24,528 --> 01:11:25,516
Now all you want to do is stay?

1058
01:11:25,628 --> 01:11:27,323
Marching into the detention area...

1059
01:11:27,430 --> 01:11:28,591
is not what I had in mind.

1060
01:11:28,698 --> 01:11:29,722
But they're gonna kill her!

1061
01:11:29,832 --> 01:11:31,493
Better her than me.

1062
01:11:39,310 --> 01:11:40,606
She's rich.

1063
01:11:40,711 --> 01:11:43,145
Argh!

1064
01:11:43,247 --> 01:11:44,440
Rich?

1065
01:11:44,547 --> 01:11:46,140
Mm-hmm. Rich, powerful.

1066
01:11:46,250 --> 01:11:49,275
Listen, if you were to rescue her,
the reward would be...

1067
01:11:49,386 --> 01:11:50,546
What?

1068
01:11:50,654 --> 01:11:52,121
Well, more well
than you can imagine.

1069
01:11:52,221 --> 01:11:54,622
I don't know.
I can imagine quite a bit.

1070
01:11:54,725 --> 01:11:55,748
You'll get it.

1071
01:11:55,859 --> 01:11:56,951
I better.

1072
01:11:57,060 --> 01:11:58,493
You will.

1073
01:11:58,595 --> 01:12:00,118
All right, kid.
You better be right about this.

1074
01:12:00,229 --> 01:12:01,253
All right.

1075
01:12:01,364 --> 01:12:02,389
What's your plan?

1076
01:12:02,498 --> 01:12:03,693
Um...

1077
01:12:03,801 --> 01:12:07,362
3PO, hand me those binders there,
will you?

1078
01:12:07,470 --> 01:12:09,462
O.K.

1079
01:12:09,573 --> 01:12:11,699
Now... I'm gonna
put these on you.

1080
01:12:11,809 --> 01:12:12,832
Grrr!

1081
01:12:12,943 --> 01:12:16,878
O.K. Han, you... you put those on.

1082
01:12:16,980 --> 01:12:18,073
Don't worry, Chewie.

1083
01:12:18,181 --> 01:12:19,671
I think I know
what he has in mind.

1084
01:12:19,783 --> 01:12:22,581
Master Luke, sir,
pardon me for asking...

1085
01:12:22,685 --> 01:12:25,519
but what should R2 and I do
if we're discovered here?

1086
01:12:25,622 --> 01:12:27,088
Lock the door.

1087
01:12:27,190 --> 01:12:29,421
And hope they don't have blasters.

1088
01:12:29,525 --> 01:12:31,255
That isn't very reassuring.

1089
01:12:37,001 --> 01:12:38,059
Grrr!

1090
01:12:51,782 --> 01:12:53,180
<i>517 to scanner control.</i>

1091
01:12:53,283 --> 01:12:56,582
<i>517 to scanner control.</i>

1092
01:13:00,090 --> 01:13:02,114
<i>316, report to control.</i>

1093
01:13:05,462 --> 01:13:08,021
<i>53 to upper bay door.</i>

1094
01:13:08,131 --> 01:13:10,760
<i>53 to upper bay door.</i>

1095
01:13:22,746 --> 01:13:25,010
I can't see a thing
in this helmet.

1096
01:13:55,244 --> 01:13:57,907
This is not gonna work.

1097
01:13:58,015 --> 01:13:59,140
Why didn't you say so before?

1098
01:13:59,248 --> 01:14:01,216
I did say so before.

1099
01:14:16,265 --> 01:14:19,632
Where are you taking this... thing?

1100
01:14:19,735 --> 01:14:22,466
Prisoner transfer
from Cell Block 1138.

1101
01:14:22,573 --> 01:14:25,097
I wasn't notified.

1102
01:14:25,208 --> 01:14:27,336
I'll have to clear it.

1103
01:14:32,448 --> 01:14:33,676
Argh!

1104
01:14:33,783 --> 01:14:35,046
Look out! He's loose!

1105
01:14:35,152 --> 01:14:36,118
He'll tear us all apart!

1106
01:14:36,220 --> 01:14:37,516
I'll get him!

1107
01:15:00,777 --> 01:15:01,765
Look out!

1108
01:15:08,018 --> 01:15:09,006
Arrgh!

1109
01:15:12,122 --> 01:15:14,590
We gotta find out which cell
this princess of yours is in.

1110
01:15:14,690 --> 01:15:16,090
Here it is... 2187.

1111
01:15:16,193 --> 01:15:18,752
You go and get her.
I'll hold them here.

1112
01:15:21,698 --> 01:15:24,097
Uh... Uh, everything's
under control.

1113
01:15:24,201 --> 01:15:25,429
Situation normal.

1114
01:15:25,536 --> 01:15:26,764
<i>What happened?</i>

1115
01:15:26,869 --> 01:15:29,270
Had a slight weapons malfunction...

1116
01:15:29,372 --> 01:15:31,603
but, uh, everything's
perfectly all right now.

1117
01:15:31,707 --> 01:15:34,506
We're fine... We're all fine
here now. Thank you.

1118
01:15:34,610 --> 01:15:35,770
How are you?

1119
01:15:35,878 --> 01:15:37,779
<i>We're sending a squad up.</i>

1120
01:15:37,881 --> 01:15:39,279
Uh, negative, negative!

1121
01:15:39,382 --> 01:15:42,011
We have a... a reactor leak
here, uh, now.

1122
01:15:42,118 --> 01:15:43,176
Give us a few minutes
to lock it down.

1123
01:15:43,287 --> 01:15:45,118
Uh, large leak, very dangerous.

1124
01:15:45,221 --> 01:15:47,952
<i>Who is this? What's your
operating number?</i>

1125
01:15:48,057 --> 01:15:49,184
Uh...

1126
01:15:50,394 --> 01:15:51,587
Boring conversation anyway.

1127
01:15:51,694 --> 01:15:54,528
Luke! We're gonna have company!

1128
01:16:07,911 --> 01:16:10,435
Aren't you a little short
for a stormtrooper?

1129
01:16:10,546 --> 01:16:11,536
Huh?

1130
01:16:11,648 --> 01:16:13,114
Oh, the uniform.

1131
01:16:14,818 --> 01:16:16,809
I'm Luke Skywalker.
I'm here to rescue you.

1132
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:18,386
You're who?

1133
01:16:18,488 --> 01:16:19,613
I'm here to rescue you.
I've got your R2 unit.

1134
01:16:19,722 --> 01:16:20,814
I'm here with Ben Kenobi.

1135
01:16:20,923 --> 01:16:22,118
Ben Kenobi?!
Where is he?

1136
01:16:22,225 --> 01:16:23,193
Come on!

1137
01:16:25,061 --> 01:16:26,426
He is here.

1138
01:16:26,529 --> 01:16:28,895
Obi-Wan Kenobi?

1139
01:16:28,998 --> 01:16:30,226
What makes you think so?

1140
01:16:30,333 --> 01:16:32,894
A tremor in the Force.

1141
01:16:33,002 --> 01:16:34,128
The last time I felt it...

1142
01:16:34,238 --> 01:16:36,399
was in the presence
of my old master.

1143
01:16:36,506 --> 01:16:38,974
Surely he must be dead by now.

1144
01:16:39,076 --> 01:16:41,943
Don't underestimate the Force.

1145
01:16:42,045 --> 01:16:43,944
The Jedi are extinct.

1146
01:16:44,046 --> 01:16:46,277
Their fire has gone out of the universe.

1147
01:16:46,382 --> 01:16:49,819
You, my friend, are all that's left
of their religion.

1148
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:51,444
Yes.

1149
01:16:51,555 --> 01:16:52,578
<i>We have an emergency alert...</i>

1150
01:16:52,689 --> 01:16:55,317
<i>in Detention Block AA-23.</i>

1151
01:16:55,425 --> 01:16:56,585
The princess?

1152
01:16:56,693 --> 01:16:57,989
Put all sections on alert.

1153
01:16:58,095 --> 01:16:59,585
Obi-Wan is here.

1154
01:16:59,695 --> 01:17:01,686
The Force is with him.

1155
01:17:01,797 --> 01:17:02,855
If you're right...

1156
01:17:02,966 --> 01:17:04,831
he must not be
allowed to escape.

1157
01:17:04,935 --> 01:17:06,493
Escape is not his plan.

1158
01:17:06,603 --> 01:17:08,264
I must face him alone.

1159
01:17:14,711 --> 01:17:16,940
Argh!

1160
01:17:17,046 --> 01:17:19,105
Get behind me!
Get behind me!

1161
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:31,652
Watch your left.

1162
01:17:31,761 --> 01:17:33,286
They went down the cell bay.

1163
01:17:35,832 --> 01:17:37,458
Can't get out that way.

1164
01:17:37,567 --> 01:17:39,158
Looks like you managed to cut off
our only escape route.

1165
01:17:39,269 --> 01:17:43,637
Maybe you'd like it back in your cell,
Your Highness.

1166
01:17:43,739 --> 01:17:45,104
C-3PO, C-3PO!

1167
01:17:45,207 --> 01:17:46,505
<i>Yes, sir?</i>

1168
01:17:46,609 --> 01:17:48,338
Are there any other ways
out of the cell bay?

1169
01:17:48,444 --> 01:17:50,140
We've been cut off!

1170
01:17:52,349 --> 01:17:54,578
What was that?
I didn't copy.

1171
01:17:54,685 --> 01:17:58,051
I said all systems have been alerted
to your presence, sir.

1172
01:17:58,154 --> 01:17:59,985
The main entrance seems
to be the only way in or out.

1173
01:18:00,090 --> 01:18:03,059
All other information
on your level is restricted.

1174
01:18:03,159 --> 01:18:04,684
Open up in there!

1175
01:18:04,795 --> 01:18:06,659
Open up in there!

1176
01:18:06,762 --> 01:18:08,423
Oh, no!

1177
01:18:08,532 --> 01:18:10,090
There isn't any other way out!

1178
01:18:12,269 --> 01:18:14,065
Argh!

1179
01:18:15,706 --> 01:18:17,935
I can't hold them off forever!
Now what?!

1180
01:18:18,041 --> 01:18:19,770
This is some rescue!

1181
01:18:19,876 --> 01:18:21,570
You came in here, and you didn't
have a plan for getting out?

1182
01:18:21,677 --> 01:18:23,668
He's the brains, sweetheart!

1183
01:18:23,779 --> 01:18:24,939
Well, I didn't...

1184
01:18:26,615 --> 01:18:27,604
What the hell are you doing?

1185
01:18:27,717 --> 01:18:30,083
Somebody has to save our skins.

1186
01:18:32,389 --> 01:18:34,083
Into the garbage chute, flyboy.

1187
01:18:40,963 --> 01:18:42,625
- Get in there!
- Arrgh!

1188
01:18:42,733 --> 01:18:45,600
Get in there, you big furry oaf!

1189
01:18:45,702 --> 01:18:46,862
I don't care what you smell.

1190
01:18:46,970 --> 01:18:49,802
Get in there, and
don't worry about it.

1191
01:18:52,475 --> 01:18:53,943
Wonderful girl!

1192
01:18:56,046 --> 01:18:57,069
Either I'm going to kill her...

1193
01:18:57,180 --> 01:18:59,273
or I'm beginning to like her.

1194
01:19:00,817 --> 01:19:03,512
Get in there!

1195
01:19:06,489 --> 01:19:08,515
Aah!

1196
01:19:10,327 --> 01:19:11,453
Ah!

1197
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:13,051
Argh!

1198
01:19:14,930 --> 01:19:17,729
The garbage chute was
a really wonderful idea.

1199
01:19:17,833 --> 01:19:21,326
What an incredible smell
you've discovered!

1200
01:19:23,939 --> 01:19:26,170
Let's get out of here.

1201
01:19:26,275 --> 01:19:27,606
Get away from there.

1202
01:19:27,711 --> 01:19:28,677
No, wait!

1203
01:19:35,418 --> 01:19:36,476
Will you forget it?!
I already tried it!

1204
01:19:36,586 --> 01:19:37,984
It's magnetically sealed.

1205
01:19:38,087 --> 01:19:40,146
Put that thing away!
You're gonna get us all killed!

1206
01:19:40,256 --> 01:19:42,190
Absolutely, Your Worship.

1207
01:19:42,292 --> 01:19:44,623
Look, I had everything under control
till you led us down here!

1208
01:19:44,728 --> 01:19:46,252
Ya know, it's not
gonna take 'em long...

1209
01:19:46,363 --> 01:19:47,853
to figure out
what happened to us!

1210
01:19:47,963 --> 01:19:49,863
It could be worse.

1211
01:19:49,966 --> 01:19:50,932
Woorr!

1212
01:19:53,603 --> 01:19:54,864
It's worse.

1213
01:19:54,970 --> 01:19:56,494
There's something alive in here.

1214
01:19:56,605 --> 01:19:58,005
That's your imagination.

1215
01:19:58,108 --> 01:20:00,905
Something just moved past my leg.

1216
01:20:02,612 --> 01:20:04,636
Look! Did you see that?

1217
01:20:04,747 --> 01:20:05,715
What?

1218
01:20:05,815 --> 01:20:07,511
Grrr!

1219
01:20:26,002 --> 01:20:26,969
Woorr!

1220
01:20:27,069 --> 01:20:28,037
Kid!

1221
01:20:28,137 --> 01:20:29,127
Luke!

1222
01:20:29,238 --> 01:20:30,466
Luke!

1223
01:20:30,573 --> 01:20:31,541
Luke!

1224
01:20:32,742 --> 01:20:33,868
Luke!

1225
01:20:37,581 --> 01:20:38,569
Aah!

1226
01:20:38,681 --> 01:20:39,671
Woorr!

1227
01:20:39,783 --> 01:20:43,310
Luke! Luke, grab hold of this!

1228
01:20:43,420 --> 01:20:45,854
Blast it!
My gun's jammed.

1229
01:20:45,956 --> 01:20:47,582
Where?

1230
01:20:47,690 --> 01:20:48,658
Anywhere!

1231
01:20:56,533 --> 01:20:57,556
Luke, Luke!

1232
01:21:21,291 --> 01:21:22,917
Help him!

1233
01:21:23,025 --> 01:21:24,118
What happened?

1234
01:21:24,226 --> 01:21:25,353
I don't know.

1235
01:21:25,462 --> 01:21:27,657
It just let go of me
and disappeared.

1236
01:21:33,970 --> 01:21:37,701
I got a bad feeling about this.

1237
01:21:37,806 --> 01:21:40,037
Grrr!

1238
01:21:41,978 --> 01:21:43,036
The walls are moving!

1239
01:21:43,145 --> 01:21:44,443
Don't just stand there!

1240
01:21:44,547 --> 01:21:47,015
Try and brace it with something.

1241
01:21:52,154 --> 01:21:54,122
Grrr!

1242
01:21:54,224 --> 01:21:55,690
Help me!

1243
01:22:08,371 --> 01:22:09,395
Wait a minute!

1244
01:22:12,207 --> 01:22:13,903
3PO!

1245
01:22:14,010 --> 01:22:16,341
Come in, 3PO!

1246
01:22:16,445 --> 01:22:17,970
<i>3PO!</i>

1247
01:22:18,081 --> 01:22:19,912
<i>Where could he be?</i>

1248
01:22:24,621 --> 01:22:26,588
Take over. See to him.

1249
01:22:28,925 --> 01:22:31,086
Look, there.

1250
01:22:32,462 --> 01:22:33,860
They're madmen.

1251
01:22:33,963 --> 01:22:35,261
They're heading for the prison level.

1252
01:22:35,364 --> 01:22:36,854
If you hurry, you might catch them.

1253
01:22:36,966 --> 01:22:38,434
Follow me.

1254
01:22:42,572 --> 01:22:44,596
You stand guard.

1255
01:22:48,478 --> 01:22:49,944
Come on.

1256
01:22:53,649 --> 01:22:55,117
Oh!

1257
01:22:58,654 --> 01:23:02,055
All this excitement has overrun
the circuits in my counterpart here.

1258
01:23:02,158 --> 01:23:05,615
If you don't mind, I'd like to take him
down to maintenance.

1259
01:23:05,729 --> 01:23:07,195
All right.

1260
01:23:19,009 --> 01:23:20,033
3PO!

1261
01:23:20,143 --> 01:23:21,507
Come in, 3PO!

1262
01:23:21,610 --> 01:23:23,043
3PO!

1263
01:23:23,145 --> 01:23:24,545
Get on top!

1264
01:23:24,648 --> 01:23:25,807
I can't.

1265
01:23:25,914 --> 01:23:28,815
Where could he be?! 3PO!

1266
01:23:28,917 --> 01:23:30,976
3PO, will you come in!

1267
01:23:31,087 --> 01:23:32,485
They aren't here.

1268
01:23:32,588 --> 01:23:33,817
Something must have
happened to them.

1269
01:23:33,922 --> 01:23:35,322
See if they've been captured.

1270
01:23:35,425 --> 01:23:36,413
Hurry.

1271
01:23:39,863 --> 01:23:41,489
One thing's for sure...

1272
01:23:41,597 --> 01:23:42,997
we're all gonna be a lot thinner.

1273
01:23:45,769 --> 01:23:47,760
Get on top of it.

1274
01:23:47,871 --> 01:23:48,962
I'm trying.

1275
01:23:53,943 --> 01:23:55,774
Thank goodness they haven't found them.

1276
01:23:55,878 --> 01:23:56,903
Where could they be?

1277
01:23:59,448 --> 01:24:01,006
"Use the comlink"?

1278
01:24:01,117 --> 01:24:03,779
Oh, my. I forgot.
I turned it off.

1279
01:24:06,523 --> 01:24:09,117
Are you there, sir?

1280
01:24:09,225 --> 01:24:11,021
3PO!

1281
01:24:11,127 --> 01:24:12,185
We've had some problems.

1282
01:24:12,295 --> 01:24:13,421
Will you shut up
and listen to me?!

1283
01:24:13,529 --> 01:24:15,225
Shut down all
the garbage mashers...

1284
01:24:15,331 --> 01:24:16,389
on the detention level, will ya?!

1285
01:24:16,498 --> 01:24:17,556
Do you copy!?

1286
01:24:17,667 --> 01:24:21,694
Shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level!

1287
01:24:21,805 --> 01:24:24,364
Shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level!

1288
01:24:24,474 --> 01:24:26,203
No! Shut them all down. Hurry!

1289
01:24:38,555 --> 01:24:39,578
What?

1290
01:24:39,689 --> 01:24:41,212
Ha ha!

1291
01:24:43,326 --> 01:24:45,418
Listen to them.
They're dying, R2!

1292
01:24:45,528 --> 01:24:47,119
Curse my metal body!

1293
01:24:47,229 --> 01:24:51,131
I wasn't fast enough.
It's all my fault! My poor master.

1294
01:24:51,234 --> 01:24:52,792
We're all right! You did great!

1295
01:24:52,902 --> 01:24:55,336
Hey! Open the pressure
maintenance hatch...

1296
01:24:55,438 --> 01:24:57,599
on unit number...
Where are we?

1297
01:24:57,707 --> 01:25:01,073
3263827!

1298
01:25:45,421 --> 01:25:48,447
If we can just avoid
any more female advice...

1299
01:25:48,557 --> 01:25:50,787
we ought to be able
to get outta here.

1300
01:25:50,894 --> 01:25:52,360
Well, let's get moving.

1301
01:25:52,462 --> 01:25:53,451
Grrr!

1302
01:25:53,563 --> 01:25:55,462
Where are you going?

1303
01:25:55,564 --> 01:25:56,622
Aw...

1304
01:25:56,733 --> 01:25:58,131
No, wait! They'll hear!

1305
01:25:59,335 --> 01:26:01,234
Come here, you big coward.

1306
01:26:01,337 --> 01:26:02,326
Chewie, come here.

1307
01:26:02,438 --> 01:26:03,802
Listen...

1308
01:26:03,907 --> 01:26:06,501
I don't know who you are
or where you came from...

1309
01:26:06,609 --> 01:26:09,543
but from now on, you do
as I tell you, O. K?

1310
01:26:09,645 --> 01:26:11,579
Look, Your Worshipfulness...

1311
01:26:11,680 --> 01:26:13,581
let's get one thing straight.

1312
01:26:13,682 --> 01:26:16,515
I take orders from
just one person... me.

1313
01:26:16,618 --> 01:26:18,644
It's a wonder you're still alive.

1314
01:26:18,755 --> 01:26:22,020
Will somebody get this big
walking carpet out of my way?

1315
01:26:22,125 --> 01:26:25,252
No reward is worth this.

1316
01:26:34,337 --> 01:26:36,532
Give me regular reports, please.

1317
01:26:36,639 --> 01:26:37,730
Right.

1318
01:26:39,943 --> 01:26:41,341
Do you know what's going on?

1319
01:26:41,444 --> 01:26:43,172
Maybe it's another drill.

1320
01:26:47,050 --> 01:26:49,882
You seen that new VT-16?

1321
01:26:49,985 --> 01:26:52,351
Yeah. Some of the other guys
were telling me about it.

1322
01:26:52,454 --> 01:26:54,547
They say it's... it's quite a thing to see...

1323
01:26:54,657 --> 01:26:56,750
What was that?

1324
01:26:56,859 --> 01:26:58,417
Ah, it's nothing. Outgassing.

1325
01:26:58,528 --> 01:26:59,494
Don't worry about it.

1326
01:27:04,868 --> 01:27:05,926
There she is.

1327
01:27:06,034 --> 01:27:07,262
C-3PO? Do you copy?

1328
01:27:07,369 --> 01:27:08,359
Yes, sir.

1329
01:27:08,470 --> 01:27:10,404
- Are you safe?
- For the moment.

1330
01:27:10,506 --> 01:27:12,804
We're in the main hangar
across from the ship.

1331
01:27:14,644 --> 01:27:16,235
We're right above you.
Stand by.

1332
01:27:16,345 --> 01:27:18,041
You came in that thing?

1333
01:27:18,148 --> 01:27:19,206
You're braver than I thought.

1334
01:27:19,314 --> 01:27:20,612
Nice! Come on.

1335
01:27:24,654 --> 01:27:25,677
It's them!

1336
01:27:25,788 --> 01:27:26,756
Blast them!

1337
01:27:27,856 --> 01:27:28,881
Get back to the ship!

1338
01:27:28,992 --> 01:27:30,425
Where are you going?
Come back!

1339
01:27:30,527 --> 01:27:31,551
He certainly has courage.

1340
01:27:31,661 --> 01:27:32,992
What good will it do us...

1341
01:27:33,095 --> 01:27:35,291
if he gets himself killed?
Come on.

1342
01:27:35,398 --> 01:27:38,993
Aah!

1343
01:27:40,502 --> 01:27:42,766
Aah!

1344
01:27:59,021 --> 01:28:00,148
Whoop!

1345
01:28:00,256 --> 01:28:02,884
I think we took a wrong turn.

1346
01:28:07,197 --> 01:28:08,163
There's no lock.

1347
01:28:12,202 --> 01:28:13,463
That oughta hold them
for a while.

1348
01:28:13,569 --> 01:28:15,060
Quick! We've got to get across.

1349
01:28:15,171 --> 01:28:16,899
Find the controls
that extend the bridge.

1350
01:28:17,006 --> 01:28:18,404
I think I just blasted it.

1351
01:28:18,507 --> 01:28:20,305
They're coming through!

1352
01:28:42,631 --> 01:28:43,655
Here, hold this.

1353
01:29:00,550 --> 01:29:01,676
Here they come.

1354
01:29:11,828 --> 01:29:13,625
For luck.

1355
01:29:19,502 --> 01:29:22,436
We think they may be splitting up.

1356
01:29:22,538 --> 01:29:25,804
They may be on Level 5 and 6 now, sir.

1357
01:29:39,354 --> 01:29:40,480
Where could they be?

1358
01:29:45,328 --> 01:29:47,228
Close the blast doors!

1359
01:29:54,604 --> 01:29:56,833
Open the blast doors!
Open the blast doors!

1360
01:30:15,190 --> 01:30:17,591
I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.

1361
01:30:17,694 --> 01:30:19,217
We meet again at last.

1362
01:30:19,328 --> 01:30:22,422
The circle is now complete.

1363
01:30:22,532 --> 01:30:25,000
When I left you,
I was but the learner.

1364
01:30:25,100 --> 01:30:27,194
<i>Now I am the master.</i>

1365
01:30:27,302 --> 01:30:30,203
Only a master of evil, Darth.

1366
01:30:49,591 --> 01:30:51,890
Your powers are weak, old man.

1367
01:30:51,994 --> 01:30:53,587
You can't win, Darth.

1368
01:30:53,695 --> 01:30:55,630
If you strike me down...

1369
01:30:55,731 --> 01:30:59,132
I shall become more powerful
than you can possibly imagine.

1370
01:31:05,774 --> 01:31:08,573
You should not have come back.

1371
01:31:34,369 --> 01:31:37,032
Didn't we just leave this party?

1372
01:31:38,740 --> 01:31:39,765
What kept you?

1373
01:31:39,876 --> 01:31:40,864
We, uh, ran into some old friends.

1374
01:31:40,976 --> 01:31:41,966
The ship all right?

1375
01:31:42,078 --> 01:31:43,545
It seems O.K.,
if we can get to it.

1376
01:31:43,645 --> 01:31:45,738
I just hope the old man got
the tractor beam out of commission.

1377
01:32:00,296 --> 01:32:01,524
Look!

1378
01:32:05,134 --> 01:32:06,998
Come on, R2, we're going.

1379
01:32:08,837 --> 01:32:09,895
Now's our chance! Go!

1380
01:32:13,775 --> 01:32:14,743
Ben?

1381
01:32:30,292 --> 01:32:31,988
No!

1382
01:32:40,103 --> 01:32:41,229
Come on!

1383
01:32:41,337 --> 01:32:42,304
Come on!

1384
01:32:42,404 --> 01:32:43,837
Come on!

1385
01:32:43,939 --> 01:32:45,065
Luke, it's too late!

1386
01:32:45,173 --> 01:32:46,936
Blast the door, kid!

1387
01:32:56,685 --> 01:32:58,949
<i>Run, Luke, run!</i>

1388
01:33:01,056 --> 01:33:03,923
I hope that old man got that
tractor beam out of commission...

1389
01:33:04,027 --> 01:33:06,621
or this is gonna be a real short trip.
O.K. Hit it!

1390
01:33:17,073 --> 01:33:18,972
Aargh!

1391
01:33:37,193 --> 01:33:39,387
We're coming up
on their sentry ships.

1392
01:33:39,494 --> 01:33:41,155
Hold them off.

1393
01:33:41,264 --> 01:33:43,110
Angle the deflector shields
while I charge up the main guns.

1394
01:33:43,145 --> 01:33:44,957
Angle the deflector shields
while I charge up the main guns.

1395
01:33:52,542 --> 01:33:55,010
I can't believe he's gone.

1396
01:33:57,680 --> 01:34:00,148
There wasn't anything
you could have done.

1397
01:34:00,248 --> 01:34:03,149
Come on, buddy.
We're not out of this yet.

1398
01:34:19,301 --> 01:34:22,328
You in, kid?
O.K., stay sharp.

1399
01:34:33,216 --> 01:34:34,341
Here they come.

1400
01:34:52,335 --> 01:34:54,199
They're coming in too fast!

1401
01:35:02,177 --> 01:35:03,667
We've lost the lateral controls!

1402
01:35:03,779 --> 01:35:06,042
Don't worry.
She'll hold together.

1403
01:35:07,582 --> 01:35:09,551
Hear me, baby?
Hold together.

1404
01:35:26,601 --> 01:35:27,569
Ha ha!

1405
01:35:31,707 --> 01:35:33,230
Got him! I got him!

1406
01:35:33,341 --> 01:35:35,640
Great, kid!
Don't get cocky.

1407
01:35:37,046 --> 01:35:38,672
There's still two more
of them out there!

1408
01:36:12,582 --> 01:36:13,947
That's it! We did it!

1409
01:36:14,050 --> 01:36:16,279
We did it!

1410
01:36:16,385 --> 01:36:18,876
Help! I think I'm melting!
This is all your fault!

1411
01:36:26,828 --> 01:36:28,228
Are they away?

1412
01:36:28,331 --> 01:36:31,390
They've just made the jump
into hyperspace.

1413
01:36:31,500 --> 01:36:35,833
You're sure the homing beacon
is secure aboard their ship?

1414
01:36:35,938 --> 01:36:38,634
I'm taking an awful risk, Vader.

1415
01:36:38,740 --> 01:36:40,503
This had better work.

1416
01:36:40,676 --> 01:36:43,405
Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh?

1417
01:36:43,511 --> 01:36:46,605
You know, sometimes
I amaze even myself.

1418
01:36:46,716 --> 01:36:48,979
That doesn't sound too hard.

1419
01:36:49,085 --> 01:36:50,416
They let us go.

1420
01:36:50,519 --> 01:36:51,780
It's the only explanation...

1421
01:36:51,886 --> 01:36:53,444
for the ease of our escape.

1422
01:36:53,555 --> 01:36:54,648
Easy? You call that easy?

1423
01:36:54,756 --> 01:36:55,746
They're tracking us.

1424
01:36:55,858 --> 01:36:57,519
Not this ship, sister.

1425
01:36:57,627 --> 01:37:01,323
At least the information
in R2 is still intact.

1426
01:37:01,430 --> 01:37:03,091
What's so important?
What's he carrying?

1427
01:37:03,198 --> 01:37:06,100
The technical readouts
of that battle station.

1428
01:37:06,202 --> 01:37:08,761
I only hope that
when the data's analyzed...

1429
01:37:08,871 --> 01:37:10,462
a weakness can be found.

1430
01:37:10,573 --> 01:37:12,096
It's not over yet.

1431
01:37:12,207 --> 01:37:13,936
It is for me, sister.

1432
01:37:14,042 --> 01:37:15,771
Look, I ain't in this
for your revolution...

1433
01:37:15,877 --> 01:37:17,708
and I'm not in it for you, Princess.

1434
01:37:17,813 --> 01:37:19,041
I expect to be well paid.

1435
01:37:19,148 --> 01:37:20,341
I'm in it for the money.

1436
01:37:20,448 --> 01:37:22,439
You needn't worry
about your reward.

1437
01:37:22,551 --> 01:37:24,143
If money is all that you love...

1438
01:37:24,252 --> 01:37:26,720
then that's what you'll receive.

1439
01:37:28,757 --> 01:37:30,692
Your friend is quite a mercenary.

1440
01:37:30,792 --> 01:37:33,023
I wonder if he really cares
about anything...

1441
01:37:33,128 --> 01:37:34,618
or anybody.

1442
01:37:34,729 --> 01:37:36,220
I care.

1443
01:37:42,771 --> 01:37:45,296
So...

1444
01:37:45,408 --> 01:37:46,898
what do you think of her, Han?

1445
01:37:47,009 --> 01:37:48,873
I'm trying not to, kid.

1446
01:37:48,978 --> 01:37:51,037
Good.

1447
01:37:54,417 --> 01:37:57,386
Still, she's got a lot of spirit.

1448
01:37:59,488 --> 01:38:00,886
I don't know.
What do you think?

1449
01:38:00,989 --> 01:38:02,514
You think a princess
and a guy like me...

1450
01:38:02,625 --> 01:38:04,387
No!

1451
01:38:50,639 --> 01:38:51,605
You're safe.

1452
01:38:51,707 --> 01:38:52,969
When we heard about Alderaan...

1453
01:38:53,074 --> 01:38:54,269
we feared the worst.

1454
01:38:54,377 --> 01:38:56,072
We have no time
for sorrows, Commander.

1455
01:38:56,177 --> 01:38:57,975
You must use the information
in this R2 unit...

1456
01:38:58,079 --> 01:38:59,046
to help plan the attack.

1457
01:38:59,148 --> 01:39:00,614
It's our only hope.

1458
01:39:22,505 --> 01:39:23,664
Yes.

1459
01:39:23,773 --> 01:39:25,239
<i>We're approaching
the planet Yavin.</i>

1460
01:39:25,341 --> 01:39:27,206
<i>The rebel base is on a moon
on the far side.</i>

1461
01:39:27,309 --> 01:39:29,868
<i>We are preparing
to orbit the planet.</i>

1462
01:39:38,587 --> 01:39:40,612
The battle station
is heavily shielded...

1463
01:39:40,722 --> 01:39:42,520
and carries a firepower...

1464
01:39:42,625 --> 01:39:44,592
greater than half the starfleet.

1465
01:39:44,693 --> 01:39:48,993
Its defenses are designed around
a direct large-scale assault.

1466
01:39:49,097 --> 01:39:54,364
A small, one-man fighter should be able
to penetrate the outer defense.

1467
01:39:54,470 --> 01:39:56,699
Pardon me for asking, sir...

1468
01:39:56,805 --> 01:39:59,707
but what good are snub fighters
going to be against that?

1469
01:39:59,809 --> 01:40:03,336
The Empire doesn't consider
a small, one-man fighter...

1470
01:40:03,445 --> 01:40:04,470
to be any threat...

1471
01:40:04,579 --> 01:40:07,344
or they'd have a tighter defense.

1472
01:40:07,449 --> 01:40:10,510
An analysis of the plans
provided by Princess Leia...

1473
01:40:10,618 --> 01:40:13,884
has demonstrated a weakness
in the battle station.

1474
01:40:13,988 --> 01:40:16,719
The approach will not be easy.

1475
01:40:16,826 --> 01:40:19,988
You're required to maneuver
straight down this trench...

1476
01:40:20,095 --> 01:40:23,462
and skim the surface
to this point.

1477
01:40:23,565 --> 01:40:26,228
The target area
is only 2 meters wide.

1478
01:40:26,335 --> 01:40:28,529
It's a small thermal exhaust port...

1479
01:40:28,636 --> 01:40:31,162
right below the main port.

1480
01:40:31,273 --> 01:40:34,400
The shaft leads directly
to the reactor system.

1481
01:40:34,510 --> 01:40:37,171
A precise hit will start
a chain reaction...

1482
01:40:37,279 --> 01:40:39,509
which should destroy the station.

1483
01:40:39,614 --> 01:40:43,210
Only a precise hit will
set up a chain reaction.

1484
01:40:43,319 --> 01:40:44,649
The shaft is ray-shielded...

1485
01:40:44,752 --> 01:40:46,481
so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.

1486
01:40:46,588 --> 01:40:49,056
That's impossible,
even for a computer.

1487
01:40:49,158 --> 01:40:52,594
It's not impossible. I used to bull's-eye
womp rats in my T-16 back home.

1488
01:40:52,694 --> 01:40:55,095
They're not much bigger
than 2 meters.

1489
01:40:55,197 --> 01:40:58,597
Then man your ships,
and may the Force be with you.

1490
01:41:06,641 --> 01:41:09,109
<i>Orbiting the planet
at maximum velocity.</i>

1491
01:41:09,211 --> 01:41:11,179
<i>The moon with the rebel base...</i>

1492
01:41:11,279 --> 01:41:13,578
<i>will be in range in 30 minutes.</i>

1493
01:41:13,681 --> 01:41:16,014
This will be a day long remembered.

1494
01:41:16,118 --> 01:41:18,551
It has seen the end of Kenobi...

1495
01:41:18,654 --> 01:41:23,181
and will soon see the end
of the rebellion.

1496
01:41:26,729 --> 01:41:30,095
<i>All flight crews,
man your stations.</i>

1497
01:41:30,198 --> 01:41:33,100
<i>All flight crews,
man your stations.</i>

1498
01:41:35,503 --> 01:41:38,597
So... you got your reward
and you're just leaving, then?

1499
01:41:38,707 --> 01:41:40,197
That's right. Yeah.

1500
01:41:40,309 --> 01:41:44,039
I got some old debts I got
to pay off with this stuff.

1501
01:41:44,145 --> 01:41:45,875
And even if I didn't...

1502
01:41:45,980 --> 01:41:48,609
you don't think I'd be fool enough
to stick around here, do ya?

1503
01:41:48,716 --> 01:41:50,377
Why don't you come with us?

1504
01:41:50,485 --> 01:41:52,317
You're pretty good in a fight.
We could use ya.

1505
01:41:52,421 --> 01:41:55,322
Come on. Why don't you
take a look around?

1506
01:41:55,423 --> 01:41:56,755
You know what's about to happen...

1507
01:41:56,859 --> 01:41:58,155
what they're up against.

1508
01:41:58,260 --> 01:41:59,453
They could use
a good pilot like you.

1509
01:41:59,561 --> 01:42:01,051
You're turning
your back on them.

1510
01:42:01,162 --> 01:42:03,563
What good's a reward
if you ain't around to use it?

1511
01:42:03,666 --> 01:42:05,565
Besides, attacking
that battle station...

1512
01:42:05,667 --> 01:42:06,725
ain't my idea of courage.

1513
01:42:06,835 --> 01:42:09,599
It's more like... suicide.

1514
01:42:10,838 --> 01:42:11,896
All right.

1515
01:42:12,006 --> 01:42:14,305
Take care of yourself, Han.

1516
01:42:14,409 --> 01:42:16,970
I guess that's what
you're best at, isn't it?

1517
01:42:17,078 --> 01:42:18,409
Hey, Luke.

1518
01:42:21,716 --> 01:42:24,150
May the Force be with you.

1519
01:42:27,088 --> 01:42:28,078
Argh!

1520
01:42:28,189 --> 01:42:30,488
Argh!

1521
01:42:30,592 --> 01:42:31,923
What are you looking at?

1522
01:42:32,027 --> 01:42:33,823
I know what I'm doing.

1523
01:42:38,199 --> 01:42:41,658
<i>All pilots to your stations.</i>

1524
01:42:41,770 --> 01:42:43,738
<i>All pilots to your stations.</i>

1525
01:42:48,978 --> 01:42:50,444
What's wrong?

1526
01:42:50,546 --> 01:42:52,036
Oh, it's Han.

1527
01:42:52,146 --> 01:42:54,377
I don't know.
I really thought he'd change his mind.

1528
01:42:54,483 --> 01:42:56,109
He's got to follow his own path.

1529
01:42:56,217 --> 01:42:58,048
No one can choose it for him.

1530
01:42:58,153 --> 01:43:02,248
I only wish Ben were here.

1531
01:43:09,597 --> 01:43:11,565
<i>Open main launch tubes.</i>

1532
01:43:12,635 --> 01:43:14,534
<i>Main launch tubes opening, sir.</i>

1533
01:43:14,636 --> 01:43:15,661
Hey, Luke!

1534
01:43:15,770 --> 01:43:16,828
Biggs!

1535
01:43:16,939 --> 01:43:18,530
I don't believe it.
How are you?

1536
01:43:18,640 --> 01:43:19,664
Great.

1537
01:43:19,774 --> 01:43:20,764
Hey, coming up?

1538
01:43:20,876 --> 01:43:22,172
I'll be right up there with you...

1539
01:43:22,277 --> 01:43:23,971
and have I got stories to tell you.

1540
01:43:24,078 --> 01:43:27,344
Are you sure
you can handle this ship?

1541
01:43:27,448 --> 01:43:30,145
Sir, Luke is
the best bush pilot...

1542
01:43:30,252 --> 01:43:31,878
in the outer-rim territories.

1543
01:43:31,987 --> 01:43:33,078
You'll do all right.

1544
01:43:33,188 --> 01:43:34,519
Thank you, sir. I'll try.

1545
01:43:34,622 --> 01:43:35,783
I gotta get aboard.

1546
01:43:35,890 --> 01:43:37,448
We'll hear all your stories when
we get back, all right?

1547
01:43:37,559 --> 01:43:38,582
All right.

1548
01:43:38,694 --> 01:43:39,752
Hey, Biggs.

1549
01:43:39,862 --> 01:43:41,090
I told you I'd make it someday.

1550
01:43:41,195 --> 01:43:42,253
It'll be like old times, Luke.

1551
01:43:42,363 --> 01:43:44,092
They'll never stop us.

1552
01:43:47,269 --> 01:43:48,997
Hey, this R2 unit of yours
seems a bit beat up.

1553
01:43:49,104 --> 01:43:50,162
You want a new one?

1554
01:43:50,271 --> 01:43:51,899
Not on your life.

1555
01:43:52,006 --> 01:43:53,405
That little droid and I have
been through a lot together.

1556
01:43:53,509 --> 01:43:54,497
You O.K., R2?

1557
01:43:56,211 --> 01:43:58,542
Good.

1558
01:43:58,646 --> 01:44:01,945
<i>Gold squadron,
begin takeoff procedure.</i>

1559
01:44:02,051 --> 01:44:04,679
Hang on tight, R2.
You've got to come back.

1560
01:44:06,954 --> 01:44:08,945
You wouldn't want my life
to get boring, would you?

1561
01:44:57,338 --> 01:45:01,502
<i>Luke, the Force will be with you.</i>

1562
01:45:12,020 --> 01:45:13,487
<i>Standby alert.</i>

1563
01:45:13,588 --> 01:45:15,819
<i>Death Star approaching.</i>

1564
01:45:15,923 --> 01:45:19,051
<i>Estimated time to firing range,
15 minutes.</i>

1565
01:45:32,207 --> 01:45:33,367
All wings report in.

1566
01:45:33,475 --> 01:45:34,442
Red 10 standing by.

1567
01:45:34,542 --> 01:45:35,600
Red Seven standing by.

1568
01:45:35,711 --> 01:45:36,769
Red Three standing by.

1569
01:45:36,878 --> 01:45:38,106
Red Six standing by.

1570
01:45:38,212 --> 01:45:39,612
Red Nine standing by.

1571
01:45:39,715 --> 01:45:40,681
Red Two standing by.

1572
01:45:40,783 --> 01:45:41,771
Red 11 standing by.

1573
01:45:41,884 --> 01:45:43,715
Red Five standing by.

1574
01:45:45,119 --> 01:45:47,020
Lock S-foils in attack position.

1575
01:45:51,292 --> 01:45:53,283
We're passing through
the magnetic field.

1576
01:45:53,395 --> 01:45:54,487
Hold tight.

1577
01:45:54,595 --> 01:45:57,724
Switch your deflectors on.
Double front.

1578
01:46:00,735 --> 01:46:02,498
Look at the size of that thing!

1579
01:46:02,604 --> 01:46:05,198
Cut the chatter, Red Two.
Accelerate to attack speed.

1580
01:46:08,609 --> 01:46:09,634
This is it, boys.

1581
01:46:09,744 --> 01:46:11,337
Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.

1582
01:46:11,445 --> 01:46:12,640
I copy, Gold Leader.

1583
01:46:12,747 --> 01:46:14,238
We're starting for
the target shaft now.

1584
01:46:14,349 --> 01:46:15,372
We're in position.

1585
01:46:15,484 --> 01:46:16,576
I'm going to cut across the axis...

1586
01:46:16,685 --> 01:46:17,878
and try and draw their fire.

1587
01:46:32,301 --> 01:46:33,927
Heavy fire, boss, 23 degrees.

1588
01:46:34,036 --> 01:46:35,560
I see it. Stay low.

1589
01:46:43,011 --> 01:46:44,501
This is Red Five. I'm going in.

1590
01:46:49,016 --> 01:46:50,109
Luke, pull up!

1591
01:46:51,819 --> 01:46:52,787
Are you all right?

1592
01:46:52,887 --> 01:46:54,115
I got a little cooked, but I'm O.K.

1593
01:47:00,028 --> 01:47:01,689
We count 30 rebel ships, Lord Vader...

1594
01:47:01,796 --> 01:47:02,786
but they're so small...

1595
01:47:02,898 --> 01:47:04,091
they're evading our turbolasers.

1596
01:47:04,198 --> 01:47:06,064
We'll have to destroy
them ship to ship.

1597
01:47:06,167 --> 01:47:08,158
Get the crews to their fighters.

1598
01:47:10,805 --> 01:47:12,966
Watch yourself.
There's a lot of fire coming...

1599
01:47:13,074 --> 01:47:14,975
from the right side
of that deflection tower.

1600
01:47:15,077 --> 01:47:16,043
I'm on it.

1601
01:47:16,144 --> 01:47:18,135
I'm going in.
Cover me, Porkins.

1602
01:47:18,247 --> 01:47:19,509
I'm right with you,
Red Three.

1603
01:47:25,921 --> 01:47:26,944
I've got a problem here.

1604
01:47:27,055 --> 01:47:28,146
Eject.

1605
01:47:28,256 --> 01:47:29,224
I can hold it.

1606
01:47:29,323 --> 01:47:30,291
Pull up!

1607
01:47:30,391 --> 01:47:33,020
No, I'm all... Aah!

1608
01:47:35,529 --> 01:47:37,622
<i>The rebel base
will be in firing range...</i>

1609
01:47:37,733 --> 01:47:39,222
<i>in seven minutes.</i>

1610
01:47:42,337 --> 01:47:45,170
<i>Luke, trust your feelings.</i>

1611
01:47:52,948 --> 01:47:56,975
Squad leaders, we've
picked up a new group of signals.

1612
01:47:57,085 --> 01:47:58,746
Enemy fighters coming your way.

1613
01:47:58,854 --> 01:48:00,515
My scope's negative.
I don't see anything.

1614
01:48:00,622 --> 01:48:01,782
Pick up your visual scanning.

1615
01:48:01,890 --> 01:48:02,856
Here they come.

1616
01:48:06,094 --> 01:48:07,823
Watch it. You've got one
on your tail.

1617
01:48:13,201 --> 01:48:14,167
I'm hit!

1618
01:48:15,537 --> 01:48:16,628
You've picked one up!
Watch it!

1619
01:48:16,738 --> 01:48:18,069
I can't see it!

1620
01:48:20,042 --> 01:48:21,737
He's on me tight.
I can't shake him!

1621
01:48:23,478 --> 01:48:24,444
I'll be right there.

1622
01:48:36,625 --> 01:48:38,524
Several fighters have broken off...

1623
01:48:38,627 --> 01:48:41,095
from the main group.
Come with me.

1624
01:48:44,065 --> 01:48:46,556
Fall in! Fall in!

1625
01:48:46,667 --> 01:48:47,657
Watch your back, Luke.

1626
01:48:47,769 --> 01:48:48,735
Watch your back.

1627
01:48:48,837 --> 01:48:50,099
Fighters above you, coming in.

1628
01:48:56,444 --> 01:48:57,537
I'm hit, but not bad.

1629
01:48:57,645 --> 01:48:59,045
R2, see what you can do with it.

1630
01:48:59,146 --> 01:49:01,341
Hang on back there.

1631
01:49:01,449 --> 01:49:04,078
Red Six, can you see Red Five?

1632
01:49:04,185 --> 01:49:05,413
There's a heavy fire zone.

1633
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:06,578
Red Five, where are you?

1634
01:49:06,688 --> 01:49:08,121
I can't shake him!

1635
01:49:12,194 --> 01:49:13,661
I'm on him, Luke. Hold on.

1636
01:49:16,931 --> 01:49:18,559
Blast it, Biggs! Where are you?

1637
01:49:25,606 --> 01:49:26,664
Thanks, Wedge.

1638
01:49:26,774 --> 01:49:29,038
Good shooting,
Wedge. Red Leader...

1639
01:49:29,144 --> 01:49:30,337
this is Gold Leader.

1640
01:49:30,444 --> 01:49:31,570
We're starting our attack run.

1641
01:49:33,381 --> 01:49:35,850
I copy, Gold Leader.
Move into position.

1642
01:49:38,185 --> 01:49:40,449
Stay in attack formation.

1643
01:49:40,555 --> 01:49:43,456
The exhaust port
is marked and locked in.

1644
01:49:49,296 --> 01:49:50,524
Switch all power...

1645
01:49:50,631 --> 01:49:53,100
to front deflector screen.

1646
01:49:53,201 --> 01:49:54,690
Switch all power...

1647
01:49:54,802 --> 01:49:56,703
to front deflector screen.

1648
01:50:00,475 --> 01:50:02,203
How many guns do you think,
Gold Five?

1649
01:50:02,310 --> 01:50:03,470
Say about 20 guns...

1650
01:50:03,578 --> 01:50:05,546
some on the surface,
some on the towers.

1651
01:50:05,646 --> 01:50:08,479
<i>Death Star will be in range
in five minutes.</i>

1652
01:50:10,585 --> 01:50:13,610
Switch to targeting computer.

1653
01:50:16,091 --> 01:50:18,115
Computer locked.
Getting a signal.

1654
01:50:20,162 --> 01:50:22,630
The guns!
They've stopped!

1655
01:50:24,332 --> 01:50:25,730
Stabilize your rear deflectors.

1656
01:50:25,833 --> 01:50:27,494
Watch for enemy fighters.

1657
01:50:27,601 --> 01:50:29,399
They're coming in!
Three marks at 210.

1658
01:50:31,405 --> 01:50:33,567
I'll take them myself.
Cover me.

1659
01:50:33,675 --> 01:50:34,971
Yes, sir.

1660
01:50:49,524 --> 01:50:50,582
It's no good.
I can't maneuver.

1661
01:50:50,692 --> 01:50:51,716
Stay on target.

1662
01:50:51,827 --> 01:50:52,793
We're too close.

1663
01:50:52,894 --> 01:50:53,882
Stay on target.

1664
01:50:55,697 --> 01:50:56,663
Loosen up!

1665
01:50:59,734 --> 01:51:02,497
Gold Five to Red Leader,
lost Tiree, lost Hutch.

1666
01:51:02,604 --> 01:51:03,865
I copy, Gold Leader.

1667
01:51:03,971 --> 01:51:04,939
They came from behind.

1668
01:51:09,644 --> 01:51:11,543
We've analyzed their attack, sir...

1669
01:51:11,645 --> 01:51:14,046
and there is a danger.

1670
01:51:14,149 --> 01:51:16,173
Should I have your
ship standing by?

1671
01:51:16,283 --> 01:51:19,082
Evacuate in our moment of triumph?

1672
01:51:19,186 --> 01:51:21,451
I think you overestimate
their chances.

1673
01:51:21,555 --> 01:51:24,184
<i>Rebel base, three minutes
and closing.</i>

1674
01:51:24,292 --> 01:51:26,817
Red boys, this is Red Leader.

1675
01:51:26,927 --> 01:51:28,327
Rendezvous at mark 6.1.

1676
01:51:28,430 --> 01:51:30,625
This is Red Two flying toward you.

1677
01:51:30,731 --> 01:51:32,631
Red Three standing by.

1678
01:51:32,734 --> 01:51:34,292
Red Leader, this is Base One.

1679
01:51:34,402 --> 01:51:35,868
Keep half your group
out of range...

1680
01:51:35,970 --> 01:51:37,029
for the next run.

1681
01:51:37,139 --> 01:51:39,733
Copy, Base One. Luke,
take Red Two and Three.

1682
01:51:39,841 --> 01:51:43,207
Hold up here and wait for
my signal to start your run.

1683
01:51:50,985 --> 01:51:52,817
This is it!

1684
01:51:57,425 --> 01:51:59,484
We should be able to see it by now.

1685
01:52:01,195 --> 01:52:02,958
Keep your eyes open
for those fighters.

1686
01:52:04,666 --> 01:52:05,997
There's too much interference.

1687
01:52:06,100 --> 01:52:07,193
Red Five, can you see them
from where you are?

1688
01:52:07,301 --> 01:52:09,202
No sign of any...
Wait. Coming in.35.

1689
01:52:09,304 --> 01:52:10,270
I see them.

1690
01:52:11,805 --> 01:52:12,898
I'm in range.

1691
01:52:14,176 --> 01:52:15,143
Target's coming up.

1692
01:52:18,479 --> 01:52:20,606
Just hold them off
for a few seconds.

1693
01:52:20,715 --> 01:52:23,012
Close up formation.

1694
01:52:24,386 --> 01:52:26,581
Almost there.

1695
01:52:35,663 --> 01:52:37,597
You'd better let her loose.
They're right behind me.

1696
01:52:37,698 --> 01:52:38,926
Almost there.

1697
01:52:40,335 --> 01:52:41,962
I can't hold them.

1698
01:52:43,238 --> 01:52:44,932
Aah!

1699
01:52:50,212 --> 01:52:51,679
It's away!

1700
01:52:55,516 --> 01:52:57,041
It's a hit!

1701
01:52:57,152 --> 01:52:59,211
Negative, negative.
It didn't go in.

1702
01:52:59,320 --> 01:53:01,948
It just impacted on the surface.

1703
01:53:08,496 --> 01:53:10,087
Red Leader, we're right above you.

1704
01:53:10,198 --> 01:53:12,496
Turn to.05.
We'll cover for you.

1705
01:53:12,600 --> 01:53:16,092
Stay there. I just lost
my starboard engine.

1706
01:53:16,203 --> 01:53:18,467
Get set up for your attack run.

1707
01:53:23,078 --> 01:53:24,704
Aah!

1708
01:53:31,252 --> 01:53:34,346
<i>Rebel base,
one minute and closing.</i>

1709
01:53:34,456 --> 01:53:36,753
Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up.

1710
01:53:36,858 --> 01:53:38,654
We're going in full throttle.

1711
01:53:38,760 --> 01:53:40,158
That ought to keep those
fighters off our back.

1712
01:53:40,261 --> 01:53:42,354
Right with you, boss.

1713
01:53:42,463 --> 01:53:44,761
Luke, at that speed, will you be able
to pull out in time?

1714
01:53:44,865 --> 01:53:46,856
It'll be just like
Beggars Canyon back home.

1715
01:53:54,208 --> 01:53:56,439
We'll stay back
far enough to cover you.

1716
01:53:56,543 --> 01:53:57,601
My scope shows the tower...

1717
01:53:57,712 --> 01:53:59,110
but I can't see the exhaust port.

1718
01:53:59,213 --> 01:54:00,680
Are you sure
the computer can hit it?

1719
01:54:04,118 --> 01:54:06,144
Watch yourself.
Increase speed, full throttle.

1720
01:54:06,253 --> 01:54:07,515
What about that tower?

1721
01:54:07,622 --> 01:54:08,782
You worry about those fighters!

1722
01:54:08,890 --> 01:54:10,050
I'll worry about the tower!

1723
01:54:15,663 --> 01:54:18,655
R2, that stabilizer's
broken loose again.

1724
01:54:18,766 --> 01:54:20,064
See if you can't lock it down.

1725
01:54:28,777 --> 01:54:30,971
Fighters coming in.3.

1726
01:54:39,020 --> 01:54:41,488
I'm hit!
I can't stay with you!

1727
01:54:41,588 --> 01:54:43,921
Get clear, Wedge.
You can't do any more good back there.

1728
01:54:44,024 --> 01:54:44,992
Sorry.

1729
01:54:46,261 --> 01:54:47,989
Let him go.
Stay on the leader.

1730
01:54:50,998 --> 01:54:52,488
Hurry, Luke. They're coming in
much faster this time.

1731
01:54:52,600 --> 01:54:53,760
We can't hold them.

1732
01:54:57,372 --> 01:54:58,737
R2, try and increase the power.

1733
01:55:05,479 --> 01:55:06,673
Hurry up, Luke!

1734
01:55:06,780 --> 01:55:08,270
Quick! Quick!

1735
01:55:15,823 --> 01:55:18,349
<i>Rebel base, 30 seconds and closing.</i>

1736
01:55:18,460 --> 01:55:19,551
I'm on the leader.

1737
01:55:23,030 --> 01:55:24,430
Hang on, R2.

1738
01:55:39,913 --> 01:55:42,279
<i>Use the Force, Luke.</i>

1739
01:55:45,153 --> 01:55:47,747
<i>Let go, Luke.</i>

1740
01:55:49,224 --> 01:55:51,590
The Force is strong with this one.

1741
01:55:51,693 --> 01:55:53,284
<i>Luke, trust me.</i>

1742
01:55:58,832 --> 01:56:00,163
His computer's off.

1743
01:56:00,268 --> 01:56:02,167
Luke, you switched off
your targeting computer!

1744
01:56:02,270 --> 01:56:03,896
What's wrong?

1745
01:56:04,005 --> 01:56:05,631
Nothing. I'm all right.

1746
01:56:18,552 --> 01:56:19,747
I've lost R2!

1747
01:56:21,355 --> 01:56:24,189
<i>The Death Star
has cleared the planet.</i>

1748
01:56:24,292 --> 01:56:27,125
<i>The Death Star
has cleared the planet.</i>

1749
01:56:27,228 --> 01:56:28,854
<i>Rebel base in range.</i>

1750
01:56:28,962 --> 01:56:31,453
You may fire when ready.

1751
01:56:31,565 --> 01:56:33,761
<i>Commence primary ignition.</i>

1752
01:56:46,914 --> 01:56:48,542
I have you now.

1753
01:56:50,885 --> 01:56:51,976
What?

1754
01:56:52,086 --> 01:56:53,052
Yahoo!

1755
01:56:54,889 --> 01:56:56,220
Look out!

1756
01:57:02,329 --> 01:57:05,127
You're all clear, kid!
Now let's blow this thing and go home!

1757
01:57:11,972 --> 01:57:13,405
<i>Stand by.</i>

1758
01:57:16,444 --> 01:57:17,911
<i>Stand by.</i>

1759
01:57:28,523 --> 01:57:29,511
Great shot, kid!

1760
01:57:29,623 --> 01:57:31,716
That was one in a million!

1761
01:57:31,826 --> 01:57:36,319
<i>Remember, the Force
will be with you always.</i>

1762
01:57:54,782 --> 01:57:56,248
Luke!

1763
01:58:00,188 --> 01:58:01,587
Hey! Hey!

1764
01:58:01,689 --> 01:58:03,452
I knew you'd come back.
I just knew it.

1765
01:58:03,557 --> 01:58:04,889
Well, I wasn't going to let you
get all the credit...

1766
01:58:04,993 --> 01:58:06,289
and take all the reward.

1767
01:58:06,394 --> 01:58:08,953
Hey, I knew there was
more to you than money.

1768
01:58:09,063 --> 01:58:10,256
Oh, no!

1769
01:58:10,364 --> 01:58:12,798
Oh, my. R2, can you hear me?

1770
01:58:12,900 --> 01:58:16,301
Say something.
You can repair him, can't you?

1771
01:58:16,404 --> 01:58:18,234
We'll get to work
on him right away.

1772
01:58:18,338 --> 01:58:19,703
You must repair him.

1773
01:58:19,806 --> 01:58:21,536
Sir, if any of my circuits
or gears will help...

1774
01:58:21,643 --> 01:58:22,701
I'll gladly donate them.

1775
01:58:22,810 --> 01:58:23,935
He'll be all right.

1776
01:58:58,412 --> 01:58:59,970
Argh!

1777
02:00:02,476 --> 02:00:05,070
Argh!

1778
02:00:11,853 --> 02:00:14,720
Argh!
