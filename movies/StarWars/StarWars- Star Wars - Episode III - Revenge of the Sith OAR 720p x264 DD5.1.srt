1
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,375
Lock on to him, R2.

2
00:03:06,501 --> 00:03:09,917
Master, General Grievous's
ship is directly ahead-

3
00:03:10,045 --> 00:03:12,252
the one crawling
with vulture droids.

4
00:03:12,382 --> 00:03:14,872
I see it.
Oh, this is going to be easy.

5
00:03:22,557 --> 00:03:25,096
- Oddball, do you copy?
- Copy, Red Leader.

6
00:03:25,228 --> 00:03:27,468
Mark my position.
Form your squad up behind me.

7
00:03:27,604 --> 00:03:29,478
We're on your tail,
General Kenobi.

8
00:03:29,606 --> 00:03:31,515
Set S-foils in attack position.

9
00:03:45,454 --> 00:03:47,448
This is where the fun begins.

10
00:03:47,581 --> 00:03:49,574
Let them pass between us.

11
00:04:06,349 --> 00:04:08,473
They're all over me.

12
00:04:08,602 --> 00:04:11,603
- Get them off my-
- I'm gonna go help them out.

13
00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:15,098
No. They are doing theirjob
so we can do ours.

14
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:30,988
Missiles. Pull up.

15
00:04:33,084 --> 00:04:35,620
- They overshot us.
- They're coming around.

16
00:04:41,675 --> 00:04:45,459
All right, R4. No, no.
Nothing too fancy.

17
00:04:48,723 --> 00:04:51,807
Surge all power units, R2.
Stand by reverse thrusters.

18
00:05:00,942 --> 00:05:02,651
We got 'em, R2.

19
00:05:12,161 --> 00:05:14,154
Flying is for droids.

20
00:05:21,379 --> 00:05:23,917
- I'm hit. Anakin?
- I see them.

21
00:05:24,048 --> 00:05:25,163
Buzz droids.

22
00:05:33,014 --> 00:05:34,807
R4, be careful. You have a-

23
00:05:38,521 --> 00:05:39,848
Oh, dear.

24
00:05:42,024 --> 00:05:43,814
They're shutting down
all the controls.

25
00:05:43,942 --> 00:05:46,064
Move to the right so I can
get a clear shot at them.

26
00:05:46,194 --> 00:05:48,353
The mission.
Get to the command ship.

27
00:05:48,487 --> 00:05:50,896
Get the chancellor.
I'm running out of tricks here.

28
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,077
In the name of-

29
00:06:00,415 --> 00:06:04,365
- Hold your fire! You're not helping.
- I agree. Bad idea.

30
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,552
I can't see a thing.
My cockpit's fogging.

31
00:06:16,848 --> 00:06:18,721
They're all over me. Anakin!

32
00:06:22,437 --> 00:06:25,437
- Move to the right.
- Hold on. You'll get us both killed.

33
00:06:27,817 --> 00:06:29,893
Get out of here.
There's nothing more you can do.

34
00:06:30,028 --> 00:06:32,185
I'm not leaving
without you, Master.

35
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:44,034
Get him, R2.

36
00:06:46,084 --> 00:06:47,459
Watch out.

37
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:54,415
R2, hit the buzz droid's centre eye.

38
00:07:01,641 --> 00:07:03,930
- Yeah, you got him!
- Great, R2.

39
00:07:06,269 --> 00:07:08,144
The general's command ship
is dead ahead.

40
00:07:10,274 --> 00:07:12,314
Have you noticed
the shields are still up?

41
00:07:12,442 --> 00:07:13,817
Sorry, Master.

42
00:07:21,994 --> 00:07:24,069
I have a bad feeling about this.

43
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:40,800
There they are. Get them.

44
00:07:52,146 --> 00:07:54,603
R2, locate the chancellor.

45
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:05,660
The chancellor's signal
is coming from right there-

46
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:08,821
the observation platform
at the top of that spire.

47
00:08:08,954 --> 00:08:10,863
I sense Count Dooku.

48
00:08:10,997 --> 00:08:13,620
- I sense a trap.
- Next move?

49
00:08:14,377 --> 00:08:16,286
Spring the trap.

50
00:08:18,923 --> 00:08:21,211
R2, go back.
I need you to stay with the ship.

51
00:08:21,341 --> 00:08:23,214
Here. Take this
and wait for orders.

52
00:08:37,565 --> 00:08:41,015
What's the situation, Captain?

53
00:08:41,152 --> 00:08:45,066
Two Jedi have landed in the main
hangar bay. We're tracking them.

54
00:08:45,197 --> 00:08:48,482
Just as Count Dooku predicted.

55
00:08:53,581 --> 00:08:54,695
Destroyers.

56
00:09:02,923 --> 00:09:05,758
Drop your weapons.
I said drop 'em.

57
00:09:05,884 --> 00:09:07,756
- Roger.
- Roger, roger.

58
00:09:16,309 --> 00:09:18,219
Those are Jedi fighters all right.

59
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:25,808
- Did you press the stop button?
- No. Did you?

60
00:09:25,945 --> 00:09:28,232
There's more than
one way out of here.

61
00:09:28,989 --> 00:09:31,195
We don't want to get out.
We want to get moving.

62
00:09:31,325 --> 00:09:35,155
R2, activate elevator 31174.

63
00:09:36,038 --> 00:09:38,196
- Come in, R2.
- What that?

64
00:09:38,331 --> 00:09:40,205
R2, do you copy?

65
00:09:40,332 --> 00:09:43,749
R2, activate
the elevator number 31174.

66
00:09:44,671 --> 00:09:47,587
Get back to work. That nothin'.

67
00:09:47,715 --> 00:09:50,631
Activate the elevator 31174.

68
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:52,217
R2-

69
00:09:58,475 --> 00:10:00,349
Always on the move.

70
00:10:00,476 --> 00:10:03,431
R2, switch on the comlink.
R2, can you hear me?

71
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:06,148
R2?

72
00:10:08,527 --> 00:10:10,104
R2! R2!

73
00:10:14,783 --> 00:10:17,451
Stop. Stop.
R2, we need to be going up.

74
00:10:19,912 --> 00:10:21,786
Hands up,Jedi.

75
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:24,072
R2, do you copy?

76
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:28,158
R2, do you hear me?
R2, we need to be going up, not down.

77
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,294
Hey, you!

78
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,134
That's better.

79
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,806
You stupid little astro droid.

80
00:10:56,154 --> 00:10:57,614
Oh, it's you.

81
00:10:59,741 --> 00:11:01,533
My eyes! My eyes!

82
00:11:01,659 --> 00:11:04,994
- What was that all about?
- R2 has been-

83
00:11:05,121 --> 00:11:07,114
- No loose wire jokes.
- Did I say anything?

84
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:09,158
- He's trying.
- I didn't say anything.

85
00:11:46,827 --> 00:11:48,701
- Chancellor.
- Are you all right?

86
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,288
Count Dooku.

87
00:11:55,043 --> 00:11:58,875
- This time we will do it together.
- I was about to say that.

88
00:12:07,847 --> 00:12:11,051
Get help. You're no match for him.
He's a Sith lord.

89
00:12:11,851 --> 00:12:15,221
Chancellor Palpatine,
Sith lords are our speciality.

90
00:12:16,313 --> 00:12:18,187
Your swords, please.

91
00:12:18,316 --> 00:12:21,768
We don't want to make a mess of things
in front of the chancellor.

92
00:12:21,903 --> 00:12:24,109
You won't get away
this time, Dooku.

93
00:12:34,956 --> 00:12:37,033
I've been looking forward to this.

94
00:12:37,168 --> 00:12:40,334
My powers have doubled since
the last time we met, Count.

95
00:12:40,461 --> 00:12:43,913
Good. Twice the pride,
double the fall.

96
00:13:04,025 --> 00:13:04,975
Get-

97
00:13:30,259 --> 00:13:34,303
I sense great fear in you, Skywalker.

98
00:13:35,431 --> 00:13:38,384
You have hate.
You have anger.

99
00:13:39,184 --> 00:13:41,094
But you don't use them.

100
00:14:00,746 --> 00:14:03,153
Good, Anakin. Good.

101
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:06,620
Kill him.

102
00:14:08,129 --> 00:14:09,671
Kill him now.

103
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,220
I shouldn't.

104
00:14:20,097 --> 00:14:21,177
Do it.

105
00:14:33,235 --> 00:14:36,153
You did well, Anakin.

106
00:14:36,905 --> 00:14:39,443
He was too dangerous
to be kept alive.

107
00:14:40,283 --> 00:14:42,655
Yes, but he was
an unarmed prisoner.

108
00:14:42,787 --> 00:14:45,657
I shouldn't have done that.
It's not the Jedi way.

109
00:14:46,499 --> 00:14:50,875
It is only natural. He cut off your arm,
and you wanted revenge.

110
00:14:51,003 --> 00:14:53,125
It wasn't the first time, Anakin.

111
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:57,879
Remember what you told me about
your mother and the Sand People?

112
00:15:00,678 --> 00:15:04,260
Now we must leave before
more security droids arrive.

113
00:15:09,102 --> 00:15:11,640
Anakin, there's no time.

114
00:15:11,773 --> 00:15:14,097
We must get off this ship
before it's too late.

115
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:19,110
- He seems to be all right.
- Leave him, or we'll never make it.

116
00:15:19,238 --> 00:15:21,277
His fate will be the same as ours.

117
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:28,528
Prepare for attack!

118
00:15:30,831 --> 00:15:32,740
All batteries, fire! Fire!

119
00:15:42,802 --> 00:15:44,711
Elevator's not working.

120
00:15:48,474 --> 00:15:51,095
R2, activate elevator 3224.

121
00:16:09,826 --> 00:16:13,076
- Reverse stabilizers.
- Reversing stabilizers.

122
00:16:32,349 --> 00:16:34,471
Magnetize! Magnetize!

123
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:44,350
Fire the emergency booster engines.

124
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:51,279
We're levelling out, sir.

125
00:17:07,048 --> 00:17:09,207
Easy. We're in a bit
of a situation here.

126
00:17:09,342 --> 00:17:11,915
- Did I miss something?
- Hold on.

127
00:17:12,053 --> 00:17:14,211
- What is that?
- Oops.

128
00:17:14,346 --> 00:17:16,304
R2. R2, shut down the elevator.

129
00:17:16,432 --> 00:17:17,630
Too late. Jump!

130
00:17:31,989 --> 00:17:35,606
Let's see if we can find something
in the hangar bay that's still flyable.

131
00:17:35,741 --> 00:17:37,817
R2, get down here.

132
00:17:38,577 --> 00:17:40,202
R2, do you copy?

133
00:17:45,876 --> 00:17:48,913
General, we found the Jedi.
They're in hallway 328.

134
00:17:49,047 --> 00:17:51,372
Activate ray shields.

135
00:17:54,343 --> 00:17:55,624
Ray shields.

136
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,632
Wait a minute. How did this happen?
We're smarter than this.

137
00:17:58,763 --> 00:18:00,092
Apparently not.

138
00:18:02,101 --> 00:18:05,267
- I say patience.
- Patience?

139
00:18:06,145 --> 00:18:08,636
Yes. R2 will be along
in a few moments...

140
00:18:08,773 --> 00:18:11,478
and then he'll release
the ray shields.

141
00:18:18,657 --> 00:18:20,900
See? No problem.

142
00:18:23,246 --> 00:18:24,823
Don't move.

143
00:18:28,209 --> 00:18:30,082
Do you have a plan B?

144
00:18:36,758 --> 00:18:39,084
Ah, yes.

145
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:41,295
The negotiator.

146
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:45,641
General Kenobi.
We've been waiting for you.

147
00:18:45,767 --> 00:18:46,930
Excuse me.

148
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:50,759
- That wasn't much of a rescue.
- You're welcome.

149
00:18:51,564 --> 00:18:53,022
And-

150
00:18:53,775 --> 00:18:56,182
Anakin Skywalker.

151
00:18:56,318 --> 00:19:02,023
I was expecting someone with
your reputation to be a little... older.

152
00:19:04,535 --> 00:19:08,449
General Grievous.
You're shorter than I expected.

153
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:12,367
Jedi scum.

154
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,951
We have a job to do, Anakin.
Try not to upset him.

155
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:25,382
Your lightsabres will make
a fine addition to my collection.

156
00:19:25,512 --> 00:19:29,178
Not this time.
And this time, you won't escape.

157
00:19:29,307 --> 00:19:30,304
R2.

158
00:19:35,314 --> 00:19:36,689
Crush them!

159
00:19:38,107 --> 00:19:40,147
Make them suffer!

160
00:19:44,197 --> 00:19:45,856
Come. Now!

161
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:48,148
Stay at your stations!

162
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:56,705
Get him! Get him!

163
00:20:16,478 --> 00:20:17,557
Run!

164
00:20:21,148 --> 00:20:23,022
Don't bother with them.

165
00:20:23,151 --> 00:20:25,440
- Keep the ship in orbit.
- Yes, sir.

166
00:20:35,704 --> 00:20:38,374
You lose, General Kenobi.

167
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:04,269
Get out of here! Run!

168
00:21:17,452 --> 00:21:19,907
Time to abandon ship.

169
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:29,541
All the escape pods
have been launched.

170
00:21:29,672 --> 00:21:32,709
Grievous.
Can you fly a cruiser like this?

171
00:21:32,842 --> 00:21:35,547
- You mean, can I land what's left of it?
- Well?

172
00:21:35,677 --> 00:21:39,509
Under the circumstances, I'd say the
ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant.

173
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,802
Strap yourselves in.

174
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:45,435
Open all hatches.
Extend all flaps and drag fins.

175
00:22:02,453 --> 00:22:04,326
We lost something.

176
00:22:04,454 --> 00:22:06,911
Not to worry.
We are still flying half a ship.

177
00:22:12,587 --> 00:22:14,165
Now we're really picking up speed.

178
00:22:22,847 --> 00:22:24,638
Eight plus 60.

179
00:22:25,558 --> 00:22:28,049
- We're in the atmosphere.
- Grab that. Keep us level.

180
00:22:41,949 --> 00:22:43,608
Steady.

181
00:22:46,453 --> 00:22:47,781
Easy, R2.

182
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,624
5000.

183
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,660
Fire ships on the left and the right.

184
00:22:54,795 --> 00:22:57,499
- We'll take you in.
- Copy that.

185
00:22:59,924 --> 00:23:03,673
- Landing strip, straight ahead.
- We're coming in too hot.

186
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:37,124
Another happy landing.

187
00:24:06,988 --> 00:24:08,398
Coming, Master?

188
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:12,948
No. I'm not brave enough for politics.
I have to report to the council.

189
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:15,484
Besides, someone needs
to be the poster boy.

190
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:19,452
Hold on.
This whole operation was your idea.

191
00:24:19,584 --> 00:24:22,702
Let us not forget, Anakin, that
you rescued me from the buzz droids.

192
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:25,209
And you killed Count Dooku,
and you rescued the chancellor...

193
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:27,248
carrying me unconscious
on your back.

194
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,835
All because of your training.

195
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:33,468
Anakin, let's be fair.
Today you were the hero...

196
00:24:33,596 --> 00:24:36,965
and you deserve your glorious day
with the politicians.

197
00:24:37,099 --> 00:24:40,800
All right. But you owe me one, and not
for saving your skin for the 1 Oth time.

198
00:24:40,936 --> 00:24:42,218
Ninth time.

199
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:47,150
That business on Cato Neimoidia doesn't
count. I'll see you at the briefing.

200
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:55,021
Chancellor Palpatine,
are you all right?

201
00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:58,028
Yes. Thanks to your two Jedi knights.

202
00:24:58,162 --> 00:25:02,824
They killed Count Dooku, but
General Grievous has escaped once again.

203
00:25:02,958 --> 00:25:06,457
General Grievous will run and hide,
as he always does. He's a coward.

204
00:25:06,586 --> 00:25:10,880
But with Count Dooku dead,
he is the leader of the droid army.

205
00:25:11,007 --> 00:25:12,881
And I assure you...

206
00:25:13,009 --> 00:25:16,710
the senate will vote to continue the war
as long as Grievous is alive.

207
00:25:16,846 --> 00:25:20,891
Then the Jedi Council will make
finding Grievous our highest priority.

208
00:25:22,393 --> 00:25:24,267
- Watch it.
- Excuse me.

209
00:25:24,394 --> 00:25:27,348
- Come along, R2.
- The Republic cannot praise you enough.

210
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,604
Thank you, Senator Organa.

211
00:25:30,651 --> 00:25:33,271
It couldn't possibly
be as bad as all that.

212
00:25:34,028 --> 00:25:35,903
Now there I agree with you.

213
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:38,736
In fact, I could do with
a tune-up myself.

214
00:25:38,866 --> 00:25:43,077
But the fighting will continue until
General Grievous is spare parts.

215
00:25:44,122 --> 00:25:46,613
I will do everything
I can in the senate.

216
00:25:47,541 --> 00:25:49,451
- Excuse me.
- Certainly.

217
00:26:04,391 --> 00:26:06,265
I've missed you, Padmé.

218
00:26:07,478 --> 00:26:10,681
There were whispers
that you'd been killed.

219
00:26:10,814 --> 00:26:12,688
I'm all right.

220
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,438
It feels like we've been
apart for a lifetime.

221
00:26:16,568 --> 00:26:19,356
And it might have been,
if the chancellor hadn't been kidnapped.

222
00:26:19,489 --> 00:26:22,821
I don't think they would have ever brought
us back from the outer rim sieges.

223
00:26:22,951 --> 00:26:25,571
- Wait. Not here.
- Yes, here.

224
00:26:25,702 --> 00:26:29,153
I'm tired of all this deception.
I don't care if they know we're married.

225
00:26:29,289 --> 00:26:31,531
Anakin, don't say things like that.

226
00:26:40,384 --> 00:26:43,965
Are you all right?
You're trembling.

227
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:46,218
What's going on?

228
00:26:48,307 --> 00:26:50,465
Something wonderful has happened.

229
00:26:52,394 --> 00:26:55,729
Ani, I'm pregnant.

230
00:27:07,617 --> 00:27:09,194
That's wonderful.

231
00:27:11,954 --> 00:27:14,077
What are we gonna do?

232
00:27:15,375 --> 00:27:18,958
We're not gonna worry about
anything right now. All right?

233
00:27:19,753 --> 00:27:21,546
This is a happy moment.

234
00:27:23,549 --> 00:27:25,837
The happiest moment of my life.

235
00:28:31,698 --> 00:28:34,817
Yes, Lord Sidious?

236
00:28:34,951 --> 00:28:36,824
General Grievous...

237
00:28:36,952 --> 00:28:42,028
I suggest you move
the separatist leaders to Mustafar.

238
00:28:42,165 --> 00:28:45,201
It will be done, my lord.

239
00:28:46,127 --> 00:28:50,375
The end of the war is near, General.

240
00:28:51,173 --> 00:28:54,092
But the loss of Count Dooku-

241
00:28:54,219 --> 00:28:58,346
His death was a necessary loss.

242
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:02,758
Soon I will have a new apprentice-

243
00:29:02,894 --> 00:29:08,135
one far younger
and more powerful.

244
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:38,174
Ani, I want to have our baby
back home on Naboo.

245
00:29:38,301 --> 00:29:41,635
We can go to the lake country
where no one will know...

246
00:29:41,763 --> 00:29:43,637
where we can be safe.

247
00:29:44,892 --> 00:29:47,181
I can go early
and fix up the baby's room.

248
00:29:51,065 --> 00:29:55,192
I know the perfect spot.
Right by the gardens.

249
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:03,067
You are so... beautiful.

250
00:30:04,701 --> 00:30:06,741
It's only because I'm so in love.

251
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:11,496
No, it's because
I'm so in love with you.

252
00:30:13,586 --> 00:30:15,542
So love has blinded you?

253
00:30:18,007 --> 00:30:20,046
That's not exactly what I meant.

254
00:30:21,634 --> 00:30:23,674
But it's probably true.

255
00:30:33,313 --> 00:30:35,388
Anakin, help me!

256
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,950
What's bothering you?

257
00:31:43,046 --> 00:31:44,374
Nothing.

258
00:31:46,632 --> 00:31:48,672
I remember when
I gave this to you.

259
00:31:49,594 --> 00:31:52,961
How long is it gonna take for us
to be honest with each other?

260
00:31:56,057 --> 00:31:59,011
- It was a dream.
- Bad?

261
00:31:59,811 --> 00:32:04,223
Like the ones I used to have about
my mother, just before she died.

262
00:32:04,357 --> 00:32:05,637
And?

263
00:32:09,112 --> 00:32:11,020
And it was about you.

264
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,897
Tell me.

265
00:32:17,327 --> 00:32:19,201
It was only a dream.

266
00:32:32,175 --> 00:32:34,085
You die in childbirth.

267
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:37,009
And the baby?

268
00:32:37,763 --> 00:32:39,423
I don't know.

269
00:32:41,601 --> 00:32:45,135
- It was only a dream.
- I won't let this one become real.

270
00:32:46,855 --> 00:32:48,895
This baby will change our lives.

271
00:32:49,858 --> 00:32:52,813
I doubt the queen will continue
to allow me to serve in the senate.

272
00:32:52,944 --> 00:32:55,317
If the council discovers
you're the father, you'll be expelled-

273
00:32:55,448 --> 00:32:57,356
I know. I know.

274
00:32:58,742 --> 00:33:01,742
Do you think Obi-Wan
might be able to help us?

275
00:33:03,788 --> 00:33:05,780
We don't need his help.

276
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:10,122
Our baby is a blessing.

277
00:33:26,352 --> 00:33:27,810
Premonitions?

278
00:33:27,936 --> 00:33:29,395
Premonitions.

279
00:33:30,605 --> 00:33:32,729
These visions you have-

280
00:33:34,526 --> 00:33:37,443
They're of pain, suffering.

281
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,281
Death.

282
00:33:41,407 --> 00:33:45,785
Yourself you speak of,
or someone you know?

283
00:33:47,747 --> 00:33:49,288
Someone.

284
00:33:49,415 --> 00:33:51,288
Close to you?

285
00:33:52,501 --> 00:33:53,960
Yes.

286
00:33:54,836 --> 00:33:58,669
Careful you must be when
sensing the future, Anakin.

287
00:33:58,798 --> 00:34:03,093
The fear of loss is a path
to the dark side.

288
00:34:05,346 --> 00:34:07,837
I won't let these visions
come true, Master Yoda.

289
00:34:08,726 --> 00:34:11,891
Death is a natural part of life.

290
00:34:12,019 --> 00:34:16,681
Rejoice for those around you
who transform into the Force.

291
00:34:16,817 --> 00:34:20,065
Mourn them, do not.
Miss them, do not.

292
00:34:20,195 --> 00:34:23,278
Attachment leads to jealousy.

293
00:34:23,405 --> 00:34:26,822
The shadow of greed that is.

294
00:34:26,951 --> 00:34:29,157
What must I do, Master Yoda?

295
00:34:29,871 --> 00:34:32,907
Train yourself to let go...

296
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:36,456
of everything you fear to lose.

297
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:49,715
You've missed the report
on the outer rim sieges.

298
00:34:51,056 --> 00:34:53,429
I'm sorry. I was held up.

299
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:57,427
- I have no excuse.
- In short, they are going very well.

300
00:34:57,563 --> 00:35:02,724
Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos
has moved his troops to Boz Pity.

301
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,733
What's wrong, then?

302
00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:11,030
The senate is expected to vote more
executive powers to the chancellor today.

303
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:15,489
That can only mean less deliberating
and more action. Is that bad?

304
00:35:15,621 --> 00:35:18,030
It'll make it easier
for us to end this war.

305
00:35:19,793 --> 00:35:22,081
Be careful of
your friend Palpatine.

306
00:35:23,755 --> 00:35:25,628
Be careful of what?

307
00:35:25,757 --> 00:35:28,378
- He has requested your presence.
- What for?

308
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:30,668
He would not say.

309
00:35:30,802 --> 00:35:34,338
He didn't inform the council?
That's unusual, isn't it?

310
00:35:34,474 --> 00:35:36,679
All of this is unusual.

311
00:35:36,809 --> 00:35:39,134
And it's making me feel uneasy.

312
00:35:54,242 --> 00:35:56,115
I hope you trust me, Anakin.

313
00:35:57,161 --> 00:35:58,360
Of course.

314
00:35:59,539 --> 00:36:01,413
I need your help, son.

315
00:36:02,583 --> 00:36:04,576
What do you mean?

316
00:36:05,378 --> 00:36:07,251
I'm depending on you.

317
00:36:07,963 --> 00:36:09,873
For what? I don't understand.

318
00:36:10,007 --> 00:36:15,594
To be the eyes, ears
and voice of the Republic.

319
00:36:17,931 --> 00:36:22,059
I'm appointing you to be my personal
representative on the Jedi Council.

320
00:36:22,184 --> 00:36:23,514
Me?

321
00:36:24,228 --> 00:36:25,688
A master?

322
00:36:27,065 --> 00:36:28,938
I'm overwhelmed, sir.

323
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:33,943
But the council elects its own members.
They'll never accept this.

324
00:36:34,072 --> 00:36:37,570
I think they will.
They need you.

325
00:36:38,492 --> 00:36:40,365
More than you know.

326
00:36:50,795 --> 00:36:55,541
Allow this appointment lightly
the council does not.

327
00:36:55,675 --> 00:36:59,090
Disturbing is this move
by Chancellor Palpatine.

328
00:37:00,304 --> 00:37:01,847
I understand.

329
00:37:01,972 --> 00:37:04,297
You are on this council...

330
00:37:04,434 --> 00:37:07,007
but we do not grant you
the rank of master.

331
00:37:08,103 --> 00:37:09,135
What?

332
00:37:14,735 --> 00:37:17,606
How can you do this?
This is outrageous.

333
00:37:17,737 --> 00:37:19,280
It's unfair.

334
00:37:21,282 --> 00:37:24,485
How can you be on the council
and not be a master?

335
00:37:25,286 --> 00:37:28,121
Take a seat, young Skywalker.

336
00:37:31,208 --> 00:37:32,833
Forgive me, Master.

337
00:37:37,047 --> 00:37:39,456
We have surveyed
all systems in the Republic...

338
00:37:39,592 --> 00:37:43,293
but have found no sign
of General Grievous.

339
00:37:43,429 --> 00:37:46,181
Hiding in the outer rim Grievous is.

340
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:49,391
The outlying systems you must sweep.

341
00:37:49,518 --> 00:37:51,724
We do not have
many ships to spare.

342
00:37:51,853 --> 00:37:54,012
What about the droid attack
on the Wookiees?

343
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:57,811
It is critical we send
an attack group there immediately.

344
00:37:57,943 --> 00:38:01,358
He's right. It's a system
we cannot afford to lose.

345
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:04,773
Go I will.

346
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:07,909
Good relations
with the Wookiees I have.

347
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:09,612
It's settled then.

348
00:38:09,746 --> 00:38:14,739
Yoda will take a battalion of clones
to reinforce the Wookiees on Kashyyyk.

349
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:16,914
May the Force be with us all.

350
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:21,793
What kind of nonsense is this?

351
00:38:21,923 --> 00:38:24,295
Put me on the council
and not make me a master?

352
00:38:24,425 --> 00:38:27,177
It's never been done in the history
of the Jedi. It's insulting.

353
00:38:27,304 --> 00:38:30,139
Calm down, Anakin.
You have been given a great honour.

354
00:38:30,264 --> 00:38:33,219
To be on the council at your age-
it's never happened before.

355
00:38:34,393 --> 00:38:37,762
The fact of the matter is
you are too close to the chancellor.

356
00:38:37,896 --> 00:38:41,646
The council doesn't like it
when he interferes in Jedi affairs.

357
00:38:41,775 --> 00:38:45,144
I swear to you,
I didn't ask to be put on the council.

358
00:38:45,278 --> 00:38:47,485
But it's what you wanted.

359
00:38:47,614 --> 00:38:50,900
Your friendship with Chancellor
Palpatine seems to have paid off.

360
00:38:51,034 --> 00:38:52,909
That has nothing to do with this.

361
00:38:53,036 --> 00:38:55,954
The only reason the council
has approved your appointment...

362
00:38:56,081 --> 00:38:58,405
is because
the chancellor trusts you.

363
00:38:59,168 --> 00:39:00,413
And?

364
00:39:01,128 --> 00:39:04,293
Anakin, I am on your side. I didn't
want to put you in this situation.

365
00:39:04,422 --> 00:39:05,585
What situation?

366
00:39:09,677 --> 00:39:14,007
The council wants you to report on
all the chancellor's dealings.

367
00:39:14,139 --> 00:39:16,465
They want to know what he's up to.

368
00:39:21,021 --> 00:39:23,014
They want me to spy
on the chancellor?

369
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:26,610
- But that's treason.
- We are at war, Anakin.

370
00:39:28,653 --> 00:39:31,570
Why didn't the council give me
this assignment when we were in session?

371
00:39:31,697 --> 00:39:34,106
This assignment
is not to be on record.

372
00:39:35,242 --> 00:39:38,161
The chancellor
is not a bad man, Obi-Wan.

373
00:39:38,288 --> 00:39:41,289
He befriended me. He's watched out
for me ever since I arrived here.

374
00:39:41,416 --> 00:39:43,492
That is why you must help us.

375
00:39:43,626 --> 00:39:47,077
Anakin, our allegiance
is to the senate, not to its leader...

376
00:39:47,213 --> 00:39:50,878
who has managed to stay in office
long after his term has expired.

377
00:39:51,007 --> 00:39:52,965
The senate demanded
that he stay longer.

378
00:39:53,094 --> 00:39:56,260
Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin.
Something is out of place.

379
00:39:57,639 --> 00:40:00,556
You're asking me to do something
against the Jedi code.

380
00:40:01,518 --> 00:40:04,554
Against the Republic.
Against a mentor and a friend.

381
00:40:04,688 --> 00:40:08,637
That's what's out of place here.
Why are you asking this of me?

382
00:40:10,985 --> 00:40:12,858
The council is asking you.

383
00:40:19,827 --> 00:40:23,777
Anakin did not take to his
new assignment with much enthusiasm.

384
00:40:24,706 --> 00:40:27,873
It's very dangerous,
putting them together.

385
00:40:28,001 --> 00:40:30,289
I don't think the boy can handle it.

386
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:32,329
I don't trust him.

387
00:40:33,047 --> 00:40:36,251
With all due respect, Master,
is he not the chosen one?

388
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:40,675
Is he not to destroy the Sith
and bring balance to the Force?

389
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:43,630
So the prophecy says.

390
00:40:43,766 --> 00:40:48,641
A prophecy that misread
could have been.

391
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:52,355
He will not let me down.

392
00:40:52,483 --> 00:40:54,391
He never has.

393
00:40:54,527 --> 00:40:57,527
I hope right you are.

394
00:41:22,594 --> 00:41:25,429
Sometimes I wonder what's
happening to the Jedi order.

395
00:41:26,349 --> 00:41:29,385
I think this war is destroying
the principles of the Republic.

396
00:41:31,269 --> 00:41:34,436
Have you ever considered
that we may be on the wrong side?

397
00:41:34,565 --> 00:41:36,438
What do you mean?

398
00:41:38,152 --> 00:41:41,733
What if the democracy we thought
we were serving no longer exists...

399
00:41:41,864 --> 00:41:45,445
and the Republic has become the very
evil we've been fighting to destroy?

400
00:41:46,284 --> 00:41:49,784
I don't believe that.
And you're sounding like a separatist.

401
00:41:51,789 --> 00:41:54,706
This war represents a failure to listen.

402
00:41:54,833 --> 00:41:56,827
Now you're closer
to the chancellor than anyone.

403
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,210
Please, ask him to stop the fighting
and let diplomacy resume.

404
00:42:00,338 --> 00:42:02,876
Don't ask me to do that.

405
00:42:04,467 --> 00:42:08,085
Make a motion in the senate,
where that kind of a request belongs.

406
00:42:08,972 --> 00:42:11,012
- What is it?
- Nothing.

407
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:16,182
Don't do this. Don't shut me out.
Let me help you.

408
00:42:18,981 --> 00:42:20,440
Hold me.

409
00:42:20,567 --> 00:42:22,809
Like you did by the lake on Naboo.

410
00:42:23,987 --> 00:42:26,655
So long ago, when there was
nothing but our love.

411
00:42:27,864 --> 00:42:31,280
No politics, no plotting, no war.

412
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:13,199
- You wanted to see me, Chancellor.
- Yes, Anakin.

413
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:15,282
Come closer. I have good news.

414
00:43:16,994 --> 00:43:18,869
Our clone intelligence units...

415
00:43:18,996 --> 00:43:22,034
have discovered
the location of General Grievous.

416
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:24,739
He's hiding in the Utapau system.

417
00:43:24,878 --> 00:43:26,039
At last.

418
00:43:27,463 --> 00:43:30,630
We'll be able to capture
that monster and end this war.

419
00:43:30,757 --> 00:43:34,092
I would worry about
the collective wisdom of the council...

420
00:43:34,219 --> 00:43:36,592
if it didn't select you
for this assignment.

421
00:43:36,722 --> 00:43:40,056
You're the best choice, by far.

422
00:43:43,103 --> 00:43:44,561
Sit down.

423
00:43:44,688 --> 00:43:45,885
Leave us.

424
00:44:00,452 --> 00:44:04,914
You know I'm not able
to rely on the Jedi Council.

425
00:44:06,708 --> 00:44:10,043
If they haven't included you
in their plot, they soon will.

426
00:44:11,005 --> 00:44:13,081
I'm not sure I understand.

427
00:44:13,215 --> 00:44:16,880
You must sense
what I have come to suspect.

428
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:20,378
The Jedi Council want
control of the Republic.

429
00:44:21,764 --> 00:44:23,673
They're planning to betray me.

430
00:44:24,393 --> 00:44:26,764
- I don't think that-
- Anakin.

431
00:44:27,978 --> 00:44:29,887
Search your feelings.

432
00:44:32,108 --> 00:44:34,646
You know, don't you?

433
00:44:39,072 --> 00:44:40,947
I know they don't trust you.

434
00:44:41,074 --> 00:44:44,360
Or the senate.
Or the Republic.

435
00:44:44,494 --> 00:44:47,068
Or democracy, for that matter.

436
00:44:47,873 --> 00:44:52,202
I have to admit,
my trust in them has been shaken.

437
00:44:52,335 --> 00:44:53,793
Why?

438
00:44:56,005 --> 00:45:00,253
They asked you to do something that
made you feel dishonest, didn't they?

439
00:45:03,304 --> 00:45:06,139
They asked you to spy on me,
didn't they?

440
00:45:13,313 --> 00:45:15,188
I don't know what to say.

441
00:45:15,315 --> 00:45:18,766
Remember back
to your early teachings.

442
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:23,269
All who gain power
are afraid to lose it.

443
00:45:23,407 --> 00:45:28,032
- Even the Jedi.
- The Jedi use their power for good.

444
00:45:28,161 --> 00:45:30,284
Good is a point of view, Anakin.

445
00:45:30,414 --> 00:45:35,574
The Sith and the Jedi
are similar in almost every way...

446
00:45:37,628 --> 00:45:40,380
including their quest
for greater power.

447
00:45:41,923 --> 00:45:44,925
The Sith rely on their passion
for their strength.

448
00:45:45,052 --> 00:45:47,804
They think inwards-
only about themselves.

449
00:45:49,014 --> 00:45:51,255
And the Jedi don't?

450
00:45:52,143 --> 00:45:55,925
The Jedi are selfless.
They only care about others.

451
00:46:06,114 --> 00:46:11,072
Did you ever hear the tragedy
of Darth Plagueis the Wise?

452
00:46:16,206 --> 00:46:20,251
I thought not. It's not a story
the Jedi would tell you.

453
00:46:21,711 --> 00:46:23,668
It's a Sith legend.

454
00:46:24,632 --> 00:46:28,795
Darth Plagueis was
a dark lord of the Sith...

455
00:46:28,927 --> 00:46:31,797
so powerful and so wise...

456
00:46:31,929 --> 00:46:36,757
he could use the Force to
influence the midi-chlorians...

457
00:46:36,893 --> 00:46:40,059
to create... life.

458
00:46:41,731 --> 00:46:44,766
He had such a knowledge
of the dark side...

459
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:49,360
he could even keep
the ones he cared about...

460
00:46:50,489 --> 00:46:51,947
from dying.

461
00:46:56,244 --> 00:47:00,028
He could actually...
save people from death?

462
00:47:00,916 --> 00:47:05,411
The dark side of the Force is
a pathway to many abilities...

463
00:47:05,545 --> 00:47:09,757
some consider to be unnatural.

464
00:47:10,842 --> 00:47:12,715
What happened to him?

465
00:47:13,762 --> 00:47:15,884
He became so powerful...

466
00:47:17,181 --> 00:47:19,257
the only thing he was afraid of was...

467
00:47:20,476 --> 00:47:22,349
losing his power.

468
00:47:22,478 --> 00:47:24,601
Which eventually, of course, he did.

469
00:47:25,815 --> 00:47:30,974
Unfortunately, he taught
his apprentice everything he knew.

470
00:47:31,778 --> 00:47:34,400
Then his apprentice
killed him in his sleep.

471
00:47:37,617 --> 00:47:39,360
It's ironic.

472
00:47:39,494 --> 00:47:41,617
He could save others from death...

473
00:47:42,746 --> 00:47:44,822
but not himself.

474
00:47:49,003 --> 00:47:51,541
Is it possible to learn this power?

475
00:47:55,384 --> 00:47:57,507
Not from a Jedi.

476
00:48:14,402 --> 00:48:16,275
All Red units, over here!

477
00:48:28,081 --> 00:48:30,454
Palpatine thinks General Grievous
is on Utapau?

478
00:48:31,293 --> 00:48:33,166
A partial message was intercepted...

479
00:48:33,295 --> 00:48:35,751
in a diplomatic packet
from the chairman of Utapau.

480
00:48:38,342 --> 00:48:40,418
Act on this we must.

481
00:48:41,677 --> 00:48:45,260
The capture of General Grievous
will end this war.

482
00:48:46,391 --> 00:48:49,177
Quickly and decisively
we should proceed.

483
00:48:50,103 --> 00:48:54,313
The chancellor has requested...
that I lead the campaign.

484
00:48:55,108 --> 00:48:57,728
The council will make up
its own mind who is to go...

485
00:48:57,860 --> 00:48:59,817
not the chancellor.

486
00:48:59,945 --> 00:49:04,856
A master is needed,
with more experience.

487
00:49:04,992 --> 00:49:08,360
I concur.
Master Kenobi should go.

488
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:10,989
I agree.

489
00:49:11,123 --> 00:49:12,237
Aye.

490
00:49:12,373 --> 00:49:13,916
Aye.

491
00:49:14,041 --> 00:49:15,951
Very well. Council adjourned.

492
00:49:23,885 --> 00:49:26,554
The droids have started up
their main power generators.

493
00:49:27,387 --> 00:49:32,132
- Then now the time is, Commander.
- Yes, sir.

494
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:46,280
Charge!

495
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:03,329
Head for cover!

496
00:50:18,769 --> 00:50:21,641
- You're gonna need me on this one.
- I agree.

497
00:50:21,773 --> 00:50:24,608
However, it may turn out
just to be a wild bantha chase.

498
00:50:24,733 --> 00:50:25,849
Master.

499
00:50:27,778 --> 00:50:33,117
I've disappointed you. I haven't been
very appreciative of your training.

500
00:50:33,242 --> 00:50:36,990
I've been arrogant,
and I apologize.

501
00:50:37,746 --> 00:50:40,072
I've just been so frustrated
with the council.

502
00:50:43,418 --> 00:50:47,119
You are strong and wise, Anakin,
and I am very proud of you.

503
00:50:47,255 --> 00:50:49,829
I have trained you since
you were a small boy.

504
00:50:49,967 --> 00:50:52,043
I have taught you
everything I know.

505
00:50:52,177 --> 00:50:55,925
And you have become a far greater
Jedi than I could ever hope to be.

506
00:50:56,806 --> 00:50:58,715
But be patient, Anakin.

507
00:50:59,601 --> 00:51:02,766
It will not be long before
the council makes you a Jedi master.

508
00:51:10,152 --> 00:51:13,402
Obi-Wan.
May the Force be with you.

509
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:16,400
Goodbye, old friend.
May the Force be with you.

510
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:43,556
Fortunately, most of the cities are
concentrated on this small continent here.

511
00:51:43,684 --> 00:51:45,309
On the far side.

512
00:51:45,436 --> 00:51:47,724
I'll keep them distracted
until you get there.

513
00:51:47,855 --> 00:51:51,271
- Just don't take too long.
- Come on. When have I ever let you down?

514
00:51:52,693 --> 00:51:57,817
Very well. The burden is on me not to
destroy all the droids until you arrive.

515
00:52:23,262 --> 00:52:25,007
Save your energy.

516
00:52:25,724 --> 00:52:27,467
I can't.

517
00:52:27,601 --> 00:52:29,344
Don't give up, Padmé.

518
00:52:42,824 --> 00:52:44,697
Obi-Wan's been here, hasn't he?

519
00:52:45,409 --> 00:52:47,449
He came by this morning.

520
00:52:48,871 --> 00:52:50,744
What did he want?

521
00:52:50,873 --> 00:52:52,782
He's worried about you.

522
00:52:55,293 --> 00:52:57,534
He says you've been
under a lot of stress.

523
00:53:00,423 --> 00:53:02,083
I feel lost.

524
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:06,378
Lost? What do you mean?

525
00:53:08,306 --> 00:53:10,677
Obi-Wan and the council
don't trust me.

526
00:53:11,768 --> 00:53:14,175
They trust you with their lives.

527
00:53:15,938 --> 00:53:17,396
Something's happening.

528
00:53:18,565 --> 00:53:20,724
I'm not the Jedi I should be.

529
00:53:23,112 --> 00:53:25,021
I want more.

530
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:28,155
And I know I shouldn't.

531
00:53:30,284 --> 00:53:32,242
You expect too much of yourself.

532
00:53:36,248 --> 00:53:39,416
- I found a way to save you.
- Save me?

533
00:53:39,543 --> 00:53:41,452
From my nightmares.

534
00:53:41,588 --> 00:53:43,496
Is that what's bothering you?

535
00:53:44,548 --> 00:53:46,458
I won't lose you, Padmé.

536
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:49,376
I'm not gonna die in childbirth, Ani.

537
00:53:49,512 --> 00:53:51,918
- I promise you.
- No, I promise you.

538
00:54:35,889 --> 00:54:38,260
Greetings, young Jedi.

539
00:54:38,391 --> 00:54:41,806
What brings you to
our remote sanctuary?

540
00:54:41,936 --> 00:54:43,846
Unfortunately, the war.

541
00:54:44,646 --> 00:54:48,514
There's no war here-
unless you brought it with you.

542
00:54:48,650 --> 00:54:51,818
With your kind permission,
I should like some fuel...

543
00:54:51,945 --> 00:54:56,856
and to use your city as a base as I search
nearby systems for General Grievous.

544
00:55:05,876 --> 00:55:09,126
He is here.
We are being held hostage.

545
00:55:09,253 --> 00:55:12,125
- They are watching us.
- I understand.

546
00:55:12,257 --> 00:55:17,048
Tenth level,
thousands of battle droids.

547
00:55:17,177 --> 00:55:19,585
Tell your people to take shelter.

548
00:55:19,722 --> 00:55:22,675
If you have warriors, now is the time.

549
00:55:33,610 --> 00:55:37,822
Take the fighter back to the ship.
Tell Cody I've made contact.

550
00:55:39,782 --> 00:55:43,862
- Is he bringing additional warriors?
- He didn't say.

551
00:56:26,202 --> 00:56:31,409
It won't be long before the armies
of the Republic track us here.

552
00:56:34,043 --> 00:56:39,250
I am sending you to the Mustafar system
in the outer rim.

553
00:56:46,762 --> 00:56:49,052
It is a volcanic planet.

554
00:56:49,181 --> 00:56:52,467
- You will be safe there.
- Safe?

555
00:56:53,311 --> 00:56:56,561
Chancellor Palpatine managed
to escape your grip, General.

556
00:56:56,688 --> 00:57:01,101
Without Count Dooku, I have doubts
about your ability to keep us safe.

557
00:57:02,027 --> 00:57:07,152
Be thankful, Viceroy, you have not
found yourself in my grip.

558
00:57:10,661 --> 00:57:13,282
Your ship is waiting.

559
00:57:31,179 --> 00:57:32,425
Hello there.

560
00:57:35,101 --> 00:57:36,809
General Kenobi.

561
00:57:39,771 --> 00:57:42,309
You are a bold one.

562
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:45,818
Kill him.

563
00:58:01,668 --> 00:58:03,077
Back away.

564
00:58:03,210 --> 00:58:07,789
I will deal with
this Jedi slime myself.

565
00:58:07,923 --> 00:58:09,382
Your move.

566
00:58:10,217 --> 00:58:11,925
You fool.

567
00:58:12,052 --> 00:58:17,840
I've been trained in your
Jedi arts by Count Dooku.

568
00:58:24,396 --> 00:58:26,853
Attack, Kenobi.

569
00:59:43,222 --> 00:59:45,510
Army or not...

570
00:59:45,641 --> 00:59:50,717
you must realize
you are doomed.

571
00:59:50,853 --> 00:59:52,811
I don't think so.

572
01:00:51,244 --> 01:00:52,987
Cover that corner.

573
01:00:59,043 --> 01:01:01,083
Master Windu, may I interrupt?

574
01:01:01,213 --> 01:01:03,963
General Kenobi has made contact
with General Grievous...

575
01:01:04,090 --> 01:01:06,331
and we have begun our attack.

576
01:01:06,467 --> 01:01:08,175
Thank you, Commander.

577
01:01:08,302 --> 01:01:12,382
Anakin, deliver this report
to the chancellor.

578
01:01:12,514 --> 01:01:14,757
His reaction will give us
a clue to his intentions.

579
01:01:14,891 --> 01:01:16,351
Yes, Master.

580
01:01:23,818 --> 01:01:26,273
I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi.

581
01:01:27,195 --> 01:01:29,650
The dark side of the Force
surrounds the chancellor.

582
01:01:30,364 --> 01:01:32,572
If he does not give up
his emergency powers...

583
01:01:32,701 --> 01:01:34,574
after the destruction of Grievous...

584
01:01:34,702 --> 01:01:36,909
then he should be
removed from office.

585
01:01:38,414 --> 01:01:40,905
The Jedi Council would have to
take control of the senate...

586
01:01:41,041 --> 01:01:42,916
in order to secure
a peaceful transition.

587
01:01:43,043 --> 01:01:47,505
To a dark place this line
of thought will carry us.

588
01:01:49,759 --> 01:01:52,463
Great care we must take.

589
01:01:59,309 --> 01:02:00,768
Chancellor.

590
01:02:01,561 --> 01:02:04,052
We've just received a report
from Master Kenobi.

591
01:02:04,188 --> 01:02:06,809
He has engaged General Grievous.

592
01:02:06,942 --> 01:02:10,275
We can only hope that Master Kenobi
is up to the challenge.

593
01:02:12,155 --> 01:02:14,112
I should be there with him.

594
01:02:14,239 --> 01:02:16,565
It's upsetting to me
to see that the council...

595
01:02:16,701 --> 01:02:18,740
doesn't seem to fully appreciate
your talents.

596
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:24,159
Don't you wonder why
they won't make you a Jedi master?

597
01:02:25,876 --> 01:02:27,833
I wish I knew.

598
01:02:29,170 --> 01:02:31,661
More and more I get
the feeling that...

599
01:02:31,798 --> 01:02:34,005
I'm being excluded
from the council.

600
01:02:41,016 --> 01:02:44,929
I know there are things about the Force
that they're not telling me.

601
01:02:47,188 --> 01:02:49,596
They don't trust you, Anakin.

602
01:02:50,358 --> 01:02:52,351
They see your future.

603
01:02:52,485 --> 01:02:56,351
They know your power
will be too strong to control.

604
01:02:57,530 --> 01:03:02,572
You must break through the fog of lies
the Jedi have created around you.

605
01:03:04,621 --> 01:03:08,748
Let me help you to know
the subtleties of the Force.

606
01:03:09,501 --> 01:03:11,623
How do you know
the ways of the Force?

607
01:03:12,670 --> 01:03:15,706
My mentor taught me
everything about the Force.

608
01:03:16,507 --> 01:03:19,461
Even the nature of the dark side.

609
01:03:21,471 --> 01:03:23,795
You know the dark side?

610
01:03:26,434 --> 01:03:29,719
If one is to understand
the great mystery...

611
01:03:29,853 --> 01:03:32,226
one must study all its aspects...

612
01:03:32,356 --> 01:03:35,476
not just the dogmatic
narrow view of the Jedi.

613
01:03:36,235 --> 01:03:39,353
If you wish to become
a complete and wise leader...

614
01:03:39,487 --> 01:03:43,152
you must embrace
a larger view of the Force.

615
01:03:43,909 --> 01:03:45,900
Be careful of the Jedi, Anakin.

616
01:03:46,952 --> 01:03:52,112
Only through me can you achieve
a power greater than any Jedi.

617
01:03:52,876 --> 01:03:55,496
Learn to know
the dark side of the Force...

618
01:03:55,628 --> 01:03:59,246
and you will be able to
save your wife...

619
01:03:59,382 --> 01:04:01,420
from certain death.

620
01:04:02,550 --> 01:04:04,425
What did you say?

621
01:04:04,552 --> 01:04:08,170
Use my knowledge. I beg you.

622
01:04:09,891 --> 01:04:12,050
You're the Sith lord.

623
01:04:12,186 --> 01:04:16,016
I know what's been troubling you.
Listen to me.

624
01:04:17,023 --> 01:04:20,688
Don't continue to be a pawn
of the Jedi Council.

625
01:04:22,862 --> 01:04:26,277
Ever since I've known you,
you've been searching for a life...

626
01:04:26,407 --> 01:04:28,945
greater than that
of an ordinary Jedi.

627
01:04:29,077 --> 01:04:31,449
A life of significance...

628
01:04:31,579 --> 01:04:33,038
of conscience.

629
01:04:38,085 --> 01:04:42,331
- Are you going to kill me?
- I would certainly like to.

630
01:04:43,423 --> 01:04:45,795
I know you would.

631
01:04:45,925 --> 01:04:49,710
I can feel your anger.

632
01:04:49,846 --> 01:04:52,514
It gives you focus...

633
01:04:52,641 --> 01:04:54,965
makes you stronger.

634
01:05:01,273 --> 01:05:03,599
I'm going to turn you over
to the Jedi Council.

635
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:05,358
Of course. You should.

636
01:05:05,485 --> 01:05:08,487
But you're not sure
of their intentions, are you?

637
01:05:08,614 --> 01:05:11,105
I will quickly discover
the truth of all this.

638
01:05:12,284 --> 01:05:14,655
You have great wisdom, Anakin.

639
01:05:14,786 --> 01:05:18,405
Know the power of the dark side.

640
01:05:18,539 --> 01:05:21,291
Power to save Padmé.

641
01:07:29,831 --> 01:07:30,994
So uncivilized.

642
01:07:38,505 --> 01:07:40,498
Master Windu,
I must talk to you.

643
01:07:40,632 --> 01:07:44,416
Skywalker, we just received word that
Obi-Wan has destroyed General Grievous.

644
01:07:44,554 --> 01:07:46,427
We're on our way to make sure...

645
01:07:46,556 --> 01:07:48,797
the chancellor returns
emergency power back to the senate.

646
01:07:48,932 --> 01:07:52,550
He won't give up his power.
I've just learned a terrible truth.

647
01:07:52,686 --> 01:07:54,809
I think Chancellor Palpatine
is a Sith lord.

648
01:07:56,273 --> 01:07:57,815
A Sith lord?

649
01:07:57,940 --> 01:08:00,775
Yes. The one we've been looking for.

650
01:08:00,902 --> 01:08:03,902
- How do you know this?
- He knows the ways of the Force.

651
01:08:04,947 --> 01:08:07,070
He's been trained
to use the dark side.

652
01:08:07,199 --> 01:08:09,987
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

653
01:08:11,454 --> 01:08:13,659
Then our worst fears
have been realized.

654
01:08:13,789 --> 01:08:17,240
We must move quickly
if the Jedi order is to survive.

655
01:08:17,376 --> 01:08:19,783
Master, the chancellor
is very powerful.

656
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:22,162
You'll need my help
if you're going to arrest him.

657
01:08:22,297 --> 01:08:25,215
For you own good,
stay out of this affair.

658
01:08:25,341 --> 01:08:28,094
I sense a great deal of confusion
in you, young Skywalker.

659
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:30,342
There is much fear
that clouds your judgement.

660
01:08:30,471 --> 01:08:32,429
- I must go, Master.
- No.

661
01:08:34,643 --> 01:08:38,591
If what you've told me is true,
you will have gained my trust.

662
01:08:38,729 --> 01:08:41,268
But for now, remain here.

663
01:08:42,484 --> 01:08:45,270
Wait in the council chambers
until we return.

664
01:08:47,572 --> 01:08:48,817
Yes, Master.

665
01:09:18,935 --> 01:09:21,176
You do know, don't you...

666
01:09:21,311 --> 01:09:23,636
if theJedi destroy me...

667
01:09:23,773 --> 01:09:27,721
any chance of saving her
will be lost.

668
01:10:56,652 --> 01:11:01,064
Master Windu. I take it General Grievous
has been destroyed then.

669
01:11:02,033 --> 01:11:04,439
I must say you're here
sooner than expected.

670
01:11:04,577 --> 01:11:08,158
In the name of
the Galactic Senate of the Republic...

671
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:10,198
you're under arrest, Chancellor.

672
01:11:10,332 --> 01:11:12,904
Are you threatening me,
Master Jedi?

673
01:11:13,042 --> 01:11:14,952
The senate will decide your fate.

674
01:11:15,087 --> 01:11:18,917
- I am the senate.
- Not yet.

675
01:11:24,261 --> 01:11:26,587
It's treason then.

676
01:13:05,565 --> 01:13:09,100
You are under arrest, my lord.

677
01:13:10,237 --> 01:13:14,530
Anakin, I told you it would
come to this. I was right.

678
01:13:14,658 --> 01:13:16,780
The Jedi are taking over.

679
01:13:16,909 --> 01:13:19,365
The oppression of the Sith
will never return.

680
01:13:19,496 --> 01:13:21,702
You have lost.

681
01:13:25,585 --> 01:13:27,493
You will die!

682
01:13:30,256 --> 01:13:32,130
He's a traitor!

683
01:13:32,257 --> 01:13:34,417
He is the traitor!

684
01:13:37,596 --> 01:13:41,760
I have the power
to save the one you love.

685
01:13:42,768 --> 01:13:44,676
You must choose.

686
01:13:45,770 --> 01:13:48,344
Don't listen to him, Anakin!

687
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:52,063
Don't let him kill me.

688
01:13:55,197 --> 01:13:57,900
I can't hold it any longer.

689
01:13:59,242 --> 01:14:01,318
I can't. I'm weak.

690
01:14:01,453 --> 01:14:03,409
I'm too weak.

691
01:14:05,081 --> 01:14:07,537
Help me. Help me!

692
01:14:12,046 --> 01:14:14,203
I can't hold on any longer.

693
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:17,921
I am going to end this
once and for all.

694
01:14:18,051 --> 01:14:19,510
You can't.

695
01:14:19,636 --> 01:14:21,594
He must stand trial.

696
01:14:22,639 --> 01:14:25,046
He has control of
the senate and the courts.

697
01:14:25,184 --> 01:14:27,390
He's too dangerous
to be left alive.

698
01:14:27,519 --> 01:14:29,761
I'm too weak.

699
01:14:29,895 --> 01:14:33,479
- Don't kill me. Please.
- It's not the Jedi way.

700
01:14:33,608 --> 01:14:35,101
He must live.

701
01:14:38,238 --> 01:14:40,774
- Please don't.
- I need him.

702
01:14:41,823 --> 01:14:42,903
Please don't!

703
01:14:50,332 --> 01:14:51,957
Power!

704
01:14:58,506 --> 01:15:03,167
Unlimited power!

705
01:15:14,313 --> 01:15:16,353
What have I done?

706
01:15:24,657 --> 01:15:28,570
You're fulfilling your destiny, Anakin.

707
01:15:29,786 --> 01:15:32,490
Become my apprentice.

708
01:15:32,622 --> 01:15:38,042
Learn to use
the dark side of the Force.

709
01:15:40,712 --> 01:15:43,667
I will do whatever you ask.

710
01:15:45,885 --> 01:15:48,292
Good.

711
01:15:50,014 --> 01:15:52,587
Just help me save Padmé's life.

712
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:56,931
I can't live without her.

713
01:16:00,106 --> 01:16:05,480
To cheat death is a power
only one has achieved...

714
01:16:05,612 --> 01:16:08,565
but if we work together...

715
01:16:08,698 --> 01:16:12,695
I know we can discover the secret.

716
01:16:14,162 --> 01:16:16,154
I pledge myself...

717
01:16:17,873 --> 01:16:19,747
to your teachings.

718
01:16:21,002 --> 01:16:22,412
Good.

719
01:16:23,921 --> 01:16:25,712
Good.

720
01:16:33,971 --> 01:16:38,385
The Force is strong with you.

721
01:16:38,518 --> 01:16:44,057
A powerful Sith you will become.

722
01:16:44,189 --> 01:16:48,436
Henceforth you shall be known as...

723
01:16:48,569 --> 01:16:52,436
Darth... Vader.

724
01:16:57,411 --> 01:17:00,412
Thank you, my master.

725
01:17:02,623 --> 01:17:04,082
Rise.

726
01:17:18,555 --> 01:17:22,684
Because the council did not trust you,
my young apprentice...

727
01:17:24,270 --> 01:17:29,015
I believe you are the only Jedi
with no knowledge of this plot.

728
01:17:30,359 --> 01:17:33,064
When the Jedi learn
what has transpired here...

729
01:17:33,194 --> 01:17:37,109
they will kill us,
along with all the senators.

730
01:17:37,990 --> 01:17:39,367
I agree.

731
01:17:40,077 --> 01:17:43,944
The council's next move
will be against the senate.

732
01:17:44,079 --> 01:17:46,750
Every single Jedi...

733
01:17:46,875 --> 01:17:50,125
including your friend
Obi-Wan Kenobi...

734
01:17:50,252 --> 01:17:53,787
is now an enemy of the Republic.

735
01:17:54,841 --> 01:17:56,797
I understand, Master.

736
01:17:57,592 --> 01:17:59,502
We must move quickly.

737
01:17:59,636 --> 01:18:01,546
The Jedi are relentless.

738
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:07,469
If they are not all destroyed,
it will be civil war without end.

739
01:18:09,188 --> 01:18:12,970
First I want you to
go to the Jedi temple.

740
01:18:14,067 --> 01:18:17,103
We will catch them off-balance.

741
01:18:17,319 --> 01:18:21,186
Do what must be done, Lord Vader.

742
01:18:21,323 --> 01:18:24,693
Do not hesitate.
Show no mercy.

743
01:18:25,411 --> 01:18:30,155
Only then will you be strong enough
with the dark side...

744
01:18:30,291 --> 01:18:32,283
to save Padmé.

745
01:18:33,418 --> 01:18:37,251
What about the other Jedi
spread across the galaxy?

746
01:18:37,381 --> 01:18:40,465
Their betrayal will be dealt with.

747
01:18:42,386 --> 01:18:45,636
After you have killed
all the Jedi in the temple...

748
01:18:45,764 --> 01:18:48,432
go to the Mustafar system.

749
01:18:48,557 --> 01:18:51,807
Wipe out Viceroy Gunray...

750
01:18:51,935 --> 01:18:55,351
and the other
separatist leaders.

751
01:18:55,480 --> 01:19:01,354
Once more the Sith
will rule the galaxy!

752
01:19:02,613 --> 01:19:04,320
And...

753
01:19:04,448 --> 01:19:09,524
we shall have... peace.

754
01:19:52,743 --> 01:19:54,618
Sergeant, over here!

755
01:19:55,663 --> 01:19:57,573
Hurry! All of them!

756
01:20:00,376 --> 01:20:02,250
All Red units, let's move it!

757
01:20:02,377 --> 01:20:04,252
Come on. Let's go!

758
01:20:18,143 --> 01:20:20,136
Commander, contact your troops.

759
01:20:20,270 --> 01:20:22,179
Tell them to move to the higher levels.

760
01:20:22,314 --> 01:20:24,186
Very good, sir.

761
01:20:24,315 --> 01:20:26,439
By the way,
I think you'll be needing this.

762
01:20:27,277 --> 01:20:30,810
Thank you, Cody. Let's get a move on.
We've got a battle to win.

763
01:20:30,947 --> 01:20:32,109
Yes, sir.

764
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:40,372
Commander Cody...

765
01:20:41,082 --> 01:20:44,367
the time has come.

766
01:20:44,502 --> 01:20:48,747
Execute order 66.

767
01:20:49,506 --> 01:20:51,414
Yes, my lord.

768
01:20:55,302 --> 01:20:56,631
Blast him!

769
01:21:23,622 --> 01:21:24,997
Come on!

770
01:22:15,421 --> 01:22:18,706
Execute order 66.

771
01:22:19,716 --> 01:22:21,341
It will be done, my lord.

772
01:23:04,176 --> 01:23:06,132
It will be done, my lord.

773
01:23:43,003 --> 01:23:45,376
Master Skywalker,
there are too many of them.

774
01:23:45,506 --> 01:23:47,463
What are we going to do?

775
01:23:57,976 --> 01:24:02,104
The chancellor's office indicated Master
Anakin returned to the Jedi temple.

776
01:24:02,230 --> 01:24:05,314
Don't worry.
I'm sure he'll be all right.

777
01:24:34,552 --> 01:24:37,588
- What's going on here?
- There's been a rebellion, sir.

778
01:24:37,722 --> 01:24:40,296
Don't worry.
The situation is under control.

779
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:43,639
I'm sorry, sir.
It's time for you to leave.

780
01:24:45,396 --> 01:24:47,354
And so it is.

781
01:24:51,485 --> 01:24:52,944
Get him!

782
01:25:10,503 --> 01:25:12,377
Don't worry about him.
Let him go.

783
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:42,198
All these Wookiees are dead.
Move to the east.

784
01:25:42,326 --> 01:25:43,783
Yes, sir.

785
01:25:51,917 --> 01:25:53,792
Goodbye, Tarfful.

786
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:55,877
Goodbye, Chewbacca.

787
01:25:58,466 --> 01:26:00,588
Miss you I will.

788
01:26:37,627 --> 01:26:39,953
Hopefully we'll be able to
intercept a few Jedi...

789
01:26:40,088 --> 01:26:42,377
before they walk into
this catastrophe.

790
01:26:48,137 --> 01:26:50,046
Did you find Kenobi?

791
01:26:50,181 --> 01:26:52,091
Sir, no one could have
survived that fall.

792
01:26:53,143 --> 01:26:55,467
Start loading your men on the ships.

793
01:26:55,603 --> 01:26:57,061
Move it.

794
01:27:30,386 --> 01:27:32,378
Emergency code 913.

795
01:27:32,512 --> 01:27:34,386
I have no contact
on any frequency.

796
01:27:37,143 --> 01:27:38,552
Master Kenobi.

797
01:27:38,685 --> 01:27:40,643
- Repeat.
- Master Kenobi.

798
01:27:40,770 --> 01:27:44,685
Senator Organa. My clone troops
turned on me. I need help.

799
01:27:45,693 --> 01:27:47,565
We havejust rescued
Master Yoda.

800
01:27:47,694 --> 01:27:49,770
It appears this ambush
has happened everywhere.

801
01:27:49,904 --> 01:27:52,028
We're sending you our coordinates.

802
01:27:59,788 --> 01:28:01,662
Hush! Not so loud.

803
01:28:01,791 --> 01:28:04,792
Are you all right? I heard there was
an attack on the Jedi temple.

804
01:28:04,918 --> 01:28:07,291
- You could see the smoke from here.
- I'm fine.

805
01:28:07,421 --> 01:28:09,295
I came to see if
you and the baby are safe.

806
01:28:09,422 --> 01:28:11,047
What's happening?

807
01:28:11,926 --> 01:28:14,002
The Jedi have tried to
overthrow the Republic.

808
01:28:14,761 --> 01:28:16,635
I can't believe that.

809
01:28:16,764 --> 01:28:20,297
I saw Master Windu attempt to
assassinate the chancellor myself.

810
01:28:23,103 --> 01:28:24,894
What are you gonna do?

811
01:28:33,613 --> 01:28:35,770
I will not betray the Republic.

812
01:28:37,783 --> 01:28:39,693
My loyalties lie
with the chancellor...

813
01:28:40,869 --> 01:28:43,574
and with the senate
and with you.

814
01:28:44,372 --> 01:28:47,576
- What about Obi-Wan?
- I don't know.

815
01:28:48,335 --> 01:28:50,411
Many Jedi have been killed.

816
01:28:50,546 --> 01:28:53,381
We can only hope that
he's remained loyal to the chancellor.

817
01:28:54,466 --> 01:28:56,791
Anakin, I'm afraid.

818
01:28:59,804 --> 01:29:01,844
Have faith, my love.

819
01:29:01,972 --> 01:29:04,261
Everything will soon be set right.

820
01:29:05,059 --> 01:29:08,144
The chancellor has given me
a very important mission.

821
01:29:08,270 --> 01:29:11,105
The separatists have gathered
on the Mustafar system.

822
01:29:11,858 --> 01:29:15,689
I'm going there to end this war.
Wait for me until I return.

823
01:29:15,819 --> 01:29:18,192
Things will be different.
I promise.

824
01:29:24,036 --> 01:29:25,993
Please, wait for me.

825
01:29:30,082 --> 01:29:32,787
Well, he is under
a lot of stress, R2.

826
01:29:35,046 --> 01:29:36,954
Take care, my little friend.

827
01:29:41,260 --> 01:29:44,925
Oh, my lady,
is there anything I might do?

828
01:29:45,055 --> 01:29:47,594
No, thank you, 3PO.

829
01:29:49,976 --> 01:29:52,385
I feel so helpless.

830
01:30:15,960 --> 01:30:18,581
How many other Jedi
have managed to survive?

831
01:30:18,712 --> 01:30:21,250
Heard from no one have we.

832
01:30:22,132 --> 01:30:25,216
I saw thousands of troops
attack the Jedi temple.

833
01:30:25,344 --> 01:30:27,217
That's why I went looking for Yoda.

834
01:30:27,345 --> 01:30:29,752
Have we had any contact
from the temple?

835
01:30:29,890 --> 01:30:32,844
Received a coded
retreat message we have.

836
01:30:33,726 --> 01:30:36,976
It requests all Jedi
to return to the temple.

837
01:30:37,104 --> 01:30:40,520
- It says the war is over.
- Then we must go back.

838
01:30:40,649 --> 01:30:44,149
If there are any stragglers, they will
fall into the trap and be killed.

839
01:30:45,320 --> 01:30:49,069
Suggest dismantling
the coded signal, do you?

840
01:30:49,199 --> 01:30:51,904
Yes, Master.
There is too much at stake.

841
01:30:53,037 --> 01:30:54,578
I agree.

842
01:30:54,704 --> 01:30:58,287
And a little more knowledge
might light our way.

843
01:31:19,270 --> 01:31:22,685
The plan has gone
as you had promised, my lord.

844
01:31:22,814 --> 01:31:25,567
You have done well, Viceroy.

845
01:31:25,693 --> 01:31:31,481
When my new apprentice
Darth Vader arrives...

846
01:31:31,614 --> 01:31:35,113
he will take care of you.

847
01:31:47,505 --> 01:31:49,877
We're receiving a message from
the chancellor's office, sir.

848
01:31:50,007 --> 01:31:51,917
- Send it through.
- Yes, sir.

849
01:31:53,677 --> 01:31:58,338
Senator Organa, the supreme chancellor
requests your presence...

850
01:31:58,474 --> 01:32:00,430
at a special session of Congress.

851
01:32:00,559 --> 01:32:04,094
- I will be there.
- He'll be expecting you.

852
01:32:07,106 --> 01:32:10,356
- Could be a trap.
- I don't think so.

853
01:32:10,484 --> 01:32:13,569
The chancellor will not be able to
control the thousands of star systems...

854
01:32:13,697 --> 01:32:15,605
without keeping
the senate intact.

855
01:32:16,448 --> 01:32:19,734
If a special session
of Congress there is...

856
01:32:19,868 --> 01:32:23,154
easier for us to enter
the Jedi temple it will be.

857
01:33:01,658 --> 01:33:03,615
R2, stay with the ship.

858
01:33:29,060 --> 01:33:32,060
Welcome, Lord Vader.
We've been expecting you.

859
01:34:03,926 --> 01:34:08,421
And the Jedi rebellion
has been foiled.

860
01:34:08,555 --> 01:34:09,587
What's happened?

861
01:34:09,722 --> 01:34:14,219
The chancellor's been elaborating on a
plot by the Jedi to overthrow the senate.

862
01:34:14,353 --> 01:34:19,809
The remaining Jedi will be
hunted down and defeated.

863
01:34:35,622 --> 01:34:38,078
Not even the younglings survived.

864
01:34:39,210 --> 01:34:44,547
Killed not by clones this Padawan.

865
01:34:45,591 --> 01:34:48,212
By a lightsabre he was.

866
01:34:55,100 --> 01:34:56,641
Who?

867
01:34:56,768 --> 01:34:58,641
Who could have done this?

868
01:35:09,363 --> 01:35:12,529
The attempt on my life...

869
01:35:12,658 --> 01:35:17,533
has left me scarred and deformed.

870
01:35:18,497 --> 01:35:21,367
But I assure you.

871
01:35:21,500 --> 01:35:26,207
My resolve has never been stronger!

872
01:35:30,425 --> 01:35:31,622
Stop!

873
01:35:44,604 --> 01:35:50,228
In order to ensure the security
and continuing stability...

874
01:35:50,359 --> 01:35:54,228
the Republic will be reorganized...

875
01:35:54,363 --> 01:35:59,819
into the first Galactic Empire!

876
01:36:00,744 --> 01:36:06,581
For a safe and secure society.

877
01:36:16,010 --> 01:36:18,048
So this is how liberty dies.

878
01:36:18,804 --> 01:36:21,509
With thunderous applause.

879
01:36:23,934 --> 01:36:26,091
The war is over.

880
01:36:26,228 --> 01:36:30,355
Lord Sidious promised us peace.
We only want-

881
01:36:38,488 --> 01:36:43,150
I have recalibrated the code,
warning all surviving Jedi to stay away.

882
01:36:43,286 --> 01:36:45,693
For the clones...

883
01:36:45,829 --> 01:36:49,909
to discover the recalibration
a long time it will take.

884
01:37:02,261 --> 01:37:03,720
Wait. Master.

885
01:37:05,265 --> 01:37:07,590
There is something I must know.

886
01:37:13,730 --> 01:37:18,144
If into the security recordings you go,
only pain will you find.

887
01:37:18,277 --> 01:37:20,814
I must know the truth, Master.

888
01:37:28,619 --> 01:37:30,529
It can't be.

889
01:37:30,663 --> 01:37:32,537
It can't be.

890
01:37:32,666 --> 01:37:36,710
You have done well,
my new apprentice.

891
01:37:36,836 --> 01:37:39,837
Now, Lord Vader...

892
01:37:39,963 --> 01:37:43,463
go and bring peace to the Empire.

893
01:37:43,592 --> 01:37:45,751
I can't watch any more.

894
01:37:46,511 --> 01:37:50,426
Destroy the Sith we must.

895
01:37:52,225 --> 01:37:54,301
Send me to kill the emperor.

896
01:37:54,435 --> 01:37:56,677
I will not kill Anakin.

897
01:37:56,814 --> 01:38:01,521
To fight this Lord Sidious,
strong enough you are not.

898
01:38:01,652 --> 01:38:04,902
He is like my brother.
I cannot do it.

899
01:38:05,654 --> 01:38:10,697
Twisted by the dark side
young Skywalker has become.

900
01:38:10,827 --> 01:38:14,195
The boy you trained, gone he is.

901
01:38:14,329 --> 01:38:17,201
Consumed by Darth Vader.

902
01:38:17,332 --> 01:38:20,333
I do not know where
the emperor has sent him.

903
01:38:20,461 --> 01:38:22,667
I don't know where to look.

904
01:38:24,006 --> 01:38:27,671
Use your feelings, Obi-Wan,
and find him you will.

905
01:38:38,228 --> 01:38:40,220
When was the last time
you saw him?

906
01:38:40,939 --> 01:38:44,307
- Yesterday.
- And do you know where he is now?

907
01:38:47,487 --> 01:38:50,819
Padmé, I need your help.

908
01:38:51,532 --> 01:38:54,153
- He is in grave danger.
- From the Sith?

909
01:38:54,952 --> 01:38:56,411
From himself.

910
01:39:00,873 --> 01:39:03,246
Anakin has turned to the dark side.

911
01:39:03,377 --> 01:39:06,828
You're wrong.
How could you even say that?

912
01:39:09,632 --> 01:39:14,627
I have seen
a security hologram... of him...

913
01:39:16,264 --> 01:39:17,971
killing younglings.

914
01:39:18,099 --> 01:39:21,135
Not Anakin. He couldn't.

915
01:39:21,894 --> 01:39:24,182
He was deceived by a lie.
We all were.

916
01:39:25,064 --> 01:39:28,811
It appears that the chancellor
is behind everything, including the war.

917
01:39:30,653 --> 01:39:33,356
Palpatine is the Sith lord
we've been looking for.

918
01:39:33,488 --> 01:39:37,569
After the death of Count Dooku,
Anakin became his new apprentice.

919
01:39:43,789 --> 01:39:45,747
I don't believe you.

920
01:39:47,167 --> 01:39:48,627
I can't.

921
01:39:56,844 --> 01:39:59,086
I must find him.

922
01:40:01,222 --> 01:40:03,547
You're going to kill him,
aren't you?

923
01:40:07,270 --> 01:40:09,725
He has become
a very great threat.

924
01:40:12,359 --> 01:40:13,818
I can't.

925
01:40:27,539 --> 01:40:29,448
Anakin is the father, isn't he?

926
01:40:33,878 --> 01:40:35,836
I'm so sorry.

927
01:41:21,966 --> 01:41:24,088
- Milady, let me come with you.
- There's no danger.

928
01:41:24,219 --> 01:41:26,176
The fighting's over.
And this is personal.

929
01:41:26,304 --> 01:41:28,676
As you wish, milady,
but I strongly disagree.

930
01:41:28,805 --> 01:41:32,423
I'll be all right, Captain.
This is something I must do myself.

931
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:34,931
Besides, 3PO will look after me.

932
01:41:37,189 --> 01:41:38,648
Oh, dear.

933
01:41:50,618 --> 01:41:54,237
Do you know? I think I'm beginning to
get the hang of this flying business.

934
01:42:22,606 --> 01:42:26,023
The separatists have been
taken care of, my master.

935
01:42:26,152 --> 01:42:29,023
It is finished then.

936
01:42:30,448 --> 01:42:36,237
You have restored peace
and justice to the galaxy.

937
01:42:37,037 --> 01:42:41,248
Send a message to the ships
of the Trade Federation.

938
01:42:42,083 --> 01:42:46,545
All droid units
must shut down immediately.

939
01:42:47,422 --> 01:42:49,380
Very good, my lord.

940
01:43:48,646 --> 01:43:50,722
I saw your ship.

941
01:43:53,569 --> 01:43:56,569
- What are you doing out here?
- I was so worried about you.

942
01:43:58,030 --> 01:44:00,865
Obi-Wan told me terrible things.

943
01:44:00,992 --> 01:44:02,533
What things?

944
01:44:03,243 --> 01:44:06,162
He said you've turned
to the dark side.

945
01:44:06,288 --> 01:44:10,914
That you... killed younglings.

946
01:44:12,462 --> 01:44:15,131
Obi-Wan is trying
to turn you against me.

947
01:44:15,256 --> 01:44:17,130
He cares about us.

948
01:44:17,841 --> 01:44:19,003
Us?

949
01:44:19,135 --> 01:44:20,592
He knows.

950
01:44:21,970 --> 01:44:23,844
He wants to help you.

951
01:44:27,684 --> 01:44:30,934
Anakin, all I want is your love.

952
01:44:31,063 --> 01:44:33,387
Love won't save you, Padmé.

953
01:44:33,523 --> 01:44:36,725
- Only my new powers can do that.
- At what cost?

954
01:44:36,859 --> 01:44:39,231
You're a good person.
Don't do this.

955
01:44:39,362 --> 01:44:42,067
I won't lose you
the way I lost my mother.

956
01:44:42,198 --> 01:44:46,408
I am becoming more powerful
than any Jedi has ever dreamed of.

957
01:44:46,536 --> 01:44:49,323
And I'm doing it for you.
To protect you.

958
01:44:50,663 --> 01:44:52,622
Come away with me.

959
01:44:53,375 --> 01:44:55,368
Help me raise our child.

960
01:44:55,502 --> 01:44:58,288
Leave everything else behind
while we still can.

961
01:44:58,421 --> 01:45:02,336
Don't you see?
We don't have to run away any more.

962
01:45:03,176 --> 01:45:05,667
I have brought peace
to the Republic.

963
01:45:06,720 --> 01:45:08,630
I am more powerful
than the chancellor.

964
01:45:08,765 --> 01:45:10,841
I can overthrow him.

965
01:45:12,935 --> 01:45:15,971
And together,
you and I can rule the galaxy...

966
01:45:16,104 --> 01:45:18,512
make things the way
we want them to be.

967
01:45:24,863 --> 01:45:26,855
I don't believe what I'm hearing.

968
01:45:28,367 --> 01:45:31,652
Obi-Wan was right.
You've changed.

969
01:45:33,872 --> 01:45:36,707
I don't want to hear
any more about Obi-Wan.

970
01:45:37,583 --> 01:45:41,000
The Jedi turned against me.
Don't you turn against me.

971
01:45:42,713 --> 01:45:44,706
I don't know you any more.

972
01:45:48,427 --> 01:45:50,385
You're breaking my heart.

973
01:45:51,096 --> 01:45:54,051
You're going down a path
I can't follow.

974
01:45:55,059 --> 01:45:56,931
Because of Obi-Wan?

975
01:45:57,728 --> 01:45:59,804
Because of what you've done.

976
01:45:59,938 --> 01:46:01,847
What you plan to do.

977
01:46:03,108 --> 01:46:05,729
Stop. Stop now. Come back.

978
01:46:05,860 --> 01:46:08,778
- I love you.
- Liar!

979
01:46:13,618 --> 01:46:17,365
You're with him!
You brought him here to kill me.

980
01:46:18,831 --> 01:46:20,408
Let her go, Anakin.

981
01:46:23,627 --> 01:46:25,786
Let her go.

982
01:46:35,805 --> 01:46:37,797
You turned her against me!

983
01:46:39,434 --> 01:46:41,592
You have done that yourself.

984
01:46:46,356 --> 01:46:48,515
You will not
take her from me!

985
01:46:48,650 --> 01:46:52,483
Your anger and your lust for power
have already done that.

986
01:46:56,449 --> 01:47:00,779
You have allowed this dark lord
to twist your mind...

987
01:47:02,372 --> 01:47:05,538
until now you have become
the very thing you swore to destroy.

988
01:47:05,667 --> 01:47:07,541
Don't lecture me, Obi-Wan.

989
01:47:07,668 --> 01:47:10,159
I see through
the lies of the Jedi.

990
01:47:11,297 --> 01:47:13,670
I do not fear
the dark side as you do.

991
01:47:15,510 --> 01:47:17,418
I have brought peace...

992
01:47:17,554 --> 01:47:22,298
freedom, justice and security
to my new empire.

993
01:47:23,309 --> 01:47:25,431
Your new empire?

994
01:47:26,270 --> 01:47:28,310
Don't make me kill you.

995
01:47:29,689 --> 01:47:34,185
Anakin, my allegiance is to
the Republic, to democracy!

996
01:47:35,069 --> 01:47:37,027
If you're not with me...

997
01:47:37,948 --> 01:47:39,822
then you're my enemy.

998
01:47:41,868 --> 01:47:44,323
Only a Sith deals in absolutes.

999
01:47:46,872 --> 01:47:48,747
I will do what I must.

1000
01:47:49,458 --> 01:47:51,831
You will try.

1001
01:48:23,615 --> 01:48:27,613
I hear a new apprentice
you have, Emperor.

1002
01:48:27,744 --> 01:48:32,206
Or should I call you
Darth Sidious?

1003
01:48:32,332 --> 01:48:34,905
Master Yoda.

1004
01:48:35,043 --> 01:48:36,703
You survived.

1005
01:48:37,587 --> 01:48:38,962
Surprised?

1006
01:48:39,672 --> 01:48:44,252
Your arrogance blinds you,
Master Yoda.

1007
01:48:44,386 --> 01:48:46,425
Now you will experience...

1008
01:48:46,555 --> 01:48:51,015
the full power of the dark side.

1009
01:49:32,974 --> 01:49:38,644
I have waited a long time
for this moment...

1010
01:49:38,770 --> 01:49:43,930
my little green friend.

1011
01:49:54,161 --> 01:49:57,612
At last the Jedi are no more.

1012
01:49:57,747 --> 01:50:01,958
Not if anything
to say about it I have.

1013
01:50:07,297 --> 01:50:09,622
At an end your rule is.

1014
01:50:11,510 --> 01:50:13,966
And not short enough it was.

1015
01:50:18,725 --> 01:50:20,931
If so powerful you are...

1016
01:50:22,186 --> 01:50:23,645
why leave?

1017
01:50:24,605 --> 01:50:27,144
You will not stop me.

1018
01:50:27,274 --> 01:50:31,854
Darth Vader will become
more powerful than either of us.

1019
01:50:31,988 --> 01:50:36,317
Faith in your new apprentice
misplaced may be.

1020
01:50:37,659 --> 01:50:41,704
As is your faith
in the dark side of the Force.

1021
01:55:09,333 --> 01:55:12,038
Hurry. Careful timing we will need.

1022
01:55:12,170 --> 01:55:14,957
Activate your homing beacon
when you're ready.

1023
01:55:15,090 --> 01:55:17,414
There's no sign of his body, sir.

1024
01:55:17,551 --> 01:55:21,168
- Then he is not dead.
- Double your search.

1025
01:55:21,304 --> 01:55:23,546
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

1026
01:55:24,640 --> 01:55:28,720
Tell Captain Kagi to prepare my shuttle
for immediate take-off.

1027
01:55:28,853 --> 01:55:33,930
- Yes, Master.
- I sense Lord Vader is in danger.

1028
01:56:42,756 --> 01:56:45,922
Into exile I must go.

1029
01:56:46,635 --> 01:56:48,711
Failed I have.

1030
01:58:28,148 --> 01:58:30,056
I have failed you, Anakin.

1031
01:58:30,192 --> 01:58:32,064
I have failed you.

1032
01:58:32,193 --> 01:58:35,064
I should have known the Jedi
were plotting to take over.

1033
01:58:35,195 --> 01:58:37,983
Anakin, Chancellor Palpatine is evil!

1034
01:58:38,115 --> 01:58:40,737
From my point of view,
the Jedi are evil.

1035
01:58:40,868 --> 01:58:42,445
Then you are lost!

1036
01:58:54,338 --> 01:58:56,829
This is the end for you, my master.

1037
01:59:21,364 --> 01:59:24,484
It's over, Anakin.
I have the high ground.

1038
01:59:27,162 --> 01:59:29,831
You underestimate my power.

1039
01:59:30,623 --> 01:59:32,332
Don't try it.

1040
01:59:55,229 --> 01:59:57,188
You were the chosen one!

1041
01:59:58,692 --> 02:00:01,859
It was said that you would destroy
the Sith, not join them!

1042
02:00:04,530 --> 02:00:08,314
Bring balance to the Force,
not leave it in darkness!

1043
02:00:20,003 --> 02:00:22,328
I hate you!

1044
02:00:29,762 --> 02:00:32,051
You were my brother, Anakin.

1045
02:00:34,100 --> 02:00:36,426
I loved you.

1046
02:01:17,475 --> 02:01:20,391
Master Kenobi.
We have Miss Padmé on board.

1047
02:01:20,520 --> 02:01:22,595
Yes. Please, please hurry.

1048
02:01:22,729 --> 02:01:25,564
We should leave this dreadful place.

1049
02:01:41,122 --> 02:01:43,079
Is Anakin all right?

1050
02:02:51,898 --> 02:02:53,854
Your Majesty, this way.

1051
02:02:54,817 --> 02:02:56,690
There he is.

1052
02:02:56,819 --> 02:02:58,978
He's still alive.

1053
02:03:01,990 --> 02:03:04,197
Get a medical capsule immediately.

1054
02:03:04,326 --> 02:03:06,283
Yes, sir. Right away.

1055
02:03:42,279 --> 02:03:44,188
Excuse me, Master Yoda.

1056
02:03:50,119 --> 02:03:52,278
Obi-Wan Kenobi has made contact.

1057
02:04:09,137 --> 02:04:11,545
We'll take her to
the medical centre. Quickly.

1058
02:04:41,877 --> 02:04:44,083
Medically, she's completely healthy.

1059
02:04:44,212 --> 02:04:47,416
For reasons we can't explain,
we are losing her.

1060
02:04:48,801 --> 02:04:51,505
- She's dying?
- We don't know why.

1061
02:04:51,636 --> 02:04:53,676
She has lost the will to live.

1062
02:04:53,805 --> 02:04:56,925
We need to operate quickly
if we are to save the babies.

1063
02:04:57,057 --> 02:04:58,636
Babies?

1064
02:04:58,768 --> 02:05:00,641
She's carrying twins.

1065
02:05:42,810 --> 02:05:44,269
Luke.

1066
02:05:52,485 --> 02:05:53,944
Oh, Luke.

1067
02:06:16,425 --> 02:06:18,750
- It's a girl.
- Leia.

1068
02:07:08,224 --> 02:07:10,097
There's good in him.

1069
02:07:12,811 --> 02:07:14,186
I know.

1070
02:07:14,896 --> 02:07:18,479
I know there's... still-

1071
02:07:53,725 --> 02:07:55,185
Lord Vader.

1072
02:07:56,520 --> 02:07:58,643
Can you hear me?

1073
02:08:01,692 --> 02:08:03,149
Yes, Master.

1074
02:08:06,279 --> 02:08:08,153
Where is Padmé?

1075
02:08:09,990 --> 02:08:11,864
Is she safe?

1076
02:08:12,993 --> 02:08:14,987
Is she all right?

1077
02:08:16,706 --> 02:08:21,248
It seems, in your anger,
you killed her.

1078
02:08:22,295 --> 02:08:25,164
I? I couldn't have.

1079
02:08:25,296 --> 02:08:28,297
She was alive. I felt it!

1080
02:09:02,248 --> 02:09:05,867
Hidden, safe the children must be kept.

1081
02:09:07,671 --> 02:09:11,206
We must take them somewhere where
the Sith will not sense their presence.

1082
02:09:13,760 --> 02:09:15,882
Split up they should be.

1083
02:09:16,595 --> 02:09:18,505
My wife and I will take the girl.

1084
02:09:20,099 --> 02:09:22,970
We've always talked
of adopting a baby girl.

1085
02:09:23,101 --> 02:09:25,344
She will be loved with us.

1086
02:09:26,271 --> 02:09:28,229
And what of the boy?

1087
02:09:29,190 --> 02:09:32,690
To Tatooine.
To his family send him.

1088
02:09:34,529 --> 02:09:36,936
I will take the child
and watch over him.

1089
02:09:42,412 --> 02:09:46,077
Until the time is right,
disappear we will.

1090
02:09:47,917 --> 02:09:51,500
Master Kenobi, wait a moment.

1091
02:09:53,046 --> 02:09:58,253
In your solitude on Tatooine,
training I have for you.

1092
02:09:59,595 --> 02:10:00,876
Training?

1093
02:10:01,012 --> 02:10:05,591
An old friend has learned
the path to immortality.

1094
02:10:07,645 --> 02:10:10,729
One who has returned from
the netherworld of the Force.

1095
02:10:10,855 --> 02:10:13,262
Your old master.

1096
02:10:13,984 --> 02:10:15,443
Qui-Gon?

1097
02:10:17,988 --> 02:10:21,238
How to commune with him
I will teach you.

1098
02:10:22,742 --> 02:10:24,864
- Captain Antilles.
- Yes, Your Highness?

1099
02:10:24,993 --> 02:10:26,868
I'm placing these droids
in your care.

1100
02:10:26,996 --> 02:10:28,869
Treat them well.
Clean them up.

1101
02:10:28,997 --> 02:10:30,872
Have the protocol droid's
mind wiped.

1102
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:32,458
What? 
