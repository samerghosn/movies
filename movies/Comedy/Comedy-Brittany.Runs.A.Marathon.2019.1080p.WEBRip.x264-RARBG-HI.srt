Oh, what is it? Adderall?

you're five-six, 197 pounds.

81
00:04:00,762 --> 00:04:03,852

give you Adderall,

that you're seeing a doctor.

between 45 and 55 pounds.

Hey, I know
it's hard to hear.

107

And look, a lot of people
struggle with their weight

108
00:05:14,617 --> 00:05:17,273
because of thyroid issues
and genetic predispositions,

109

said, um, "as low,"

$129 for a month.

that's a starting rate.

can go outside, though,

Absolutely.

a woman when her water broke.

344
00:20:10,991 --> 00:20:12,819
[chuckles]
I don't get it.

345
00:20:12,993 --> 00:20:15,125
No? Just... Oh.

346
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,692
Eh. Bye.

347
00:20:16,866 --> 00:20:19,260
Your sister is always
moving and shaking

348
00:20:19,434 --> 00:20:21,611
and walking around
and doing stuff.

349
00:20:21,785 --> 00:20:24,179
She won't sit down
for nothing.

350
00:20:24,353 --> 00:20:26,876
On Saturday, she's spearheading
a Habitat for Humanity.

351
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:28,836
What are you doing
this weekend?

352
00:20:29,009 --> 00:20:32,317
[groans]
My legs are so sore.

353
00:20:34,144 --> 00:20:36,799
Would you ever want to go
for a run with me?

354
00:20:36,973 --> 00:20:39,193
I just got in my head.

355
00:20:39,367 --> 00:20:40,760
I want to find a way
to distract myself

356
00:20:40,934 --> 00:20:43,067
so I can get to the point
where I can run a mile.

357
00:20:43,241 --> 00:20:47,375
If I do too much cardio,
I get too skinny too quickly. Remember?

358
00:20:47,549 --> 00:20:49,203
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

359
00:20:49,377 --> 00:20:51,162
Yeah, don't do that.

360
00:20:51,336 --> 00:20:53,512
Boink. [chuckles]

361
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,910
Okay, welcome, or welcome back,
to Astoria Runners Group.

362
00:21:00,084 --> 00:21:03,000
- Hoody-hoo!
- [group whooping, clapping]

363
00:21:05,786 --> 00:21:08,701
I'm Tesla, the organizer.
We're going a light two miles today.

364
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,007
Oh, my God.

365
00:21:10,181 --> 00:21:11,443
Springing
for nine-minute miles,

366
00:21:11,617 --> 00:21:13,663
so if that's your goal,
keep up with me.

367
00:21:13,836 --> 00:21:15,056
You ready?
Yeah!

368
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:17,231
On your marks, get set...
[group] Hoody-hoo!

369
00:21:17,405 --> 00:21:20,234
[runners whooping, clapping]

370
00:21:27,547 --> 00:21:30,680
[panting]

371
00:21:34,509 --> 00:21:36,859
[panting]
flap.

372
00:21:39,384 --> 00:21:41,604
[exhales]
You can do it.

373
00:21:41,778 --> 00:21:43,213
Yeah, I know.
I'm doing it.

374
00:21:43,388 --> 00:21:46,305
Oh, sorry.
I'm talking to myself.

375
00:21:46,479 --> 00:21:49,960
I can't give up,
or my kid'll judge me.

376
00:21:50,134 --> 00:21:53,921
I hyperventilated after a potato
sack race at his preschool.

377
00:21:54,095 --> 00:21:57,184
He was like,
"Papa, are you my mommy?"

378
00:21:57,358 --> 00:22:00,666
And I was like,
"No, I'm your papa."

379
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:04,497
And he was like,
"Well, why are you so girly?"

380
00:22:04,671 --> 00:22:07,804
So, I taught him about
gender stereotyping.

381
00:22:07,978 --> 00:22:12,548
I went on my first run,
and in six weeks, I'm running a 5K.

382
00:22:12,721 --> 00:22:14,507
Why are you doing that
to yourself?

383
00:22:14,681 --> 00:22:15,942
You're gonna
lose that thing.

384
00:22:16,116 --> 00:22:17,727
The race?
Yeah.

385
00:22:17,901 --> 00:22:20,643
You don't do it to win it.
You do it to finish it.

386
00:22:22,252 --> 00:22:25,256
You can do it, Seth.
You're a goddamn gazelle.

387
00:22:25,431 --> 00:22:26,866
Adherence
is half the battle.

388
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:27,911
[Seth groans]

389
00:22:28,085 --> 00:22:30,913
[panting]

390
00:22:31,087 --> 00:22:34,395
Wait.
That was two miles?

391
00:22:34,569 --> 00:22:36,006
I've never done that before
in my life.

392
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,660
Hoody-hoo!

393
00:22:39,052 --> 00:22:41,447
Yeah.
What's your name?

394
00:22:42,751 --> 00:22:43,752
I'm Brittany.

395
00:22:43,926 --> 00:22:45,276

00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:12,913
- And she had the same dress on as me.
- Sure, sure, sure.

404
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,786
- Britt!
- Gretch!

405
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,266
Britt, let's blaze.

406
00:23:19,875 --> 00:23:22,704
flaping New York.

407
00:23:25,882 --> 00:23:28,842
What was it
my friend wanted?

408
00:23:29,016 --> 00:23:31,321
Uh...

409
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:38,765
Oh, that's on backwards.

410
00:23:38,939 --> 00:23:40,767
[laughs]
Come on, it's funny.

411
00:23:40,941 --> 00:23:43,073
Okay, I'll fix it.

412
00:23:57,697 --> 00:24:00,263
- [Brittany chuckling]
- What? Brittany, oh, my God.

413
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,788
Oh, hey, we need shots.

414
00:24:01,961 --> 00:24:04,660
My roommate here literally
lost a hundred pounds.

415
00:24:04,834 --> 00:24:06,618
Well, 22.

416
00:24:06,792 --> 00:24:10,536
Still, that's, like,
the same weight as 11 MacBooks.

417
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:12,798
[British accent] I got a dozen
less laptops in me stomach.

418
00:24:12,972 --> 00:24:14,583
[crowd exclaiming]

419
00:24:14,757 --> 00:24:17,412
[man]
19-20.

420
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,243
I, uh... I found this
health calculator online,

421
00:24:23,417 --> 00:24:26,028
which is kind of cool,
and I have a goal weight now.

422
00:24:26,202 --> 00:24:28,467
Yeah? What is it, like 120?

423
00:24:29,205 --> 00:24:31,251
Uh, 152.

424
00:24:31,425 --> 00:24:34,820
My blood pressure's down,
and I even signed up for my first 5K.

425
00:24:34,994 --> 00:24:36,518
Shut up.
You're gonna run a marathon?

426
00:24:36,692 --> 00:24:40,740
No, a marathon's 26 miles.
5K's only three.

427
00:24:40,913 --> 00:24:43,133
Oh, my gosh, thank you
for the support, Terrence.

428
00:24:43,307 --> 00:24:44,917
[Gretchen]
Well, cool.

429
00:24:45,092 --> 00:24:47,355
Are you gonna try and run faster
than the other people or...

430
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:49,269
Oh, it's just about
finishing it.

431
00:24:49,443 --> 00:24:52,447
Oh, you should come out after with
me and my running friend, Seth.

432
00:24:52,621 --> 00:24:54,579
[Gretchen] Uh, wait.
[crowd exclaiming]

433
00:24:54,753 --> 00:24:57,233
- Running friend, Seth?
- Yeah.

434
00:24:57,407 --> 00:24:58,671
You never mentioned him
before.

435
00:24:58,845 --> 00:25:01,717
Is he a serious runner,
or is he like you?

436
00:25:02,848 --> 00:25:04,459
He's like me, I guess.

437
00:25:04,633 --> 00:25:08,810
Terrence, babe,
tell Brittany you're excited for her.

438
00:25:08,984 --> 00:25:11,378
[Terrence]
Yeah.

439
00:25:11,553 --> 00:25:12,510
[man]
20-20.

440
00:25:16,252 --> 00:25:19,518
[runners whooping, murmuring]

441
00:25:25,611 --> 00:25:27,916
[runners] And seven, six,

442
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:30,223
five, four,

443
00:25:30,397 --> 00:25:33,880
three, two, one.

444
00:25:34,054 --> 00:25:36,883
[air horn blares]
[runners cheering]

445
00:25:37,057 --> 00:25:38,971
[both panting]

446
00:25:39,145 --> 00:25:40,843
Oh, my God.

447
00:25:47,458 --> 00:25:50,156
We're going backwards.
[Seth exhales]

448
00:25:51,157 --> 00:25:52,724
Oh, my God.

449
00:25:52,898 --> 00:25:54,596
[runners shouting excitedly]

450
00:25:54,769 --> 00:25:58,773
[man] All right! Good job!
[man 2] Proud of you guys.

451
00:26:00,732 --> 00:26:02,385
[Seth sighs]

452
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,040
How's my baby?
Doing okay?

453
00:26:05,214 --> 00:26:06,694
[man]
I'm so tired.

454
00:26:06,868 --> 00:26:08,653
[child babbles]

455
00:26:08,827 --> 00:26:11,307
[Seth]
I know. I'm a rock star.

456
00:26:11,481 --> 00:26:13,441
Um, so we'll just do
a large cheese pizza.

457
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:14,876
That should be enough,
yeah?

458
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:16,530
Oh, do you want to do
the appetizer trio, too?

459
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:18,837
We'll do the appetizer trio
as well.

460
00:26:19,011 --> 00:26:20,186
Brittany.

461
00:26:20,361 --> 00:26:21,840
You want to go see Daddy
by the flowers?

462
00:26:22,015 --> 00:26:23,406
Go see Daddy by the flowers?
[Brittany chuckles]

463
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:26,105
- Go! Go, go, go, go, go!
- Oh, my God.

464
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:27,367
Oh, you're in
our runners' group.

465
00:26:27,541 --> 00:26:29,935
Yeah.
Did you run the 5K?

466
00:26:30,109 --> 00:26:32,721
- Hey, that's great.
- You should join us.

467
00:26:32,894 --> 00:26:34,417
Oh, she has kids.
It's a Saturday.

468
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,463
Oh, no, they're at
their dad's this weekend.

469
00:26:36,637 --> 00:26:39,205
Oh, I didn't... I didn't
know you were divorced.

470
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:42,077
Soon. That's why I'm
crashing at the studio.

471
00:26:42,251 --> 00:26:43,818
I'm a photographer,

472
00:26:43,992 --> 00:26:45,691
and I've got the apartment
right above Brittany's.

473
00:26:45,865 --> 00:26:47,257
Oh, smell you.

474
00:26:47,431 --> 00:26:49,477
Wait, so you know this
much-talked-about Gretchen.

475
00:26:49,651 --> 00:26:52,045
I thought she was gonna be
at the finish line.

476
00:26:52,219 --> 00:26:53,741
She had a late night.

477
00:26:53,915 --> 00:26:55,439
Oh, I wanted to meet
your best friend.

478
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:58,050
[chuckles] It's not
the end of the world.

479
00:26:58,224 --> 00:26:59,355
[tapping keys]

480
00:26:59,529 --> 00:27:01,270
Oof. [sighs]

481
00:27:02,271 --> 00:27:04,665
Jesus Christ, is that me?

482
00:27:08,713 --> 00:27:09,845
- [door opens]
- [Gretchen] Brittany.

483
00:27:10,019 --> 00:27:11,759
Oh, my God,
Terrence is in Boston.

484
00:27:11,933 --> 00:27:13,893
- Let's go out.
- Oh, I-I can't.

485
00:27:14,067 --> 00:27:15,676
I got a runners' group
in the morn.

486
00:27:15,851 --> 00:27:17,243
Come on.

487
00:27:17,417 --> 00:27:22,596
Hey, don't you deserve
a little bit of fun?

488
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:24,946
[singsongy]
Just a little Addy.

489
00:27:25,121 --> 00:27:27,210
[dance music pulsing]

490
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:30,692
[retching]

491
00:27:30,865 --> 00:27:32,606
[spits]

492
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:37,351
[spits]

493
00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:41,268
[groans]

494
00:27:47,883 --> 00:27:49,711
[exhales]

495
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,628
I wanted to go to your thing
this morning,

496
00:27:54,802 --> 00:27:58,414
but there was an Ace of Base
cover band at Vintage last night,

497
00:27:58,588 --> 00:28:00,853
and they didn't go on
until, like, 2:00 a.m.

498
00:28:01,027 --> 00:28:03,115
It's fine.
You don't need to come to those.

499
00:28:03,289 --> 00:28:04,900
"Those"?

500
00:28:05,074 --> 00:28:07,729
You are so cute
with this whole running thing.

501
00:28:07,903 --> 00:28:10,644
- I'm a runner now.
- Me, too.

502
00:28:10,818 --> 00:28:12,907
I mean, we've all got legs.

503
00:28:13,082 --> 00:28:14,823
We're all in a hurry sometimes.

504
00:28:14,997 --> 00:28:18,260
We're all runners when we
need to be, right? [chuckles]

505
00:28:18,434 --> 00:28:20,175
[Seth]
A marathon?

506
00:28:20,349 --> 00:28:22,788
We don't have to win it.
We just have to finish it.

507
00:28:22,961 --> 00:28:24,223
The New York City Marathon?

508
00:28:24,397 --> 00:28:26,095
I think that is
such a good idea.

509
00:28:26,269 --> 00:28:28,054
Catherine,
you're 40 times faster than us.

510
00:28:28,228 --> 00:28:31,057
- Why are you running back here?
- I like talking to you guys.

511
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:33,842
They're very, very intense at the front.
Not a lot of chitchat.

512
00:28:34,016 --> 00:28:37,192
I don't want you to feel bad for us or
something, and that's why you're back here.

513
00:28:37,366 --> 00:28:40,544
No, I don't. You know, I trained for
the marathon about four years ago.

514
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,721
But I had to quit
because I got pregnant.

515
00:28:42,894 --> 00:28:45,419
And my ex-husband's really dragging
me through the mud right now,

516
00:28:45,593 --> 00:28:47,463
so I'd really love
to do this with you guys.

517
00:28:47,637 --> 00:28:49,336
Mm-hmm. You girls have fun.
Come on.

518
00:28:49,509 --> 00:28:51,163
Don't you want to
accomplish something epic?

519
00:28:51,337 --> 00:28:53,992
Or be taken seriously and
change how people look at you?

520
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:58,171
I don't need to pee myself on
a 26.2-mile race to feel proud.

521
00:28:58,345 --> 00:29:00,607
Literally no one knows
what you're talking about.

522
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:03,567
People get so tired,
they piss themselves during it.

523
00:29:03,741 --> 00:29:05,221
No, they don't.
[laughing]

524
00:29:05,394 --> 00:29:07,135
Yes. Yes.
That's disgusting.

525
00:29:07,309 --> 00:29:10,487
When my cousin ran it,
she shat her pants,

526
00:29:10,661 --> 00:29:13,142
came back to her apartment
for the party we threw for her,

527
00:29:13,316 --> 00:29:16,102
and had to kick everyone out
so she could clean herself.

528
00:29:16,276 --> 00:29:20,366
I have a child, hopes for another.
It's all I need in life.

529
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:23,021
Tons of people
don't shooot themselves.

530
00:29:23,195 --> 00:29:25,414
You ever think of that?
Okay, listen.

531
00:29:25,588 --> 00:29:26,807
Marathon's next November.

532
00:29:26,981 --> 00:29:28,679
That gives us
less than a year to train.

533
00:29:28,854 --> 00:29:30,420
Brittany and I
will run the marathon.

534
00:29:30,594 --> 00:29:32,074
Seth, you stay home,
you eat ice cream,

535
00:29:32,248 --> 00:29:33,683
and you just look
at pictures on Facebook

536
00:29:33,858 --> 00:29:35,903
of the two of us at the finish line.
How's that?

537
00:29:36,077 --> 00:29:39,342
While your husband and son pick out
mountain bikes after his football practice.

538
00:29:40,343 --> 00:29:41,953
You bitch.
[Catherine, Brittany laugh]

539
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:45,695
[groaning]
Fine.

540
00:29:45,871 --> 00:29:48,351
We'll never actually do it,
but fine.

541
00:29:48,525 --> 00:29:50,483
- Yes!
- [whoops]

542
00:29:50,657 --> 00:29:52,486
[Catherine] You know,
a lot of people fail at this,

543
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,792
but, guys,
I have faith in this group.

544
00:29:54,967 --> 00:29:57,925
[siren wailing] [Seth] Hmm.
That's a bad omen.

545
00:29:58,099 --> 00:30:01,190
Okay, so I'm guaranteed a slot because
I joined a marathon group a while ago,

546
00:30:01,364 --> 00:30:04,585
but for you two to get a slot,
you have to join the lottery.

547
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:06,934
Oh, I love lotteries.

548
00:30:07,108 --> 00:30:08,067
Yeah, but if you don't win,
then you got to raise money for a charity,

549
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,373
and then they get you
a slot.

550
00:30:10,547 --> 00:30:12,767
And we should probably join a gym
so we can do some cross-training.

551
00:30:12,941 --> 00:30:14,073
Whoa, wait, excuse me.

552
00:30:14,247 --> 00:30:16,117
What?
Uh, ka-ching. [chuckles]

553
00:30:16,291 --> 00:30:18,598
'Cause all that costs a lot of money.
Can we do it on a shoestring?

554
00:30:18,772 --> 00:30:20,426
Well, even the lottery
costs money.

555
00:30:20,601 --> 00:30:23,778
I'm fine with skipping all
this, if it's too much for you.

556
00:30:42,797 --> 00:30:45,191
[subway train squealing]
Hold it!

557
00:30:45,365 --> 00:30:47,410
[panting]

558
00:30:54,461 --> 00:30:56,375
Okay.
Debbie's down for her nap.

559
00:30:56,549 --> 00:30:58,813
Oh, "Debbie Does Napping."

560
00:30:58,987 --> 00:31:00,902
It's a reference.

561
00:31:01,076 --> 00:31:03,209
It's fine. Um...
Oh.

562
00:31:03,383 --> 00:31:05,951
I'm so happy we could sit down and
talk about this nanny position.

563
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:07,256
Yeah.
I'm psyched.

564
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:08,866
Uh, so this would be
the room.

565
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,519
Oh, this is the room?
Yeah.

566
00:31:10,693 --> 00:31:13,174
And this would be your bed.

567
00:31:13,348 --> 00:31:16,221
Oh. Look at that surprise.

568
00:31:16,395 --> 00:31:18,920
Your résumé
is really impressive.

569
00:31:19,094 --> 00:31:21,575
Yeah, people rag on Cornell,
but it's still an Ivy, right?

570
00:31:21,749 --> 00:31:23,619
- You majored in education.
- Anyway...

571
00:31:23,794 --> 00:31:25,535
And you babysat
for the Bidens.

572
00:31:25,709 --> 00:31:28,756
Uh, listen, I love kids
and thinking of fun projects,

573
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:31,411
and I actually kind of flourish
in chaotic atmospheres,

574
00:31:31,585 --> 00:31:33,281
so this is, like...
[clicks tongue]

575
00:31:33,455 --> 00:31:35,849
I just... I have a couple
little questions.

576
00:31:36,023 --> 00:31:37,155
Oh, yeah. Shoot.

577
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:39,767
I would love you
to walk me through...

578
00:31:39,941 --> 00:31:44,467
uh, the age-appropriate CPR
for this doll.

579
00:31:50,038 --> 00:31:53,085
Okay. Let's do that now.

580
00:31:54,215 --> 00:31:57,088
The first step
is to obviously...

581
00:31:57,262 --> 00:32:00,048
check to see if the child
is breathing.

582
00:32:00,221 --> 00:32:02,921
Mm-hmm.
Yeah. So...

583
00:32:05,662 --> 00:32:06,968
[chuckles awkwardly]

584
00:32:07,142 --> 00:32:09,710
Ooh, I'm sorry,
this child is dead.

585
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:12,973
[both laughing]
I know it's...

586
00:32:13,147 --> 00:32:14,758
Oh, my God.
It's 'cause the doll.

587
00:32:14,932 --> 00:32:16,673
God, you are hilarious.
[laughs]

588
00:32:16,846 --> 00:32:17,935
[grunting playfully]

589
00:32:18,109 --> 00:32:19,153
Oh, my God.

590
00:32:20,547 --> 00:32:24,550
You have a great personality,
which I love,

591
00:32:24,724 --> 00:32:28,076
but to be honest,
my husband's kind of looking for a nanny

592
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:30,296
who will fade
into the background.

593
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:32,776
Thank you so much
for coming, though.

594
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,604
Can I get you a bottle
of water for the...

595
00:32:34,778 --> 00:32:37,564
I'm just fading in the background.
Oh, that's so funny. Yeah.

596
00:32:37,738 --> 00:32:40,567
[sighs]
I'm so sorry.

597
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,176
[clears throat]
No, it's fine.

598
00:32:42,351 --> 00:32:44,527
It's just, I keep
interviewing at places,

599
00:32:44,701 --> 00:32:48,227
and no one thinks
I'm the right fit.

600
00:32:48,401 --> 00:32:53,623
Except for dive bars, and I'm sort
of trying to stay out of that scene.

601
00:32:53,797 --> 00:32:57,410
Oh, my goodness.
Who is this gentleman?

602
00:32:57,584 --> 00:32:59,541
Oh, this is a foster.

603
00:32:59,715 --> 00:33:02,501
Ooh, someone's gonna come along
and love you. I just know it.

604
00:33:02,675 --> 00:33:05,634
You know, if you like animals,
I should refer you to my sister.

605
00:33:05,808 --> 00:33:07,071
Is she a dog?

606
00:33:07,246 --> 00:33:09,726
Uh, no, no, she, um...
she owns a company.

607
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,990
They do house-sitting
and pet-sitting.

608
00:33:12,163 --> 00:33:16,732
If a homeowner is out of town for a
while and they can't take their pet,

609
00:33:16,906 --> 00:33:20,432
they hire people to be around
for 100 bucks a day.

610
00:33:25,307 --> 00:33:27,134
Oh, my goodness.

611
00:33:27,308 --> 00:33:29,397
You must be Milo.

612
00:33:29,571 --> 00:33:32,880
Oh.
[panting]

613
00:33:38,493 --> 00:33:41,061
[chuckling]
Oh, my goodness.

[man]
What the hell?

Bad taste in music.

You the new girl?
I'm the nighttime guy, Jern.

"Jairm"? Like "Jeremy"?
Hello, Milo.

637
00:34:54,744 --> 00:34:56,702
Mwah.
No, it's Jern.

638
00:34:56,876 --> 00:34:58,791
I didn't know
there was a nighttime guy.

639
00:34:58,965 --> 00:35:01,621
I'm sorry. What are you doing
here in the middle of the day?

640
00:35:01,795 --> 00:35:04,101
Oh. I moved in.

641
00:35:05,972 --> 00:35:08,628
[music playing]

642
00:35:08,802 --> 00:35:10,760
- Hey.
- Yo.

643
00:35:10,934 --> 00:35:13,458
You're living here, yeah?

644
00:35:13,632 --> 00:35:14,981
I sleep here
for the gig anyway,

645
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:18,072
so now I just chill here
during the day, too.

646
00:35:18,246 --> 00:35:22,728
You just kind of put me in a weird
position, 'cause I have to report this.

647
00:35:22,902 --> 00:35:24,686
Like, contractually,
I have to.

648
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:27,036
[chuckles]
Oh. Okay.

649
00:35:27,211 --> 00:35:28,777
Yeah.

650
00:35:28,952 --> 00:35:33,043
But wouldn't it be shitty
if they told the owner,

651
00:35:33,217 --> 00:35:36,873
and then he canceled
the service altogether?

652
00:35:37,047 --> 00:35:38,266
That would suck.

653
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,398
I mean, I'd get fired,
yeah,

654
00:35:40,572 --> 00:35:43,228
but who knows when another
opening would come around for you?

655
00:35:43,402 --> 00:35:45,447
Is this what you do
full-time, then?

656
00:35:45,621 --> 00:35:47,056
[burps]
Oh, flap.

657
00:35:47,231 --> 00:35:48,494
How old are you?

658
00:35:48,668 --> 00:35:50,626
Thirty, 35.
Somewhere in there.

659
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,193
Doesn't matter.
You know what?

660
00:35:52,367 --> 00:35:54,891
Stop asking me questions,
all right?

661
00:35:55,065 --> 00:35:56,762
My life is dope.

662
00:35:56,936 --> 00:35:59,460
Look at my house.
I live in a flaping mansion.

663
00:36:07,338 --> 00:36:09,036
Where'd you get that?

664
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:10,516
The mailbox.

665
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:14,041
I hate him.
Like, I very much hate him.

666
00:36:14,215 --> 00:36:16,260
You're gonna have sex
with him.

667
00:36:16,434 --> 00:36:19,393
- What?
- You're gonna have sex with him.

668
00:36:19,568 --> 00:36:23,005
Trust me, any tension
is sexual tension.

669
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:26,706
Once I figured that out,
I got along way better with my uncle.

670
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:31,188
Joke.

671
00:36:31,362 --> 00:36:32,885
[chuckles]

672
00:36:35,322 --> 00:36:41,286
When I'm with him, I have this crazy
urge to eat cake, cookies, candy.

673
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:46,420
Just let that sexual tension propel
you while the three of us train.

674
00:36:46,594 --> 00:36:49,467
What if we made it
just the two of us?

675
00:36:51,077 --> 00:36:55,909
Look, I know Catherine's athleticism
and intensity is intimidating,

676
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:59,608
but she's getting a divorce, and she needs
something to channel her energy into.

677
00:36:59,782 --> 00:37:02,175
[Brittany] I just hate when
people, like, pity me.

678
00:37:02,349 --> 00:37:07,050
Cut her some slack.
She only sees her kids two days a week.

679
00:37:07,224 --> 00:37:08,487
She's got maternal energy
to spare.

680
00:37:08,661 --> 00:37:10,184
[Brittany]
I just don't need a coach.

681
00:37:10,358 --> 00:37:12,751
And I definitely don't need her
to, like, be my mom.

682
00:37:12,925 --> 00:37:14,101
[Seth]
Brittany, come on.

683
00:37:14,275 --> 00:37:16,494
She's trying.

684
00:37:16,668 --> 00:37:18,844
It's hard
to start a new life.

685
00:38:07,545 --> 00:38:09,199
[laughter, lively chatter]

686
00:38:09,373 --> 00:38:10,983
Morning.

687
00:38:13,552 --> 00:38:17,251
[announcer on TV] Flashback Friday
continues right now with moreDoug.

688
00:38:17,425 --> 00:38:18,773
I have a fun question.

689
00:38:18,947 --> 00:38:21,168
Do you ever actually work
at this job?

690
00:38:21,342 --> 00:38:22,777
Do you like Doug?

691
00:38:22,952 --> 00:38:25,867
I've been here for weeks,
and you haven't checked

692
00:38:26,041 --> 00:38:28,217
one thing off
the homeowner's task list.

693
00:38:28,393 --> 00:38:30,090
I got my first boners
'cause of Patti.

694
00:38:30,264 --> 00:38:32,701
Jesus. Yeah, I know.
It gets weirder.

695
00:38:32,875 --> 00:38:34,398
I'd be lying down
with my stepmom,

696
00:38:34,572 --> 00:38:36,139
we'd be all cuddled up
on the couch,

697
00:38:36,313 --> 00:38:38,706
and then Patti Mayonnaise
would come on TV,

698
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,014
and I got busted
'cause that blanket would move.

699
00:38:42,188 --> 00:38:44,190
It'd be like...
[makes whooshing sound]

700
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:47,063
Oh, it would move 'cause you
got a boner for Patti? [laughs]

701
00:38:47,237 --> 00:38:48,804
Exactly.

702
00:38:48,978 --> 00:38:50,806
Way to brag about your dick size
while watching cartoons.

703
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,851
[turns off TV]
Why... Goddamn it.

704
00:38:53,025 --> 00:38:55,637
You know what?
Cartoons are fun.

705
00:38:55,811 --> 00:38:57,900
And they're colorful
and vibrant,

706
00:38:58,074 --> 00:39:00,686
and they help people actually
get through real-life shooot.

707
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,208
Did you know that?

708
00:39:02,382 --> 00:39:03,949
Because when my parents
got divorced, Doug...

709
00:39:04,123 --> 00:39:06,126
Dougis the only thing
that saved me.

710
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,563
How long ago was that?
All right, listen.

711
00:39:08,737 --> 00:39:11,652
Divorce sends shock waves
through a young man's life,

712
00:39:11,827 --> 00:39:15,744
a-and I need certain considerations
taken for my particular circumstances.

713
00:39:15,918 --> 00:39:18,137
Oh, I'm so sorry.

714
00:39:18,311 --> 00:39:20,922
I didn't think about the fact that you're
the only person this has ever happened to.

715
00:39:21,097 --> 00:39:22,228
My bad.

716
00:39:22,402 --> 00:39:24,579
Oh, shooot. Your dad cheated? No.

717
00:39:24,753 --> 00:39:27,233
- My dad did not cheat.
- Oh, my God. Your mom?

718
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:29,148
I don't ask you
personal questions,

719
00:39:29,322 --> 00:39:31,847
like why the flap
your parents named you Jern.

720
00:39:32,021 --> 00:39:33,414
That's racist.

721
00:39:33,588 --> 00:39:35,416
Is Jern an Indian name?

722
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:36,677
I mean, I don't even know.
Could be.

723
00:39:36,851 --> 00:39:38,724
flap you, man.

724
00:39:38,898 --> 00:39:41,682
So your dad doesn't cheat on your
mom, but he definitely leaves her.

725
00:39:41,856 --> 00:39:44,599
And then she...
remarries, right?

726
00:39:44,773 --> 00:39:47,079
Yeah, yeah,
she remarries that dude

727
00:39:47,253 --> 00:39:49,081
that you keep Skyping with all
the time... What's his name?

728
00:39:49,255 --> 00:39:50,648
It's like Desmond
or something, right?

729
00:39:50,822 --> 00:39:53,128
- Demetrius?
- I was close.

730
00:39:53,302 --> 00:39:56,219
He's my sister's husband.
He's basically like my stepdad.

731
00:39:56,393 --> 00:39:58,483
Okay. How does that work?

732
00:39:59,266 --> 00:40:01,181
I...

733
00:40:01,355 --> 00:40:03,009
I don't... [sighs]

734
00:40:03,182 --> 00:40:05,010
Oh, come on.
Don't get...

735
00:40:05,184 --> 00:40:07,534
Okay. Let's make a deal.
All right?

736
00:40:07,708 --> 00:40:09,755
'Cause I need that
juicy, juicy info

737
00:40:09,929 --> 00:40:11,409
that's hidden deep
in your soul,

738
00:40:11,583 --> 00:40:15,717
and you need me to
take out the trash.

739
00:40:15,891 --> 00:40:19,938
Huh? And also clean out,
uh, sections of the fridge.

740
00:40:20,112 --> 00:40:21,201
The whole fridge.

741
00:40:21,375 --> 00:40:24,072
Okay. For you, yes, let's do it.

742
00:40:24,246 --> 00:40:25,639
Okay.

743
00:40:25,813 --> 00:40:29,077
Um, my mom wanted
to be an actress.

744
00:40:29,251 --> 00:40:31,864
She couldn't do that in Philly,
so she left.

745
00:40:32,038 --> 00:40:35,170
My dad got really depressed,
gave up on everything.

746
00:40:35,344 --> 00:40:37,130
A few years later,
he died.

747
00:40:37,304 --> 00:40:39,567
My sister was studying
to become a nurse,

748
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:44,050
so Demetrius and her...
moved in,

749
00:40:44,224 --> 00:40:46,007
and he basically raised me,

750
00:40:46,181 --> 00:40:51,273
which is awesome
because he himself is awesome.

751
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,275
Yeah,
that sounds awesome.

752
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,800
That sounds like
a Norman Rockwell panting.

753
00:40:55,974 --> 00:40:58,150
I mean,
just totally normal.

754
00:40:58,324 --> 00:41:01,153
- Jern...
- My dad fell in love with another woman.

755
00:41:01,327 --> 00:41:04,244
At least that's how they explained
it to me when I was a kid.

756
00:41:04,418 --> 00:41:06,159
But that's
probably bullshit, right?

757
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:08,117
I bet she just caught him
banging somebody,

758
00:41:08,291 --> 00:41:10,380
and then
we had to sell our house.

759
00:41:10,554 --> 00:41:13,079
That sucks.

760
00:41:13,253 --> 00:41:15,690
What are you doing?

761
00:41:18,693 --> 00:41:21,434
I'll throw that shooot out after
I'm done with this episode.

762
00:41:21,608 --> 00:41:23,697
Jern, grow up.

763
00:41:23,871 --> 00:41:26,135
Oh, my God, girl.
Holy shooot.

764
00:41:26,309 --> 00:41:30,139
Drake, third row.
It was, like, so flaping good.

765
00:41:30,313 --> 00:41:32,619
I was, like, almost
making eye contact with him,

766
00:41:32,793 --> 00:41:34,403
and I was like,
"I don't know." He's...

767
00:41:34,579 --> 00:41:37,451
[laughs] I almost barfed
on the train, girl.

768
00:41:37,625 --> 00:41:40,454
[pop music playing]

769
00:42:03,608 --> 00:42:05,914
[subway train screeching]

770
00:42:06,088 --> 00:42:08,047
[bell chiming]
Hold it! Hold it!

771
00:42:10,963 --> 00:42:13,052
[man] Miss?
Oh.

772
00:42:15,445 --> 00:42:17,534
God. Thank you so much.

773
00:42:20,494 --> 00:42:22,277
[bell chimes]

774
00:42:22,452 --> 00:42:24,106
David's picking me up.
Our two-year anniversary. Ah.

775
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,195
He's taking me to this
Mexican restaurant in Brooklyn

776
00:42:26,369 --> 00:42:28,762
where they make this guac
with sunflower seeds.

777
00:42:28,936 --> 00:42:32,288
Ooh, that'll either be
really good or terrible.

778
00:42:32,461 --> 00:42:35,161
Hey, babe.
Hey.

779
00:42:35,335 --> 00:42:36,641
I'm David.

780
00:42:36,815 --> 00:42:38,730
Yeah. I'm Brittany.

781
00:42:38,903 --> 00:42:40,862
Been working here six years.
[laughs]

782
00:42:41,036 --> 00:42:42,559
Brittany?

783
00:42:42,733 --> 00:42:44,083
You look great.

784
00:42:44,257 --> 00:42:46,519
You're like
a whole new person.

785
00:42:46,693 --> 00:42:48,608
[British accent] I'm
trainin' for the marathon.

786
00:42:48,782 --> 00:42:52,438
- Many will try.
Few will succeed. -[chuckles]

787
00:42:52,612 --> 00:42:54,833
Okay, babe, let's do this. Yeah.

788
00:42:55,007 --> 00:42:57,009
Who's the, uh,
lucky guy tonight?

789
00:42:57,182 --> 00:43:00,447
Well, you're not going home
alone looking like that, are you?

790
00:43:00,621 --> 00:43:02,666
[Shannon]
David.

791
00:43:07,802 --> 00:43:09,760
[typing]

792
00:43:19,074 --> 00:43:21,293
Yo, girl.

793
00:43:25,253 --> 00:43:26,952
Hey.

794
00:43:27,126 --> 00:43:29,911
It's Tuesday. Why aren't you
snoozing at Terrence's?

795
00:43:32,086 --> 00:43:34,916
Um, we broke up.

796
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:36,438
When?

797
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,789
Last week.
I posted about it.

798
00:43:38,963 --> 00:43:41,967
I haven't been on.

799
00:43:42,141 --> 00:43:44,447
Why didn't you tell me?
Are you okay?

800
00:43:44,621 --> 00:43:46,492
Yeah, I'm fine.
It's just...

801
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:50,148
You know, I just watched, like,
I don't even know, 22 YouTube videos

802
00:43:50,322 --> 00:43:52,150
by this girl
who's, like, 4'11",

803
00:43:52,324 --> 00:43:54,282
and she has
a full-blown lazy eye,

804
00:43:54,456 --> 00:43:56,155
and she has sponsorship deals.

805
00:43:56,329 --> 00:43:57,809
I mean, like...

806
00:43:57,983 --> 00:44:00,811
I'm just confused and annoyed.

807
00:44:00,985 --> 00:44:03,771
What a slut.
We hate her.

808
00:44:03,945 --> 00:44:06,425
Is being annoyed
stupid of me?

809
00:44:07,253 --> 00:44:08,427
[chuckles quietly]

810
00:44:10,081 --> 00:44:11,605
Hey, want to get a drink?

811
00:44:11,778 --> 00:44:14,521
What do you want?
Tequila? Beer? [chuckles]

812
00:44:14,695 --> 00:44:16,304
Whatever you want.

813
00:44:16,478 --> 00:44:18,612
I mean, I-I can't drink.

814
00:44:18,786 --> 00:44:20,309
Okay, what about ice cream?

815
00:44:20,483 --> 00:44:25,139
This is your night,
so you... you pick what you want.

816
00:44:25,313 --> 00:44:29,971
Okay, but I want to know
what sounds good to you.

817
00:44:33,931 --> 00:44:36,760
[scoffs] Okay. Well...

818
00:44:44,072 --> 00:44:45,813
I'm sorry.

819
00:44:45,987 --> 00:44:48,773
I'm just... busy now.

820
00:44:48,947 --> 00:44:50,688
I'm working two jobs.

821
00:44:50,862 --> 00:44:53,516
I'm exhausted.

822
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:55,996
I've lost 34 pounds.

823
00:44:57,041 --> 00:44:59,130
Okay.

824
00:45:01,873 --> 00:45:04,789
It's a big deal.

825
00:45:04,963 --> 00:45:07,181
I'm just trying
to get my life in order.

826
00:45:07,356 --> 00:45:09,532
Are you saying that
my life is not in order?

827
00:45:09,706 --> 00:45:10,969
No.

828
00:45:11,143 --> 00:45:12,447
Because I'm
a teacher's assistant

829
00:45:12,621 --> 00:45:14,536
for deaf, gifted kids
on the Lower East Side.

830
00:45:14,711 --> 00:45:16,539
You're incredible.
I just...

831
00:45:17,496 --> 00:45:18,759
I just mean, like...

832
00:45:19,934 --> 00:45:23,764
the weeknight drinking
is hard for me.

833
00:45:23,938 --> 00:45:27,027
- You're calling me an alcoholic now?
- No.

834
00:45:27,202 --> 00:45:29,335
Because you're the only one
with the problem around here.

835
00:45:29,509 --> 00:45:32,467
- Problems, plural.
- Oh, that's mean.

836
00:45:32,641 --> 00:45:35,297
You're flaping mean,
Brittany.

837
00:45:35,471 --> 00:45:37,342
Don't come in here
and judge me.

838
00:45:37,516 --> 00:45:40,693
I have never judged you, and trust
me, there was a lot to judge.

839
00:45:40,867 --> 00:45:43,740
Wow. We're on the same page that
right now you are judging me, right?

840
00:45:43,914 --> 00:45:47,527
You know what, just go take a
run with your loser friends.

841
00:45:47,701 --> 00:45:51,661
- [amplified heartbeat thumping]
- [panting quietly]

842
00:45:56,623 --> 00:45:58,755
You're a loser.

843
00:45:58,929 --> 00:46:01,715
I make fun of people like you who spend
all day humble-bragging on Instagram.

844
00:46:01,889 --> 00:46:03,717
Okay, I'm not humble-bragging.
That's my life.

845
00:46:03,891 --> 00:46:06,327
I'm sorry no one
likes your life.

846
00:46:06,501 --> 00:46:08,416
Those people don't know you.

847
00:46:08,590 --> 00:46:10,592

01:03:32,373 --> 01:03:35,072
Very real, very serious,

1191
01:03:35,246 --> 01:03:38,074
athletic,
marathon-training runners.

1192
01:03:38,248 --> 01:03:39,815
Bye.

1193
01:03:41,947 --> 01:03:43,601
What was that about?

1194
01:03:49,347 --> 01:03:50,695
[cell phone vibrates]

1195
01:03:50,869 --> 01:03:52,306
Hey.

1196
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:55,614
I got a spot... the lottery.

1197
01:03:55,788 --> 01:03:57,789
Oh, my God,
I'm running to my computer.

1198
01:04:08,496 --> 01:04:10,628
Seth, I'm so happy for you.

1199
01:04:10,802 --> 01:04:11,978
Oh, no.

1200
01:04:12,152 --> 01:04:13,980
Yeah, I didn't get one.

1201
01:04:14,153 --> 01:04:15,721
But it's okay.

1202
01:04:15,894 --> 01:04:18,376
I just have to raise money
for a charity now.

1203
01:04:18,550 --> 01:04:20,291
Totally doable.
[chuckles]

1204
01:04:20,465 --> 01:04:24,382
I mean, I can't save money for
myself, but I'll figure it out.

1205
01:04:24,556 --> 01:04:26,079
shooot.

1206

Let's talk about it at
Catherine's housewarming party.

1207
01:04:28,385 --> 01:04:30,300
She found a great place
with room for her kids.

1208
01:04:30,474 --> 01:04:33,565
We're gonna go and support her,
and I'm gonna help you.

1209
01:04:35,262 --> 01:04:37,090
Wh-Why would you want
to do that?

1210
01:04:37,264 --> 01:04:39,876
[chuckling] Because I'm your
friend, Brittany.

1211
01:04:42,094 --> 01:04:44,271
[man] Did you see Rodrigo's
fire installation?

1212
01:04:44,445 --> 01:04:47,579
[Catherine] Uh, Tina saw
it, and she liked it.

1213
01:04:47,753 --> 01:04:49,797
Really?
Yeah. Believe so.

1214
01:04:49,972 --> 01:04:52,235
What'd you think?
[sighs]

1215
01:04:52,409 --> 01:04:54,934
I found
the whole showing cold.

1216
01:04:55,108 --> 01:04:56,456
Very cold.

1217
01:04:56,630 --> 01:04:58,284
And in no way subversive;
very literal.

1218
01:04:58,458 --> 01:05:00,244
Oh, you guys are talking
about The Walking Dead?

1219
01:05:00,418 --> 01:05:01,505
Very literal.

1220
01:05:01,679 --> 01:05:03,594
This is...
This is Brittany.

1221
01:05:03,768 --> 01:05:05,813
I have the studio
above her apartment.

1222
01:05:05,989 --> 01:05:08,121
And we're training
for the marathon together.

1223
01:05:08,295 --> 01:05:10,123
[Brittany chuckles]

1224
01:05:10,297 --> 01:05:12,820
Uh... okay.

1225
01:05:12,996 --> 01:05:14,387
[both chuckle awkwardly]

1226
01:05:14,561 --> 01:05:16,869
I'm gonna get another job.
[Seth] What?

1227
01:05:17,043 --> 01:05:19,653
You're stretched thinner
than a Listerine strip.

1228
01:05:19,827 --> 01:05:21,481
[laughter]
Just tell her.

1229
01:05:21,655 --> 01:05:23,789
Okay.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1230
01:05:24,789 --> 01:05:28,402
So, my family
has this trust,

1231
01:05:28,576 --> 01:05:31,362
and every year,
I get to make a donation

1232
01:05:31,536 --> 01:05:33,885
to an organization
that I pick.

1233
01:05:34,059 --> 01:05:36,932
So, Seth wanted to pitch in,

1234
01:05:37,106 --> 01:05:41,110
because we wouldn't even be running
this marathon if it wasn't for you.

1235
01:05:50,076 --> 01:05:52,773
You really inspired us,
Britt.

1236
01:05:54,210 --> 01:05:56,648
You're gonna do it.

1237
01:05:56,822 --> 01:05:59,128
You're gonna
run the marathon.

1238
01:06:00,478 --> 01:06:02,219
[scoffs quietly]

1239
01:06:07,179 --> 01:06:10,748
This money should be going
to something you care about.

1240
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:13,143
It is.

1241
01:06:14,753 --> 01:06:16,536
[laughing]
Okay.

1242
01:06:16,710 --> 01:06:19,670
I don't need you to, like,
force your way into my life

1243
01:06:19,844 --> 01:06:22,282
and give me pep talks
and checks.

1244
01:06:22,456 --> 01:06:23,891
I don't need your pity.

1245
01:06:24,067 --> 01:06:25,545
[Seth]
We're just trying to help.

1246
01:06:25,719 --> 01:06:27,635
[Brittany]
I don't need that.

1247
01:06:27,809 --> 01:06:29,855
I can do this on my own.

1248
01:06:32,335 --> 01:06:34,206
Do you know what time it is?

1249
01:06:34,380 --> 01:06:37,253
I forgot, I...
I have to go to something.

1250
01:06:37,427 --> 01:06:39,907
[Seth] I thought we were
gonna get dinner with Jern.

1251
01:06:40,083 --> 01:06:42,389
I told Peter we were gonna
meet your boyfriend.

1252
01:06:42,563 --> 01:06:44,260
He's not
my flaping boyfriend.

1253
01:06:44,434 --> 01:06:46,262
Don't know why
you keep saying that.

1254
01:06:46,436 --> 01:06:49,614

I'll see you tomorrow.

Where are your friends?

01:06:58,056 --> 01:07:00,277
Uh, something happened
with their kid.

1259
01:07:00,451 --> 01:07:02,018
Parents.

1260
01:07:02,192 --> 01:07:03,235
[groans]
Yeah.

1261
01:07:03,409 --> 01:07:04,715
All right, well,
I'm always happy

1262
01:07:04,889 --> 01:07:06,804
when it's just
the two of us anyway.

1263
01:07:08,545 --> 01:07:10,764
We're just having sex,
right?

1264
01:07:10,938 --> 01:07:12,766
I mean, we're not dating.

1265
01:07:12,940 --> 01:07:16,206
Uh-uh, no, uh... We don't
have to define anything.

1266
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:17,380
Right.

1267
01:07:17,554 --> 01:07:19,121
Okay, so we're not.

1268
01:07:19,295 --> 01:07:20,731
I could never date you.

1269

[Brittany chuckles]

1270
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:25,563
Okay, then.

1271
01:07:25,737 --> 01:07:27,652
Thank you.
What do you want to eat?

1272
01:07:27,826 --> 01:07:29,436
Chips and salsa
are just fine, so...

1273

You're giving me sympathy?
It's that bad?

Okay.
Uh, from overuse.

Next time, you got to pay
attention to your pain. Sure. Fine.

01:09:46,791 --> 01:09:49,010
What do I have to do to make
sure I can run the marathon?

1294
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:51,448
It's in five weeks.
I'm sorry.

1295
01:09:51,622 --> 01:09:53,841
You're gonna have to stay off
your foot for eight weeks.

Maybe more, depending.

How am I supposed
to run the marathon?

Well, in six weeks, you'll come
back, and we'll see what's next.

Hey, everything's
gonna be fine.

I was trying
to turn my life around.

And now you'll be the man

by running
the New York City Marathon,

1311
01:10:32,140 --> 01:10:36,622
and Catherine will be the woman who got out of
a bad marriage and ran a freaking marathon,

1312
01:10:36,796 --> 01:10:40,931
and I'm gonna be a girl who was stupid enough
to think she could turn her life around

1313
01:10:41,105 --> 01:10:43,326
and instead needed
a flaping seat belt extender

1314

How about a girl who weighs
50 pounds more than me, Jern?

1325

Because guess what... the pounds
are coming back from vacation.

Who withdrew my college application
to make sure you were okay,

1504
01:20:10,849 --> 01:20:12,807
because I wanted to help
make up for your mom.

1505
01:20:12,981 --> 01:20:15,984
And after all that, you still just
want to get through life alone.

fix that?

I'm embarrassed.

1510
01:20:24,731 --> 01:20:25,820
So, because you're embarrassed,
you're just gonna be an island?

1511
01:20:25,994 --> 01:20:28,127
That's your solution?

1512
01:20:28,301 --> 01:20:30,912
When your mom left your dad,
he was humiliated.

1513
01:20:31,087 --> 01:20:32,479
He was a puddle.

1514
01:20:32,653 --> 01:20:34,306
But you stroked his hair,

1515
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:36,265
and you put paper towels
on your head

1516
01:20:36,439 --> 01:20:38,789
and danced around him
and made him laugh.

1517
01:20:38,963 --> 01:20:43,229
And every day, you'd wake up and do something
just like that 'cause you knew he needed you.

1518
01:20:43,403 --> 01:20:46,797
Your dad found happiness
because of that.

1519
01:20:46,971 --> 01:20:52,064
And I'm not gonna lie to you... if he would've
rejected that, he would've been a damn fool.

1520
01:20:52,238 --> 01:20:54,545
I used to do that?

1521
01:20:54,719 --> 01:20:57,677

on my head and dance?

1522
01:20:57,853 --> 01:20:59,462
You still do that.

1523
01:20:59,636 --> 01:21:01,159
I'm serious. You did it on
Skype, like, three months ago.

1524

talking about it.

was never about your weight.

1527
01:21:10,865 --> 01:21:13,432
It was about you taking
responsibility for yourself.

1528
01:21:14,782 --> 01:21:15,913
I know.

1529
01:21:16,087 --> 01:21:17,742
You got to stop being mean.

1530
01:21:17,916 --> 01:21:21,224
Some people actually want
good things for you.

1531
01:21:21,398 --> 01:21:24,095
If someone wants
to support you...

1532
01:21:26,097 --> 01:21:27,926
I should let them.

1533
01:21:45,247 --> 01:21:47,032
[knocking]

1534
01:21:48,293 --> 01:21:49,729
Here you go.

1535
01:22:00,916 --> 01:22:02,699
[chimes]

1536
01:22:09,054 --> 01:22:11,882
[Jasmine]
I want to thank you for...

1537
01:22:12,056 --> 01:22:15,364
the lovely flowers
and the note.

1538
01:22:15,538 --> 01:22:18,194
But I want you
to know something.

1539
01:22:18,368 --> 01:22:20,021
I know your pain.

1540
01:22:21,587 --> 01:22:23,939
'Cause it was my pain, too.

1541
01:22:25,810 --> 01:22:29,726
I think about my body
every day.

1542
01:22:29,900 --> 01:22:32,337
I have my whole life.

1543
01:22:32,511 --> 01:22:35,863
But I decided
that even with my pain,

1544
01:22:36,037 --> 01:22:39,171
my fear, my self-judgment,

1545
01:22:39,345 --> 01:22:42,827
other people's judgments,
I wanted to be happy.

1546
01:22:43,001 --> 01:22:44,960
And I am.

1547
01:22:45,134 --> 01:22:47,787
Best wishes. Jasmine.

1548
01:23:03,064 --> 01:23:04,587
How are you guys?

1549
01:23:04,761 --> 01:23:06,632
Let's start there.
I feel like I never ask you that.

1550
01:23:06,806 --> 01:23:08,243
How are you doing?

1551
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:11,247
[Seth]
Yeah.

1552
01:23:11,421 --> 01:23:13,900
There's a lot
to catch up on.

1553
01:23:14,076 --> 01:23:15,729
Yeah.

1554
01:23:15,903 --> 01:23:18,863
I mean, you guys did it.
So proud of you.

1555
01:23:19,037 --> 01:23:21,212
Saw the pictures and...

1556
01:23:21,386 --> 01:23:22,735
We reached out.

1557
01:23:22,909 --> 01:23:24,694
I know.

1558
01:23:24,868 --> 01:23:26,871
I'm sorry.

1559
01:23:27,045 --> 01:23:31,658
I'm just, um,
really fucked-up in life.

1560
01:23:31,832 --> 01:23:33,965
So is everyone.

1561
01:23:38,274 --> 01:23:40,275
We missed you,
Brittany.

1562
01:23:51,809 --> 01:23:53,898
[knocking at door]

1563
01:24:00,382 --> 01:24:02,123
Why does it say
you relapsed?

1564
01:24:02,297 --> 01:24:04,516
I didn't.

1565
01:24:04,690 --> 01:24:06,693
But it-it says that you did.

1566
01:24:06,867 --> 01:24:10,871
Mm.
I was... doing a shoot.

1567
01:24:11,046 --> 01:24:13,265
I fell. I broke my wrist.

1568
01:24:13,439 --> 01:24:15,658
This was months before
we started running.

1569
01:24:15,832 --> 01:24:17,965
And then the doctor
prescribed me oxycodone.

1570
01:24:18,140 --> 01:24:19,706
I took it.
I didn't tell my husband,

1571
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:21,664
because he gets weird
about these things.

1572
01:24:21,838 --> 01:24:23,100
He found the bottle.

1573
01:24:23,274 --> 01:24:24,841
And he kept that
misleading trump card

1574
01:24:25,015 --> 01:24:27,845
in his back pocket
until last month.

1575
01:24:28,019 --> 01:24:30,978
You don't even have
visitation rights? No.

1576
01:24:32,457 --> 01:24:34,243
I'm just... I'm trying
really, really hard

1577
01:24:34,417 --> 01:24:36,940
to just focus on the things
that I can control,

1578
01:24:37,114 --> 01:24:38,769
so I started running a lot.

1579
01:24:38,943 --> 01:24:40,858
I stand up for myself in
mediation, but Marco's a fighter.

1580
01:24:41,032 --> 01:24:43,033
I... This divorce is,
like, killing me.

1581
01:24:43,207 --> 01:24:46,123
I mean, he pushed me out of the
house, and he's gonna keep pushing.

1582
01:24:46,297 --> 01:24:48,386
I haven't slept
in three weeks.

1583
01:24:49,823 --> 01:24:52,478
I just don't think
I can fight him anymore.

1584
01:24:52,652 --> 01:24:55,002
Your kids will never forgive
you if you give up on them.

1585
01:24:55,176 --> 01:24:56,091
I know.

1586
01:24:56,265 --> 01:24:57,483
This could take years.

1587
01:24:58,614 --> 01:25:00,225
Start with this one hearing,

1588
01:25:00,399 --> 01:25:03,488
and then you just take it
step by step.

1589
01:25:04,489 --> 01:25:06,012
Little goals.

1590
01:25:08,233 --> 01:25:09,626
Thank you.

1591
01:25:11,453 --> 01:25:13,978
Goddamn!
It's upsetting how good this is.

1592
01:25:14,152 --> 01:25:16,154
Like, it's so good.

1593
01:25:16,328 --> 01:25:20,462
I ate a dry salad for lunch to feel
okay about this. Mm. Delicious.

1594
01:25:20,636 --> 01:25:23,029
Yeah, it was, like, very dry.

1595
01:25:23,204 --> 01:25:25,207
Like, I looked like
a brontosaurus eating it.

1596
01:25:25,381 --> 01:25:27,600
You looked like a little brontosaurus?
Mm-hmm. I was like...

1597
01:25:27,774 --> 01:25:29,733
- [munches loudly]
- [making chewing noises]

1598
01:25:29,907 --> 01:25:31,256
[laughs]

1599
01:25:31,430 --> 01:25:34,868
- Care to see a dessert menu?
- Uh, uh, flap yes.

1600
01:25:35,042 --> 01:25:36,261
Yes, please.
Thank you.

1601
01:25:36,435 --> 01:25:38,306
So, I owe you an apology.
No, you don't.

1602
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:40,917
Mm-mm. No apologies.
We're all good.

1603
01:25:41,091 --> 01:25:44,617
I just think we should celebrate
a fancy advertising lady.

1604
01:25:44,791 --> 01:25:48,752
It's just a coordinator position...
basically a glorified intern.

1605
01:25:48,926 --> 01:25:51,057
But...
the office is in Tribeca.

1606
01:25:51,233 --> 01:25:52,712
Ooh.
There's room for growth.

1607
01:25:52,886 --> 01:25:55,975
And I, uh... I'll be able
to get my own place.

1608
01:25:56,150 --> 01:25:58,587
You're really doing it.
[laughing] Yeah.

1609
01:25:58,761 --> 01:26:01,765
Oh, my God, your Kickstarter
bird poncho video.

1610
01:26:01,939 --> 01:26:03,592
Oh, God, no. Why?

1611
01:26:03,766 --> 01:26:06,770
[stammers] No, I thought the
idea behind it was hilarious.

1612
01:26:06,944 --> 01:26:09,163
I sent it to
my college professor,

1613
01:26:09,337 --> 01:26:10,686
and he basically said
he doesn't think

1614
01:26:10,860 --> 01:26:12,341
somebody like me
could even get into

1615
01:26:12,515 --> 01:26:14,212
the individualized study
school at NYU,

1616
01:26:14,386 --> 01:26:17,083
which is shocking because I
literally graduated from there.

1617
01:26:17,259 --> 01:26:21,436
Yeah. Well, that's...
You know, someone still...

1618
01:26:21,610 --> 01:26:23,481
Stop. Stop.
I'll stop talking.

1619
01:26:23,655 --> 01:26:26,136
Tonight
is about celebrating.

1620
01:26:30,923 --> 01:26:34,014
This is the part where I get
nervous 'cause I have to be honest.

1621
01:26:34,189 --> 01:26:36,146
Um...

1622
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:39,411
I don't think
we should have sex anymore.

1623
01:26:39,585 --> 01:26:41,717
It's not the best thing
for me right now.

1624
01:26:41,891 --> 01:26:43,676
Okay. Yeah, I get that.

1625
01:26:44,546 --> 01:26:46,505
What if it was
more than sex?

1626
01:26:46,679 --> 01:26:49,115
Because we have, um...

1627
01:26:49,291 --> 01:26:51,422
I mean,
I think that if...

1628
01:26:51,596 --> 01:26:53,729
You... You're not making
eye contact with me.

1629
01:26:53,904 --> 01:26:55,078
I'm sorry.
Wow.

1630
01:26:55,252 --> 01:26:56,993
I try to
get my shooot together,

1631
01:26:57,167 --> 01:26:59,865
and it's just one rejection
after another.

1632
01:27:00,039 --> 01:27:01,520
I get it.
Do you?

1633
01:27:01,694 --> 01:27:04,131
Yes. I very much get it.

1634
01:27:04,305 --> 01:27:05,828
I'm so sorry.

1635
01:27:06,002 --> 01:27:08,875
My whole life has changed
so much this past year,

1636
01:27:09,048 --> 01:27:12,574
and I'm just trying to take
responsibility for myself,

1637
01:27:12,748 --> 01:27:17,274
and I'm not at a place where I can
be responsible for someone else, too.

1638
01:27:17,448 --> 01:27:19,972
You don't need to be
responsible for me.

1639
01:27:20,146 --> 01:27:21,757
But I would want to be.

1640
01:27:21,931 --> 01:27:23,194
[laughs]
I-I would.

1641
01:27:23,368 --> 01:27:25,457
[chuckles]
Okay. That's so nice.

1642
01:27:25,631 --> 01:27:28,154
We need to figure our shooot
out, you know?

1643
01:27:29,547 --> 01:27:31,246
Can we be friends?

1644
01:27:32,333 --> 01:27:34,030
Gross.
I know.

1645
01:27:34,204 --> 01:27:36,207
Does it... Do you get sick
when you say it?

1646
01:27:36,381 --> 01:27:38,818
Yeah, I feel nauseous.
'Cause it hurts my ears.

1647
01:27:38,992 --> 01:27:41,125
- Could we be friends, though?
- Yuck.

1648
01:27:41,298 --> 01:27:43,475
Is there a world...
Yeah, sure.

1649
01:27:43,649 --> 01:27:45,346
In which we could be friends?
Yes.

1650
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:48,350
Should've just told the Uber to
come right to the restaurant.

1651
01:27:48,524 --> 01:27:50,090
[laughing]
No, it's fine. It's fine.

1652
01:27:50,265 --> 01:27:52,484
I actually went to the
doctor this morning, and, uh,

1653
01:27:52,658 --> 01:27:54,355
he says I'll be able
to start training soon.

1654
01:27:54,529 --> 01:27:56,748
Are you crazy?
You still want to?

1655
01:27:56,922 --> 01:27:58,663
Yeah, I still want to.

1656
01:27:58,837 --> 01:28:01,885
I want to run the goddamn
New York City Marathon.

1657
01:28:02,059 --> 01:28:05,018
My whole life,
the world told me I was lazy

1658
01:28:05,192 --> 01:28:06,454
because of
the way I looked.

1659
01:28:06,628 --> 01:28:08,543
And I told myself
the same thing.

1660
01:28:08,717 --> 01:28:10,109
flap that.

1661
01:28:10,284 --> 01:28:13,853
I said I was gonna run
that race, and I'm going to.

1662
01:28:14,027 --> 01:28:15,594
Okay.

1663
01:28:15,768 --> 01:28:17,552
So, what now?

1664
01:28:17,726 --> 01:28:19,641
You're just gonna go home
and hang with Gretchen?

1665
01:28:19,815 --> 01:28:21,296
Oh, she moved in
with Terrence.

1666
01:28:21,470 --> 01:28:22,688
Oh.

1667
01:28:22,862 --> 01:28:24,863
You have the place
to yourself.

1668
01:28:25,037 --> 01:28:26,692
I could come over.

1669
01:28:26,865 --> 01:28:29,042
But you're not...
you're not going to.

1670
01:28:29,216 --> 01:28:30,695
I'm homeless.

1671
01:28:30,869 --> 01:28:32,219
Homeless?
Yes.

1672
01:28:32,394 --> 01:28:34,569
You have whatever couch
you've been sleeping on.

1673
01:28:34,743 --> 01:28:36,528
Oh.

1674
01:28:36,702 --> 01:28:38,747
That's me.

1675
01:28:42,055 --> 01:28:43,448
Bye, friend.

1676
01:28:43,622 --> 01:28:45,493
[both laugh]

1677
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:48,148
[Jern]
Hey.

1678
01:28:48,323 --> 01:28:49,975
Call me tomorrow?

1679
01:29:29,189 --> 01:29:30,974
Go on.

1680
01:29:31,148 --> 01:29:33,279
[woman]
Hold it, please!

1681
01:29:36,675 --> 01:29:38,807
[chuckling]
Thank you.

1682
01:29:40,199 --> 01:29:42,811
[quiet chatter]

1683
01:29:58,435 --> 01:30:02,135
- [cheering]
- [chattering]

1684
01:30:11,056 --> 01:30:13,886
[heartbeat thumping]

1685
01:30:30,293 --> 01:30:32,164
[exhales]

1686
01:30:48,617 --> 01:30:49,835
[man]
Runners!

1687
01:30:50,706 --> 01:30:52,533
On your mark!

1688
01:30:56,929 --> 01:30:58,322
One block.

1689
01:31:08,462 --> 01:31:11,552
[starting gun fires]
[cheering, applause]

1690
01:31:17,601 --> 01:31:19,908
[man on PA]
Good morning, runners.

1691
01:31:20,082 --> 01:31:21,693
Welcome.

1692
01:31:21,867 --> 01:31:23,826
You are 50,000 strong,

1693
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:27,743
from over 125 nations,

1694
01:31:27,917 --> 01:31:30,484
all 50 states,

1695
01:31:30,658 --> 01:31:34,226
all here at the crossroads
of the world.

1696
01:31:35,663 --> 01:31:39,189
Today, you are taking part
