1
00:01:11,272 --> 00:01:12,454
Dozed off. Ready to rock.

2
00:01:12,555 --> 00:01:13,712
- Dude...
- [exhales deeply]

3
00:01:13,813 --> 00:01:15,692
...you were talking
in your sleep.

4
00:01:15,792 --> 00:01:18,161
- [laughs]
- Son of a bitch.

5
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,030
That-- that's a 200-dollar tie.

6
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:21,728
Yeah, well,
Ashley hates when I crease.

7
00:01:21,828 --> 00:01:23,599
- So...
- [man] Uh-huh. Well,

8
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,301
our presentation's at 3:00.

9
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,558
Well, get the team assembled.

10
00:01:26,658 --> 00:01:27,736
- Let's do this.
- Got it.

11
00:01:28,322 --> 00:01:30,322
[phone rings]

12
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:32,674
Hey, sweetie. What's up?

13
00:01:32,775 --> 00:01:35,177
Hi, sweetie.
A-- a couple things.

14
00:01:35,277 --> 00:01:37,614
You didn't tell your friend
that we were coming back

15
00:01:37,713 --> 00:01:39,481
to your hometown
for Thanksgiving, did you?

16
00:01:39,581 --> 00:01:41,183
What? Baby, no. Why?

17
00:01:41,283 --> 00:01:43,652
Well,
we got a snail-mail invitation

18
00:01:43,753 --> 00:01:46,555
<i>from your buddy, Mitchell, if--</i>
<i> if you want to call it that.</i>

19
00:01:46,656 --> 00:01:48,290
Are his balls in it?

20
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,826
[Ashley] And his entire asshole.

21
00:01:50,926 --> 00:01:52,061
[Hodges]<i> Hmm. I'm so sorry.</i>

22
00:01:52,161 --> 00:01:53,677
You know,
why don't you just go ahead

23
00:01:53,777 --> 00:01:54,816
and throw that thing away?

24
00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:56,753
Okay? I am not dragging you
back there again.

25
00:01:56,853 --> 00:01:58,067
Thank God. Once was plenty.

26
00:01:58,168 --> 00:02:00,302
<i> Honestly,</i>
<i> it was a little traumatizing.</i>

27
00:02:00,403 --> 00:02:03,472
<i> I don't think those people</i>
<i> have evolved.</i>

28
00:02:03,572 --> 00:02:05,450
[Hodges] Yeah, well,
it's 'cause they haven't.

29
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:07,227
- [Ashley]<i> I know, right?</i>
- [grunts] God!

30
00:02:07,328 --> 00:02:08,925
I guarantee you
they're still drinking,

31
00:02:09,026 --> 00:02:10,742
hooking up with each other,
picking fights

32
00:02:10,842 --> 00:02:12,200
and talking
about the glory days.

33
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,858
- [Ashley]<i> And eating meat.</i>
- Exactly.

34
00:02:13,957 --> 00:02:15,555
That's why
I got the hell out of there.

35
00:02:15,655 --> 00:02:16,786
Well, look at you now.

36
00:02:16,885 --> 00:02:20,506
Great job. Amazing condo.
And best of all...

37
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:23,225
you're dating a Sinclair.

38
00:02:23,325 --> 00:02:25,362
- [Ashley chuckles]
- Yeah. Well, I'm a lucky man.

39
00:02:25,462 --> 00:02:28,198
Oh, the other piece of biz,
daddy called and said

40
00:02:28,298 --> 00:02:30,599
we're leaving for the cabin
tonight instead of Sunday.

41
00:02:30,699 --> 00:02:33,368
<i> -Fun, huh?</i>
- Um... Yeah.

42
00:02:33,468 --> 00:02:35,504
That-- That's great.
How cool is that?

43
00:02:35,604 --> 00:02:39,209
So come home right after work,
okay? Love you. Bye.

44
00:02:39,308 --> 00:02:40,509
Okay, love you. Bye.

45
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,846
[whispers] Twenty minutes.
[shouts] flap!

46
00:02:42,945 --> 00:02:44,228
[phone rings]

47
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:47,832
[phone beeping]

48
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:50,936
[Hodges]
"Breast or thigh?" [grunts]

49
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,789
[man] Hey, hey, hey! Watch out!

50
00:02:53,889 --> 00:02:57,509
- [man] There you go.
- Oh, hey, sorry. In a hurry.

51
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:02,281
- [baby crying]
- [car honking]

52
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:13,224
[indistinct chatter]

53
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:22,401
[exhales]

54
00:03:22,501 --> 00:03:24,586
Good to see you again,
Mr. Hodges.

55
00:03:24,687 --> 00:03:26,421
Have you come to a decision?

56
00:03:26,521 --> 00:03:27,521
I have.

57
00:03:27,621 --> 00:03:30,793
Off your recommendation,
I would like the Bramfort cut

58
00:03:30,893 --> 00:03:32,528
on the Priscilla setting.

59
00:03:32,628 --> 00:03:34,563
- Excellent choice.
- Thank you.

60
00:03:34,663 --> 00:03:36,533
[inhales, exhales]

61
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,670
Nothing but the finest
for the Senator's daughter.

62
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:39,918
[phone beeps]

63
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:41,954
Sorry.

64
00:03:43,591 --> 00:03:45,456
She looks quite different
on television.

65
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,593
Just a weird filter.

66
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:55,000
[car honking]

67
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,420
Man. [sighs]

68
00:03:58,521 --> 00:03:59,704
[man whistles]

69
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:05,677
Set.

70
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:07,646
Go.

71
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:12,283
[tires screeching]

72
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:23,661
[woman clears throat]

73
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,632
[chuckles]

74
00:04:28,302 --> 00:04:30,687
[clock ticking]

75
00:04:30,786 --> 00:04:32,288
[woman snoring]

76
00:04:32,387 --> 00:04:34,028
[Hodges]
Do I have everyone's attention?

77
00:04:36,377 --> 00:04:38,761
Question.
What is more important?

78
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:42,314
What's inside the box
or the box itself?

79
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:45,817
[whirring]

80
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,819
It's all about perception.

81
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:53,959
Oh, my God. Wow.

82
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,545
[sighs]

83
00:04:56,646 --> 00:04:58,880
Excellent work. Let's sit down
after the holidays.

84
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,817
Would love to, ma'am.
Thank you so much.

85
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:03,319
Wow. I mean, it doesn't get
any better than that.

86
00:05:03,418 --> 00:05:05,096
- Uh, yes, it does.
- [clamoring over TV]

87
00:05:05,197 --> 00:05:07,353
- [journalists]<i> Senator! Senator!</i>
<i> -Okay, okay, okay.</i>

88
00:05:07,452 --> 00:05:09,625
Your future father-in-law
is on CNN.

89
00:05:09,725 --> 00:05:11,894
<i> Yes. The rumors are true.</i>

90
00:05:11,994 --> 00:05:14,564
<i> I am running for president</i>
<i> in the next election.</i>

91
00:05:14,663 --> 00:05:16,182
<i> I will answer</i>
<i> all your questions...</i>

92
00:05:16,281 --> 00:05:17,680
You're about to become
a made-man.

93
00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:19,576
[Senator Sinclair]
<i> Remember, vote Sinclair!</i>

94
00:05:19,677 --> 00:05:21,355
[journalists]
<i> Senator! Senator! Senator!</i>

95
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:23,406
[Senator Sinclair] Patrick,
I apologize

96
00:05:23,505 --> 00:05:24,606
for the quick departure,

97
00:05:24,706 --> 00:05:26,408
but I thought
we'd get out of town early

98
00:05:26,509 --> 00:05:28,677
to avoid
the initial media frenzy.

99
00:05:28,778 --> 00:05:30,312
It's a great idea, sir.

100
00:05:30,411 --> 00:05:32,608
You know, a lot of personalities
use the same strategy

101
00:05:32,709 --> 00:05:34,706
when they're thrust
into the spotlight like that.

102
00:05:34,805 --> 00:05:36,367
Really? Such as?

103
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,771
Well...

104
00:05:38,887 --> 00:05:40,723
Um... I...

105
00:05:40,822 --> 00:05:41,822
Uh...

106
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:43,108
[sighs]

107
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:46,428
Um, sir, there's been something
I've been--

108
00:05:46,528 --> 00:05:48,485
You want to ask my permission
for Ashley's hand.

109
00:05:48,586 --> 00:05:50,466
Yeah. How--
how did you know that?

110
00:05:50,566 --> 00:05:52,634
Why else would you go
to the Michigan Ave BC Clark

111
00:05:52,735 --> 00:05:53,769
five days in a row?

112
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:57,507
- [whispers inaudibly]
- Correction. Six days in a row.

113
00:05:57,606 --> 00:06:01,043
I'm content with your request
for Ashley's hand.

114
00:06:01,144 --> 00:06:02,812
However,
due to the current shift

115
00:06:02,911 --> 00:06:04,862
in my political stature,

116
00:06:04,963 --> 00:06:06,915
it's apparent I have my eyes
on a bigger prize.

117
00:06:07,014 --> 00:06:10,519
Therefore, a son-in-law
who shoplifts coffee,

118
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,356
hops turnstiles, and steals a
cab from a Supreme Court Justice

119
00:06:14,456 --> 00:06:15,625
is a tremendous risk

120
00:06:15,725 --> 00:06:17,562
to the future President
of the United States.

121
00:06:17,661 --> 00:06:18,795
Wouldn't you agree?

122
00:06:18,894 --> 00:06:21,497
Yes, sir. But I did pay
for the coffee, Glenn.

123
00:06:21,596 --> 00:06:22,997
Don't get me wrong, Patrick.

124
00:06:23,098 --> 00:06:25,134
I'm looking forward
to spending the week with you.

125
00:06:25,235 --> 00:06:26,235
So...

126
00:06:26,334 --> 00:06:27,918
from here on out,
watch your step.

127
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:31,507
Whatever you do,
wherever you go,

128
00:06:31,606 --> 00:06:33,576
whatever you say
reflects on me,

129
00:06:33,675 --> 00:06:36,694
from the tiniest blemish
on your record to the...

130
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:39,930
tiniest crease on your tie.

131
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,418
We cool?

132
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:44,519
We cool.

133
00:06:44,617 --> 00:06:48,391
- Great. Welcome to the family.
- Thank you, sir.

134
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:49,707
[plane engine roars]

135
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,579
[phone rings]

136
00:06:55,516 --> 00:06:56,915
Hey. Patrick Hodges.

137
00:06:58,718 --> 00:06:59,718
What?

138
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,620
When?

139
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:09,995
[sighs] It's so sad.

140
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:13,098
I just can't believe
Mitchell's dead.

141
00:07:14,435 --> 00:07:15,766
- What happened?
- [sighs]

142
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:17,136
A car wreck.

143
00:07:17,235 --> 00:07:20,439
Driving home from the local bar.
It's awful.

144
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,894
Mitchell's the one
that always sends you pictures

145
00:07:24,994 --> 00:07:26,478
of his ball sack, right?

146
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:27,846
Yeah.

147
00:07:27,946 --> 00:07:30,098
You know, I'd been meaning
to call him back

148
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,067
for a long time, but--

149
00:07:32,168 --> 00:07:35,737
- God, what a dick I am!
- Aw. It's okay, monkey.

150
00:07:35,838 --> 00:07:37,795
You know, he's been really
trying to get me back

151
00:07:37,894 --> 00:07:39,093
to come home for Thanksgiving.

152
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:40,670
Oh, I guess he's gonna get
his wish.

153
00:07:40,771 --> 00:07:42,110
You know, um...

154
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:45,581
if you want,
I-- I could come with you.

155
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,418
But it's probably better
if-- if you go alone.

156
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:51,553
Yeah, no, baby,
you stay with your family.

157
00:07:51,653 --> 00:07:53,292
- [Ashley] Yeah?
- Okay? I'll... [sighs]

158
00:07:53,391 --> 00:07:54,829
...catch a flight
in the morning...

159
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,127
- Okay.
- ...hit the funeral.

160
00:07:56,228 --> 00:07:58,066
Say hi to my folks,
and I will get out, okay?

161
00:07:58,165 --> 00:07:59,802
- I'll be in Vail in two days.
- [sighs]

162
00:07:59,903 --> 00:08:01,213
- So super sad.
- [sighs]

163
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:04,182
- I love you.
- I love you.

164
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,637
Sorry for your loss, Patrick.

165
00:08:08,737 --> 00:08:11,723
Thank you, sir.
Thank you so much.

166
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:13,591
Ashley?

167
00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:16,012
- Call me when you get there?
- Yeah.

168
00:08:16,112 --> 00:08:18,947
Have a good flight
and just know I'm here for you.

169
00:08:19,048 --> 00:08:21,324
And if I don't pick up,
it's because we're on the slopes

170
00:08:21,425 --> 00:08:23,021
- and I'll call you right back.
- Okay.

171
00:08:23,122 --> 00:08:24,122
- Okay.
- All right.

172
00:08:24,221 --> 00:08:25,221
Bye.

173
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:29,507
[engine revving]

174
00:09:21,028 --> 00:09:22,159
[Hodges] "Ron-defeated"?

175
00:09:23,297 --> 00:09:24,696
Like "undefeated"?

176
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:26,965
Stupid.

177
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:30,201
[phone beeps]

178
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:52,923
[soft rock music playing]

179
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:56,927
[Hodges sighs]

180
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:14,679
[sighs]

181
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:17,732
Patrick.
Good to see you, Captain.

182
00:10:17,832 --> 00:10:19,301
[Hodges] Hey, man.

183
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,957
Oh, you know, under the
circumstances.

184
00:10:21,057 --> 00:10:22,337
- Yeah.
- You're looking good.

185
00:10:22,437 --> 00:10:24,273
You too, Fat Jack.

186
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:25,640
Thanks, man.

187
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,942
Hard to pass up on the wings

188
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,811
when you're the one making 'em,
you know?

189
00:10:28,911 --> 00:10:31,863
[inhales deeply]
Well, glad you made it.

190
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:34,082
Me too.

191
00:10:34,182 --> 00:10:36,885
- Place looks great, bud.
- Oh! Thanks, man.

192
00:10:36,985 --> 00:10:38,870
Pretty proud
of the old Badge Hole.

193
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:43,658
Got to admit,
there ain't much I wouldn't give

194
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:46,095
to have your tender hands

195
00:10:46,195 --> 00:10:48,764
pressed up against my taint
just one more time.

196
00:10:48,864 --> 00:10:50,865
You know, snap you the ball?

197
00:10:50,966 --> 00:10:53,702
That feels a little
inappropriate right now,

198
00:10:53,802 --> 00:10:54,961
but I-- I know what you mean.

199
00:10:55,061 --> 00:10:56,554
- Yeah.
- Yeah, but I get it.

200
00:10:56,654 --> 00:10:58,534
Mitchell would've been so happy
that you came.

201
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:02,394
Guys are at the end of the bar.

202
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:08,900
[sighs]

203
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:10,970
Hey, Sonny D.

204
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:14,239
No handshakes today, man.

205
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:16,692
[sniffles]

206
00:11:16,792 --> 00:11:18,693
Man, I'm so sorry,
it's been so long--

207
00:11:18,793 --> 00:11:20,162
Shh. Don't worry about it, man.

208
00:11:20,261 --> 00:11:21,261
All right.

209
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:23,914
Get your ass in my arms.

210
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:25,900
[Hodges] Oh, Ledbetter.

211
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,769
Missed the shooot out of you, man.

212
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,687
Yeah, I miss you, too, bro.
Really.

213
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,008
Hey, Mitchell.

214
00:11:32,107 --> 00:11:33,107
- Oh!
- [screams]

215
00:11:33,206 --> 00:11:34,844
- [all laughing]
- Got you, bitch!

216
00:11:34,943 --> 00:11:37,013
- What?
- You thought I was dead?

217
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,681
I'm not dead. I'm alive.

218
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,379
[Sonny D]
You should've seen your face.

219
00:11:40,479 --> 00:11:42,652
Mitchell,
you're so fucked up, dude!

220
00:11:42,751 --> 00:11:44,153
Look, he's been crying!

221
00:11:44,253 --> 00:11:46,022
- Yeah.
- Aw. You've been crying?

222
00:11:46,121 --> 00:11:48,124
About me?
Oh, my God, I am so touched.

223
00:11:48,224 --> 00:11:49,792
- Yeah, right here.
- [groans]

224
00:11:49,892 --> 00:11:52,427
Take a bow.
And while you're down there...

225
00:11:52,528 --> 00:11:53,845
Get off of me! Get off of me!

226
00:11:53,945 --> 00:11:56,302
[Mitchell] Okay, okay, okay.
Guys, enough, enough, enough.

227
00:11:56,402 --> 00:11:57,759
All right.
You guys are assholes.

228
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:01,302
Oh, come on. Get over it, man.
You ghosted us for 15 years.

229
00:12:01,403 --> 00:12:03,120
Last time you came back,
you didn't even--

230
00:12:03,221 --> 00:12:04,221
You didn't even tell us.

231
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,841
How else were we supposed
to get you back here?

232
00:12:06,942 --> 00:12:09,010
Okay. Okay.
Well, I appreciate the gesture.

233
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:11,813
[chuckles] Guys, I really do.
I'm so happy you're alive.

234
00:12:11,913 --> 00:12:13,416
But I have to be in Vail
right now.

235
00:12:13,515 --> 00:12:15,083
Oh, Vail? Of what?

236
00:12:15,183 --> 00:12:17,720
- Colorado.
- Oh, come on. You just got here.

237
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,537
You're gonna leave?
Come on. Have a drink.

238
00:12:19,636 --> 00:12:20,754
I'm dead, for Christ's sake.

239
00:12:20,855 --> 00:12:21,932
- No, I can't.
- One beer.

240
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:23,408
- Dude, just one.
- No!

241
00:12:28,782 --> 00:12:31,734
And her dad, I swear to God,
found out yesterday,

242
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,351
- he's running for president.
- What?

243
00:12:33,451 --> 00:12:34,903
- President.
- [Fat Jack] Oh, wow.

244
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,239
So you're gonna be, like,
part of the royal family?

245
00:12:37,338 --> 00:12:38,856
Uh, yeah, kind of, yeah.

246
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:40,426
Dude,

247
00:12:41,408 --> 00:12:43,806
I can still fulfill my plan
of the emancipation copulation.

248
00:12:43,905 --> 00:12:45,743
- The what now?
- I was gonna win the Heisman

249
00:12:45,842 --> 00:12:47,817
as the first defensive lineman
ever,

250
00:12:47,917 --> 00:12:49,418
get invited to the White House,

251
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:51,386
tag a cheerleader
in the Lincoln Bedroom.

252
00:12:51,486 --> 00:12:52,721
- Mm.
- Why?

253
00:12:52,822 --> 00:12:54,956
'Cause Lincoln was down
for my people.

254
00:12:55,057 --> 00:12:56,357
- [phone buzzes]
- All right.

255
00:12:56,457 --> 00:12:59,360
All I know is that whoever
is cutting the north lawn

256
00:12:59,461 --> 00:13:02,030
at the White House,
doesn't know how to cut grass.

257
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:03,899
Vertical lines look like shooot
on TV.

258
00:13:03,999 --> 00:13:06,469
Guys, also by the way, uh,
he has to go get elected first.

259
00:13:06,568 --> 00:13:08,504
- So this is, like--
- Yes. Yeah, guys.

260
00:13:08,604 --> 00:13:10,206
- Have some respect. Jeez.
- Thank you.

261
00:13:10,306 --> 00:13:11,903
Listen,
future, uh, first-son-in-law...

262
00:13:12,004 --> 00:13:14,243
- Inauguration. Interactive DJ?
- Yeah.

263
00:13:14,342 --> 00:13:15,878
All y'all
are riding my coattails.

264
00:13:15,977 --> 00:13:17,495
Okay, all right.
Guys, I think it's--

265
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:19,113
- I think it's time.
- Another round.

266
00:13:19,212 --> 00:13:20,770
Let's do this, baby.
- No. No, no, no.

267
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:23,318
We all pitched in
and got you a little gift.

268
00:13:23,418 --> 00:13:24,418
Oh.

269
00:13:24,518 --> 00:13:26,354
Right, what are these for?

270
00:13:26,453 --> 00:13:28,770
'Cause you can't be wearing
those sissy shoes you got on.

271
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,259
- For what?
- The game.

272
00:13:30,359 --> 00:13:31,994
We're finally gonna finish it.

273
00:13:32,094 --> 00:13:34,412
- What game?
- "What game?"

274
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:37,165
The '99 Turkey Bowl.

275
00:13:37,265 --> 00:13:39,835
We're gonna play
the second half.

276
00:13:39,934 --> 00:13:40,934
Yeah.

277
00:13:42,187 --> 00:13:44,340
Same field. Same teams.
Same time. Thanksgiving Day.

278
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,356
Wait, this is why
you brought me back out here?

279
00:13:46,456 --> 00:13:47,809
- Yes.
- Are you serious?

280
00:13:47,909 --> 00:13:50,011
- Yes! I'm flaping serious!
- Oh, my God.

281
00:13:50,111 --> 00:13:52,413
It's our second chance

282
00:13:52,514 --> 00:13:54,870
to finally beat Ronnie Best
and the-- the Noble Knob-Jobs.

283
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:56,248
It's seven to seven
at the half

284
00:13:56,347 --> 00:13:58,065
before the storm
of the century cursed us.

285
00:13:58,164 --> 00:13:59,283
If we didn't get snowed out,

286
00:13:59,383 --> 00:14:01,356
'99 would've been our year
to finally win it.

287
00:14:01,456 --> 00:14:03,225
And now Ronnie Best
walks around this town

288
00:14:03,325 --> 00:14:05,794
like he owns the place,
buying up everything.

289
00:14:05,894 --> 00:14:08,080
You know what I say?

290
00:14:08,179 --> 00:14:10,416
I say flap Ronnie Best
and flap those Noble douchebags.

291
00:14:10,515 --> 00:14:12,168
- Yep.
- Yeah, all right.

292
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,535
- [men screaming]
- Hey!

293
00:14:13,635 --> 00:14:15,136
- [men] Yeah!
- [men clamoring]

294
00:14:15,236 --> 00:14:17,405
- [man] Hey, nice to meet you.
- Whoo!

295
00:14:17,505 --> 00:14:18,941
[man] Turkey!

296
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:21,024
[overlapping chatter]

297
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:27,149
- Was that Nolan?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

298
00:14:27,249 --> 00:14:28,447
He, like, lives in that thing.

299
00:14:28,547 --> 00:14:30,085
- Damn.
- It's the whole team.

300
00:14:30,184 --> 00:14:31,184
- Wow.
- We're here.

301
00:14:31,283 --> 00:14:32,288
We're gonna do this.

302
00:14:32,388 --> 00:14:34,538
Hodges,
are you in or are you out?

303
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:39,260
I-- I think that, um...

304
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,014
Uh, I think that, um...
I-- I think, um...

305
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:46,201
It's Turkey Bowl time!

306
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,619
[men cheering]

307
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,106
[all chanting] Badger red!
Knock 'em dead!

308
00:14:52,206 --> 00:14:56,412
Badger Red! Knock 'em dead!
Badger Red! Knock 'em dead!

309
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,947
Siri,
check all available flights

310
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,948
from Oklahoma City
to Chicago.

311
00:15:00,048 --> 00:15:01,164
Patrick Hodges?

312
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:05,173
- Jennifer Harrison?
- [Jennifer] Dude, what?

313
00:15:05,273 --> 00:15:06,476
[chuckles] Hey.

314
00:15:06,576 --> 00:15:08,413
- Jennifer Harrison.
- Oh, my God. [chuckles]

315
00:15:08,514 --> 00:15:10,351
This is, uh--
Well, this is the ladies' room.

316
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,528
- Um, it is.
- [both chuckle]

317
00:15:12,628 --> 00:15:15,197
- [Hodges] Ah, you look amazing.
- Thank you. You, uh...

318
00:15:15,297 --> 00:15:17,499
You don't look
half-bad yourself.

319
00:15:17,599 --> 00:15:20,418
- This tie here-- Oh, sorry. I--
- I thought we were gonna...

320
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:23,172
- Um...
- [chuckles]

321
00:15:23,272 --> 00:15:25,490
So... [stutters]
...back for the big game?

322
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,210
Town's pretty excited.

323
00:15:28,309 --> 00:15:29,411
Oh, yeah.

324
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,913
- Turkey Bowl!
- [chuckles]

325
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,413
- Whoo!
- [chuckles]

326
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:35,084
"He's so great, number eight."

327
00:15:35,183 --> 00:15:36,951
- Okay. All right.
- Yeah, okay, I'm sorry.

328
00:15:37,052 --> 00:15:38,052
Forget it.

329
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:41,056
So how are you?

330
00:15:41,155 --> 00:15:42,472
- Engaged.
- Pardon?

331
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:44,525
Soon to be engaged.

332
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:47,263
[stammers] Doing a girl--
A great girl.

333
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:50,599
Ashley from Chicago.
And she's pretty, too.

334
00:15:50,698 --> 00:15:53,434
How are you?
What-- Everything good?

335
00:15:53,534 --> 00:15:56,321
[stammers] Yeah, I'm great.
I, uh... I'm not engaged, um...

336
00:15:57,057 --> 00:15:58,456
but, uh, you know...

337
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:00,490
No, I know.

338
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:06,081
- Chicago girl, huh?
- Yeah, Chi Town.

339
00:16:06,181 --> 00:16:07,982
[chuckles] I always thought--

340
00:16:08,082 --> 00:16:10,119
I always thought that you'd
end up getting married

341
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,578
and sticking around here
in town.

342
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,155
Really?

343
00:16:14,255 --> 00:16:16,024
Yeah! To Brandy Best.

344
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,527
Oh, here we go.
Listen, nothing happened.

345
00:16:18,626 --> 00:16:20,328
Jen, I've told you this
a million times.

346
00:16:20,428 --> 00:16:22,067
Well, I'm sure the twins
will be excited

347
00:16:22,167 --> 00:16:24,443
to know that you're here.
If they haven't heard already.

348
00:16:24,543 --> 00:16:27,336
Well, I hope to avoid them
as best as I can.

349
00:16:27,436 --> 00:16:28,686
[chuckles]

350
00:16:29,456 --> 00:16:30,456
[chuckles]

351
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:35,277
[toilet flushes]

352
00:16:35,376 --> 00:16:37,546
- Gross.
- [Jen] Oh, uh...

353
00:16:37,645 --> 00:16:40,282
Well, I should, uh--
I should probably go.

354
00:16:40,381 --> 00:16:41,517
- Yeah.
- And, um...

355
00:16:41,616 --> 00:16:43,735
maybe I'll see you
around this week.

356
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:46,688
- Okay.
- It's nice to see you.

357
00:16:46,788 --> 00:16:48,624
- You too. See ya.
- [Jen] Yeah. Okay.

358
00:16:48,724 --> 00:16:50,475
[indistinct clamoring]

359
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,443
[sighs] Jeez.

360
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:58,067
[crowd chanting] Badger Red!
Knock 'em dead!

361
00:16:58,167 --> 00:16:59,716
Badger red! Knock 'em...

362
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:06,741
[grunts]

363
00:17:06,842 --> 00:17:08,109
Oh, God.

364
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:10,294
[grunts, groans] Oh, God.

365
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:11,763
Ow!

366
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:16,085
[woman] VaJeena Monroe
sent me a text, saying

367
00:17:16,184 --> 00:17:17,685
my Pitter Pat was back in town,

368
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:19,520
but I didn't believe it,

369
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:22,306
not 'til I saw it
with my own eyes.

370
00:17:23,777 --> 00:17:25,594
Are you up-skirting me?

371
00:17:25,693 --> 00:17:27,811
What? No. No, no, no.
I didn't see anything.

372
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:30,782
Bummer.

373
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:33,617
Brandy Best. Long time no see.

374
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:37,439
- What? Whoa!
- [groans]

375
00:17:37,538 --> 00:17:38,538
Okay.

376
00:17:38,637 --> 00:17:42,144
I heard you turned gay,
but I didn't believe it.

377
00:17:42,243 --> 00:17:44,747
Bisexual at the most, right?

378
00:17:44,846 --> 00:17:46,548
Brandy-- Jeez.

379
00:17:46,647 --> 00:17:51,753
My vision board is manifesting
right before my eyes.

380
00:17:51,854 --> 00:17:54,355
I just knew you'd come back
to town for you know who

381
00:17:54,455 --> 00:17:56,340
and you know what.

382
00:17:56,441 --> 00:17:58,326
Okay, I have a girlfriend.
Soon-to-be fiancée,

383
00:17:58,426 --> 00:18:00,561
and this is harassment, okay?

384
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,730
Is it bad
if all that makes me moist?

385
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:05,534
Most girls hate that word,
but...

386
00:18:05,634 --> 00:18:07,036
but I hate most girls.

387
00:18:07,135 --> 00:18:08,170
Just-- This is...

388
00:18:08,269 --> 00:18:10,506
- Please stop...
- I just...

389
00:18:10,605 --> 00:18:12,807
- [Hodges] Just--
- [Brandy speaking indistinctly]

390
00:18:12,907 --> 00:18:14,643
Get your hands
off my baby sister.

391
00:18:14,742 --> 00:18:17,779
[groans] Shut up, Ronnie!
Goddamn it.

392
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,865
You're only three minutes older
than me. We talked about this.

393
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,184
Oh, Patty Hot Jizz.

394
00:18:23,285 --> 00:18:25,086
Not back in town
more than five minutes,

395
00:18:25,186 --> 00:18:26,864
already messing
with my twin sister, huh?

396
00:18:26,963 --> 00:18:29,525
Okay, she attacked me, okay?
Get-- Stop.

397
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,259
Tell it to the judge.

398
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:33,076
- [Brandy chuckles]
- Go get in the truck.

399
00:18:33,176 --> 00:18:34,733
- I'm not getting in the truck.
- Now.

400
00:18:34,834 --> 00:18:36,231
I can stay out here
with you guys.

401
00:18:36,332 --> 00:18:37,566
Get the flap in the truck.

402
00:18:37,665 --> 00:18:38,665
Get your...

403
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:42,420
[groans] Skank.

404
00:18:44,891 --> 00:18:45,891
Ah!

405
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,160
So, Patty Cakes...

406
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:52,480
I didn't think you were
man enough to come back

407
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,650
and finish what we started
all them years ago.

408
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,417
Honestly,
the last thing I want to do--

409
00:18:56,518 --> 00:18:59,520
- Look, you can say--
- There he is. Ronnie, we agreed.

410
00:18:59,621 --> 00:19:02,825
Hodges comes back,
we finish the Turkey Bowl.

411
00:19:02,924 --> 00:19:04,393
Or are you too scared now

412
00:19:04,492 --> 00:19:06,595
that we have our first string
quarterback back?

413
00:19:06,694 --> 00:19:09,097
- flap no, I ain't scared.
- Guys, do we--

414
00:19:09,198 --> 00:19:12,468
Noble Knights have never lost
to Butt Badgers.

415
00:19:12,567 --> 00:19:14,368
And we don't plan to start now.

416
00:19:14,469 --> 00:19:16,105
Well,
if you have nothing to lose,

417
00:19:16,204 --> 00:19:18,321
how 'bout we raise the stakes?

418
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:20,592
Oh.

419
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:24,613
I do want to up the stakes.

420
00:19:24,712 --> 00:19:25,930
- Great.
- [Ronnie] Oh.

421
00:19:27,267 --> 00:19:29,484
- I hope you do.
- Maybe we will.

422
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:30,818
Okay, let's raise 'em.

423
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:32,855
- Okay, let's do it then.
- Okay. Fine.

424
00:19:32,954 --> 00:19:34,355
- Fine.
- You start.

425
00:19:34,455 --> 00:19:36,491
- Great. I will.
- Okay. You start, or I start?

426
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,292
- I'll go first.
- Okay, you start.

427
00:19:38,393 --> 00:19:40,194
- Oh, my God.
- We win,

428
00:19:40,295 --> 00:19:41,679
you stop buying up this town.

429
00:19:42,749 --> 00:19:44,766
You stay
on your side of the tracks

430
00:19:44,865 --> 00:19:46,183
and you never come back.

431
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:47,951
[men] Oh!

432
00:19:49,556 --> 00:19:50,621
[Ronnie chuckles]

433
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,290
So.

434
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:53,709
What do you say?

435
00:19:53,808 --> 00:19:55,309
So what's in it for us?

436
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:57,194
[sighs] Name it.

437
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:58,663
[clicks tongue]

438
00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:03,417
The Badger Hole.

439
00:20:03,518 --> 00:20:05,820
[indistinct murmuring]

440
00:20:05,921 --> 00:20:07,471
[snickering]

441
00:20:10,643 --> 00:20:11,759
- Deal.
- Wait, no--

442
00:20:11,859 --> 00:20:13,394
Time to rewrite history.

443
00:20:13,494 --> 00:20:15,696
Badger Red! Knock 'em dead!

444
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:18,352
- Badger red! Knock 'em dead!
- Noble Knights win their fights!

445
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:19,690
[Hodges] Guys, guys, you can...

446
00:20:19,789 --> 00:20:22,471
- Badger red! Knock 'em dead!
- Noble Knights win their fights!

447
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:25,574
Guys, guys! Stop, stop, stop.

448
00:20:25,673 --> 00:20:28,710
Stop. [chuckles]
Okay. Look at yourselves.

449
00:20:28,809 --> 00:20:30,746
It's embarrassing, okay?

450
00:20:30,846 --> 00:20:32,814
You're almost 40 years old

451
00:20:32,913 --> 00:20:34,790
and you're wearing
Letterman's jackets, right?

452
00:20:34,891 --> 00:20:36,919
Do you really care
about a football game

453
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:38,386
from 15 years ago?

454
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:39,765
You seriously want to finish it?

455
00:20:39,865 --> 00:20:41,582
You're acting
like you're in high school--

456
00:20:41,682 --> 00:20:42,682
[thuds]

457
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:44,859
Fight!

458
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,743
[men screaming]

459
00:20:50,516 --> 00:20:51,548
Hodges!

460
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:55,304
[Ronnie screams]

461
00:20:55,403 --> 00:20:56,505
No, no, no!

462
00:20:56,605 --> 00:20:58,256
- [thuds]
- [glass shatters]

463
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,527
- [gasps]
- [police siren wailing]

464
00:21:04,297 --> 00:21:05,713
[man] Cops!

465
00:21:05,814 --> 00:21:07,365
[crowd screaming]

466
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:10,269
shooot!

467
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:12,604
[siren continues]

468
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:17,326
[Hodges whispering] Okay.
Cut through the secret sidewalk,

469
00:21:17,425 --> 00:21:20,328
hide out in Malone's bushes.
Sneak to my rental car.

470
00:21:20,429 --> 00:21:22,396
Head to the airport.
Great. Whoa.

471
00:21:22,497 --> 00:21:23,855
[Fish]
Hands where I can see 'em!

472
00:21:23,954 --> 00:21:25,950
- Okay. All right.
- [Fish] Turn around.

473
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:30,771
[Fish] Now, slowly bend over.

474
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:32,355
- Excuse me?
- [Fish] Bend over now!

475
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:35,294
Now.

476
00:21:35,609 --> 00:21:37,445
Spread your cheeks.

477
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:38,962
Okay, what the hell, man?

478
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:42,384
- Fish?
- Ah!

479
00:21:42,483 --> 00:21:43,618
Wait, you're a cop now?

480
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,557
I thought I recognized
that tight little ass.

481
00:21:45,656 --> 00:21:46,953
[chuckles] Hey, man.

482
00:21:47,054 --> 00:21:48,730
Graduated top of my class
in the academy.

483
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:50,548
Then again,
I was the only one in my class

484
00:21:50,648 --> 00:21:52,685
but I love what I do.
And I take my job seriously.

485
00:21:52,786 --> 00:21:54,903
- You want a cold one?
- Yeah, man. That'd be great.

486
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:56,565
[gasps]

487
00:21:56,664 --> 00:21:57,833
Thanks.

488
00:21:57,932 --> 00:21:59,468
So where you running off to?

489
00:21:59,567 --> 00:22:01,670
Anywhere.
Out of this freakin' town.

490
00:22:01,769 --> 00:22:02,769
Oh.

491
00:22:03,253 --> 00:22:04,892
Not sticking around
for the Turkey Bowl?

492
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:06,974
Uh, no.
No, I got to get out of here.

493
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:10,311
You and me both, brother.
You and me both.

494
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:11,412
[chuckles]

495
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:17,752
Kenny will pick that up.

496
00:22:17,853 --> 00:22:20,288
So I heard on the wire
that Ronnie Best got thrown

497
00:22:20,388 --> 00:22:22,145
through the back window
of the Badger Hole.

498
00:22:22,246 --> 00:22:23,403
- Is that right?
- Uh, yeah.

499
00:22:23,503 --> 00:22:25,540
It got a little messy.
But you know, he came at me

500
00:22:25,641 --> 00:22:27,077
and-- Hey, you know what?

501
00:22:27,178 --> 00:22:29,135
I just did what Coach McKinney
always taught us.

502
00:22:29,236 --> 00:22:30,992
- "Duck and drive." [chuckles]
- [chuckles]

503
00:22:31,093 --> 00:22:32,834
Awesome.
I bet that felt pretty good.

504
00:22:32,933 --> 00:22:34,302
Yeah, it felt pretty good.

505
00:22:34,403 --> 00:22:35,604
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I believe it.

506
00:22:35,703 --> 00:22:36,703
Well...

507
00:22:36,802 --> 00:22:38,705
confession's
two-tenths of the law,

508
00:22:38,806 --> 00:22:41,001
so I'm gonna have to ask you
to put the open container

509
00:22:41,102 --> 00:22:43,444
on top of the vehicle there
and interlock your fingers

510
00:22:43,545 --> 00:22:45,413
- behind your head.
- You're joking, right?

511
00:22:45,513 --> 00:22:47,131
- Do not resist me!
- Oh, God!

512
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,717
[groans]

513
00:22:48,817 --> 00:22:50,367
Come on, Fish.

514
00:22:50,468 --> 00:22:52,384
I was just having a conversation
with a friend.

515
00:22:52,484 --> 00:22:54,281
Hodges, I told you.
I take my job seriously.

516
00:22:54,382 --> 00:22:55,579
Man, I got to get out of here.

517
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,038
I need to be
in Vail immediately.

518
00:22:57,137 --> 00:22:59,056
[woman over radio]<i> Hey, Fish,</i>
<i> we're impounding</i>

519
00:22:59,155 --> 00:23:00,594
<i> this rental</i>
<i> from the Badger Hole.</i>

520
00:23:00,693 --> 00:23:02,411
Son of a bitch!
My luggage is in that car.

521
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:04,307
Well, maybe
you should've thought about that

522
00:23:04,407 --> 00:23:06,484
before you started throwing
people through windows.

523
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:07,585
Dude, he came at me! Ow!

524
00:23:07,681 --> 00:23:09,921
Relax. Get some sleep.
You'll get where you need to go,

525
00:23:10,008 --> 00:23:11,407
as soon as Judge Tibbins
sees you.

526
00:23:11,486 --> 00:23:12,589
Sees me for what?

527
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:15,492
Arraignment.

528
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:21,450
Good morning, Patrick.

529
00:23:21,549 --> 00:23:22,983
So how've you been?

530
00:23:23,084 --> 00:23:24,284
Great.

531
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:26,042
- Good to see you, sir.
- You as well.

532
00:23:26,143 --> 00:23:27,923
- Well, you're looking good.
- [chuckles]

533
00:23:28,022 --> 00:23:29,391
Looking good. [chuckles]

534
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:31,692
So how did this mix up happen?

535
00:23:31,792 --> 00:23:33,894
Uh... [groans] You know,
boys will be boys, right?

536
00:23:33,994 --> 00:23:34,994
Yes, we will.

537
00:23:37,517 --> 00:23:39,067
Well,
it's not that big of a deal.

538
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:41,536
I'm sure
we can work something out.

539
00:23:41,635 --> 00:23:43,872
Thank you, Judge Tibbins.
Thank you.

540
00:23:43,971 --> 00:23:45,189
How's that throwing arm?

541
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:46,942
Uh, it's good.

542
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:49,644
You staying in shape up there
in the Windy City?

543
00:23:49,743 --> 00:23:52,012
Yeah, I guess.
I run every day, so...

544
00:23:52,113 --> 00:23:55,098
[stammers] That's good to hear.
That's real good to hear.

545
00:23:57,068 --> 00:23:59,086
No disrespect, Judge. But, um,

546
00:23:59,186 --> 00:24:01,088
I'm happy to pay Fat Jack
for his window,

547
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:03,145
but I got to get on the next
flight out of here.

548
00:24:03,246 --> 00:24:06,127
See, I'm proposing to Senator
Dalton Sinclair's daughter

549
00:24:06,228 --> 00:24:08,797
on Thanksgiving Day
in Vail, Colorado.

550
00:24:08,896 --> 00:24:10,398
Whoo-hoo!

551
00:24:10,499 --> 00:24:12,482
- Fancy-fancy. [chuckles]
- Hey.

552
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,710
Well, why don't we
just get this over with.

553
00:24:15,809 --> 00:24:17,638
- Thank you.
- Guilty as charged.

554
00:24:17,739 --> 00:24:21,143
- Thirty days behind bars.
- Wait, what? Why?

555
00:24:21,242 --> 00:24:23,077
Assault. Vandalism.
Public intoxication.

556
00:24:23,178 --> 00:24:24,536
Open container.
Resisting arrest.

557
00:24:24,635 --> 00:24:26,948
No, no, no.
No, that is not what happened.

558
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:30,852
Well, it says in the report
that, uh, we have 20 witnesses

559
00:24:30,951 --> 00:24:32,951
who saw you throw Ronnie Best
through the window.

560
00:24:33,873 --> 00:24:35,457
- Thanks a lot.
- Sorry.

561
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:39,427
Your Honor, no offense,
but this gets me 30 days?

562
00:24:39,528 --> 00:24:41,563
I mean, you were
my T-ball coach for Christ sake.

563
00:24:41,663 --> 00:24:43,632
- Language, inmate.
- I don't have 30 days.

564
00:24:43,731 --> 00:24:45,534
And I cannot have a blemish
on my record.

565
00:24:45,634 --> 00:24:46,650
I see.

566
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:49,069
I see.

567
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:50,771
Well, how 'bout a plea bargain
then?

568
00:24:50,872 --> 00:24:51,872
Anything. Yes.

569
00:24:51,971 --> 00:24:53,741
- Community service?
- Perfect.

570
00:24:53,842 --> 00:24:56,845
I'll throw on an orange jumpsuit
and pick up some trash.

571
00:24:56,944 --> 00:24:58,828
Oh, I have something else
in mind.

572
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:04,836
You too, Judge?

573
00:25:04,934 --> 00:25:06,836
Your call, quarterback.

574
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:08,606
[sighs]

575
00:25:11,711 --> 00:25:12,727
[Hodges] Well...

576
00:25:12,826 --> 00:25:14,729
looks like we got
a game to play.

577
00:25:14,828 --> 00:25:16,707
- [Mitchell] All right! Yes!
- [Sonny D] Whoo!

578
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:18,500
Don't try to run on me,
fugitive.

579
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:20,038
'Cause if you cross
the county line

580
00:25:20,137 --> 00:25:22,252
with this bad boy on...

581
00:25:24,257 --> 00:25:25,606
[clicks]

582
00:25:25,707 --> 00:25:27,942
...you'll never be allowed
to come back.

583
00:25:28,042 --> 00:25:30,846
Sounds tempting.
Oh, looks like my ride's here.

584
00:25:30,945 --> 00:25:32,079
Later today, practice.

585
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,682
- Three o' clock.
- Sounds great.

586
00:25:33,781 --> 00:25:36,232
- All right. See you guys.
- See you later, buddy.

587
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,136
[phone rings]

588
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,240
Hey.

589
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:44,792
Hey, honey.
Where have you been?

590
00:25:44,893 --> 00:25:46,862
I-- I have left,
like, a hundred messages.

591
00:25:46,961 --> 00:25:48,762
I know. I'm sorry.
It's just this...

592
00:25:48,863 --> 00:25:51,532
crazy, crazy funeral, you know?

593
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:54,001
Really?
That bad, huh?

594
00:25:54,102 --> 00:25:57,072
Yeah. It was just awful.

595
00:25:57,172 --> 00:25:58,990
<i> You know, grim.</i>

596
00:25:59,089 --> 00:26:01,207
Open casket. He drowned,
so he was all bloated and--

597
00:26:01,307 --> 00:26:03,144
I-- I thought you said
it was a car accident.

598
00:26:03,863 --> 00:26:06,047
Into a ditch after a heavy rain.

599
00:26:06,146 --> 00:26:07,982
It just-- It just really sucks
here.

600
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:10,684
<i> Yuck.</i>
<i> Are you on your way back?</i>

601
00:26:10,785 --> 00:26:14,637
I-- No. No, I'm not.
It's, uh, gonna be a while.

602
00:26:15,575 --> 00:26:16,590
What? Why?

603
00:26:16,691 --> 00:26:20,528
I-- Well, they named me
executor of his will,

604
00:26:20,628 --> 00:26:23,097
and Mitchell had a lotta
skeletons in his closet, so...

605
00:26:23,198 --> 00:26:24,266
I'm dealing with that.

606
00:26:24,365 --> 00:26:26,800
How rude to make you do,
like, everything.

607
00:26:26,901 --> 00:26:28,338
Are--
are you getting a settlement?

608
00:26:28,439 --> 00:26:30,638
No, but I'm
at the courthouse now

609
00:26:30,739 --> 00:26:32,336
and I'm going through
some stuff, so...

610
00:26:32,436 --> 00:26:34,910
I'll call you when I get
more specifics, okay?

611
00:26:35,009 --> 00:26:36,978
<i> -I love you.</i>
- Leave your phone on.

612
00:26:37,077 --> 00:26:38,895
<i> -Love you. Bye.</i>
- Yeah. Bye.

613
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:42,917
- Hello, stranger.
- [sighs]

614
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:44,018
Hey, Dad.

615
00:26:44,971 --> 00:26:45,971
[chuckles]

616
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:51,726
Hey! Look who I found.

617
00:26:51,826 --> 00:26:54,828
- Patrick. Patrick.
- Hey, Mom.

618
00:26:54,929 --> 00:26:58,833
I am so sorry
about poor Mitchell.

619
00:26:58,932 --> 00:27:00,930
- Cat's out of the bag, Marlene.
- [Hodges sighs]

620
00:27:01,029 --> 00:27:02,452
Oh, I know. I know.

621
00:27:02,553 --> 00:27:04,709
I just like being a part
of things. It's so much fun.

622
00:27:04,808 --> 00:27:06,390
- [chuckles]
- Look at you.

623
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:08,108
You...

624
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:10,027
are so handsome.

625
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:12,580
Thanks, Mom. [chuckles]

626
00:27:12,681 --> 00:27:13,914
I made you hotdog casserole.

627
00:27:14,015 --> 00:27:16,617
Tried a new recipe out
with the kids at school.

628
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,286
They really seem to enjoy it.

629
00:27:18,385 --> 00:27:19,820
Didn't agree with everyone.

630
00:27:19,921 --> 00:27:21,990
I had to clean up some yak
in the girls' gym.

631
00:27:22,089 --> 00:27:24,642
Oh, hush, Eddie!
Come on. Sit down, both of you.

632
00:27:25,678 --> 00:27:26,977
- Here.
- All right.

633
00:27:28,681 --> 00:27:31,098
So you're gonna play
in the game, huh?

634
00:27:31,199 --> 00:27:32,281
Yeah, I guess so.

635
00:27:34,787 --> 00:27:35,836
What's wrong, sweetie?

636
00:27:35,936 --> 00:27:38,740
- Oh, I'm a vegetarian.
- A what?

637
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:40,642
A vegetarian. I don't eat meat.

638
00:27:40,741 --> 00:27:42,277
Ashley's family
has a deep philosophy

639
00:27:42,376 --> 00:27:43,979
about animal cruelty,

640
00:27:44,078 --> 00:27:45,663
and I respect that.

641
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:48,849
I don't think
you can kill a hotdog.

642
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:52,119
Yeah, well, your president
is killing our country, so--

643
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:54,096
- All right. All right.
- Oh, are we gonna go?

644
00:27:54,197 --> 00:27:55,953
All right. All right.
All right. All right.

645
00:27:56,054 --> 00:27:58,342
No politics. No religion.

646
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:00,344
And now, let's add...

647
00:28:01,212 --> 00:28:03,097
food to the no-discussion list.

648
00:28:03,198 --> 00:28:07,102
But we respect your choices,
Patrick. Right, Ed?

649
00:28:07,201 --> 00:28:10,220
And speaking of choices,
how is Ashley, that...

650
00:28:12,892 --> 00:28:13,892
beautiful girl?

651
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,644
Yeah, she's great.

652
00:28:15,743 --> 00:28:17,144
Yeah, she's great.

653
00:28:17,244 --> 00:28:19,713
You know, FOX News
been digging up dirt

654
00:28:19,814 --> 00:28:20,814
on her father lately.

655
00:28:20,913 --> 00:28:22,348
[Hodges sighs]

656
00:28:22,449 --> 00:28:24,608
We'd like to see her
in this neck of the woods again.

657
00:28:24,804 --> 00:28:26,354
- Right, Eddie?
- Sure.

658
00:28:26,453 --> 00:28:28,355
Yeah.
Well, last time she was here,

659
00:28:28,455 --> 00:28:30,013
she got a foot fungus
from the shower,

660
00:28:30,114 --> 00:28:31,912
so it kind of spooked her
just a little bit.

661
00:28:32,011 --> 00:28:34,010
- Iodine works wonders for me.
- Mm-hmm.

662
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:35,979
[chuckles]

663
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,968
You seen Jen Harrison yet?

664
00:28:40,067 --> 00:28:43,753
You know, I actually did.
Yeah, she seems great.

665
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,040
She asks about you all the time.

666
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,875
- Wait, she does?
- Mm-hmm.

667
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:50,010
Yeah, she bought
her folks' old place

668
00:28:50,111 --> 00:28:51,246
over on Raintree.

669
00:28:51,346 --> 00:28:54,163
Living in that big place...

670
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:55,933
all alone.

671
00:28:56,032 --> 00:28:59,936
I believe you're right, Ed,
but our boy has a girlfriend.

672
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,005
Uh, fiancée.

673
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:07,796
That's wonderful.

674
00:29:07,895 --> 00:29:10,131
- Mm-hmm
- Well, I haven't proposed yet,

675
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:11,833
but I have plans
to pop the question

676
00:29:11,932 --> 00:29:13,835
Thanksgiving Day in Vail.

677
00:29:13,934 --> 00:29:15,519
- Oh, you're not engaged yet?
- No.

678
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:17,788
Oh.

679
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:20,353
- Oh. Mm-hmm.
- That's fantastic! [chuckles]

680
00:29:20,452 --> 00:29:22,042
I mean, that you're...

681
00:29:22,143 --> 00:29:24,361
- getting hitched.
- Thank you.

682
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:27,115
I got some good news myself.

683
00:29:27,214 --> 00:29:29,851
My newly restored Chevy's
been chosen to lead

684
00:29:29,951 --> 00:29:32,236
the Grand Gobble Marshals
in the parade this year.

685
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:34,505
- Go Eddie!
- [Ed] Yeah.

686
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:38,075
Glad I'm here to see that.

687
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:46,401
Why don't you go upstairs
and clean up, settle in,

688
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,903
and I'll bring you
a PB and J in a few minutes?

689
00:29:49,002 --> 00:29:51,905
- Thanks, Mom.
- Good to see you, Son,

690
00:29:52,006 --> 00:29:54,875
even if it's only for a few days
against your will.

691
00:29:54,976 --> 00:29:57,894
- Oh, Lord, Eddie.

Yeah. You, too.

862
00:38:01,813 --> 00:38:03,713
- All cleared up.
- [Jen laughs]

863
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:11,949
[Ronnie]
I'll call you back, Mom.

864
00:38:18,697 --> 00:38:20,648
Uh, Boss,
it's hardly noticeable.

865
00:38:20,748 --> 00:38:22,708
- No one's even gonna see it.
- [woman laughing]

866
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,719
Cock-defeated!

867
00:38:24,818 --> 00:38:27,637
- Get the flap out of here!
- [tires screeching]

868
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:29,657
[grunts]

869
00:38:29,757 --> 00:38:31,324
[woman] flap you!

870
00:38:31,425 --> 00:38:32,942
[groans]
It was a good throw, though.

871
00:38:33,577 --> 00:38:34,978
[phone ringing]

872
00:38:35,947 --> 00:38:37,146
Hello?

873
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:38,465
Honey?

874
00:38:38,565 --> 00:38:40,668
- Hey.
- Did-- did you call earlier

875
00:38:40,768 --> 00:38:42,436
<i> -and hang up?</i>
- [Brandy] Pitter Pat.

876
00:38:42,536 --> 00:38:43,719
No, no, no.

877
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,860
- Why would you think that?
- [Brandy] Pitter Pat!

878
00:38:46,358 --> 00:38:47,641
Why are you whispering?

879
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:49,909
I, uh, I'm at a meditation...

880
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:52,780
- for Mitchell.
- A meditation?

881
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,396
Uh, Mitchell was a Buddhist.

882
00:38:55,434 --> 00:38:56,916
Judging from his behavior,

883
00:38:57,016 --> 00:38:58,733
I don't think
he was very religious, babe.

884
00:38:58,833 --> 00:38:59,920
[Brandy] Pitter Pat.

885
00:39:00,019 --> 00:39:01,355
What's that?

886
00:39:01,454 --> 00:39:04,425
- What?
- [Brandy] Oh, Pitter Pat?

887
00:39:04,525 --> 00:39:06,027
Uh, they're doing a chant.

888
00:39:06,126 --> 00:39:07,577
"Pitter..."

889
00:39:08,045 --> 00:39:09,297
I should join in.

890
00:39:09,396 --> 00:39:10,875
[Ashley]
<i> Call me when you can talk.</i>

891
00:39:10,974 --> 00:39:12,800
- Love you. Bye.
- O-- Okay.

892
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:15,617
Oh, shooot, dang it. Man!

893
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:18,521
Son of a gun! Come on.

894
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,045
- [groans]
- Hi, Mr. Man.

895
00:39:24,144 --> 00:39:27,047
- Hey, Brandy.
- It's a long walk home.

896
00:39:27,148 --> 00:39:28,349
You want a lift?

897
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:29,949
No, I'm good. Thank you.

898
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:31,751
I promise that I'll behave.

899
00:39:31,851 --> 00:39:34,722
It's a long walk
to Meadowbrook Drive.

900
00:39:34,822 --> 00:39:36,356
- I think I got it.
- I just...

901
00:39:36,456 --> 00:39:39,141
I've been meaning
to give you something.

902
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:41,945
Oh, come on.

903
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,047
Uh...

904
00:39:51,088 --> 00:39:52,940
You hiding from your girlfriend?

905
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:55,237
- She's not my girlfriend.
- Then why were you hiding?

906
00:39:55,336 --> 00:39:59,045
You know what? I'm gonna walk,
okay? Thank you so much.

907
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:01,398
I will always love you,
Pat Hodges.

908
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:04,067
You're the only one for me!

909
00:40:07,873 --> 00:40:08,873
Hey, sexy.

910
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,141
I'll be there in five. Bye.

911
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:20,101
- You cut grass in the winter?
- All year round.

912
00:40:20,201 --> 00:40:23,137
I don't have to, I just like
to be out here on the field,

913
00:40:23,237 --> 00:40:24,938
you know, be one with the earth.

914
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:27,641
You've had a one-man business
for quite some time, man.

915
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:30,378
You ever think about,
I don't know, expanding?

916
00:40:30,478 --> 00:40:32,114
It was supposed to be
a two-man business

917
00:40:32,215 --> 00:40:33,215
- but...
- Okay.

918
00:40:33,313 --> 00:40:34,898
You know what I mean, right?

919
00:40:34,998 --> 00:40:37,394
Get a crew of guys together,
then you got nothing but time,

920
00:40:37,494 --> 00:40:38,932
right? Rake in that cash,
lawn boy.

921
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:42,088
Is that what you do?

922
00:40:42,188 --> 00:40:44,226
You got a team of men
working for you in the city?

923
00:40:44,326 --> 00:40:46,362
Yeah. I mean, it's on a
different level, but yeah.

924
00:40:46,461 --> 00:40:48,077
- Oh, yeah? Is that right?
- Yeah. Oh.

925
00:40:48,914 --> 00:40:50,130
No, but I'm serious, man.

926
00:40:50,231 --> 00:40:52,532
You get somebody else
to do the work, then--

927
00:40:52,632 --> 00:40:54,501
Then I can what?
Hang out at the Badger?

928
00:40:54,601 --> 00:40:57,070
Yes. Hit Lake Dirtybird
whenever you want, right?

929
00:40:57,170 --> 00:40:59,021
Live in paradise.
Be your own boss.

930
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:01,775
Sit and stare
at the big open sky?

931
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:03,978
- Exactly.
- [Mitchell chuckles]

932
00:41:04,077 --> 00:41:06,038
So you mean exactly
what I already do every day?

933
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:10,900
Yeah.

934
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:15,115
[Mitchell]
Suit up. We got practice.

935
00:41:15,215 --> 00:41:16,873
[engine revving]

936
00:41:23,081 --> 00:41:27,016
- Hey! Yeah!
- [honking]

937
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:30,052
[chuckles]

938
00:41:31,121 --> 00:41:32,489
I have news.

939
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:34,858
Sit.

940
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:38,061
Regarding?

941
00:41:38,161 --> 00:41:39,628
Jen Harrison.

942
00:41:40,532 --> 00:41:41,681
Speak.

943
00:41:41,782 --> 00:41:43,717
- I spotted her with Hodges.
- When?

944
00:41:43,817 --> 00:41:45,853
- Birthday party.
- Tabitha Dean's party?

945
00:41:45,952 --> 00:41:48,103
- Yes.
- She's a little bitch.

946
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:50,557
So what went down?

947
00:41:50,657 --> 00:41:53,460
There was an interactive DJ.
There was ice cream cake.

948
00:41:53,561 --> 00:41:55,318
There was a piñata,
but the kids couldn't--

949
00:41:55,418 --> 00:41:56,418
Between...

950
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:59,532
Jen and Hodges. Details.

951
00:41:59,632 --> 00:42:01,784
Secret meeting
out behind the fence.

952
00:42:03,655 --> 00:42:04,737
Was there any...

953
00:42:04,838 --> 00:42:06,907
public display of affection?

954
00:42:07,007 --> 00:42:10,010
There was a really sweet
daddy-daughter dance.

955
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:12,295
- Everybody started tearing up--
- Between-- Um...

956
00:42:13,164 --> 00:42:14,597
Jen and Hodges.

957
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:19,586
Did they hold hands or kissed?

958
00:42:19,686 --> 00:42:21,789
Did he go up her shirt
or anything?

959
00:42:21,889 --> 00:42:24,706
It was really dark,
so I couldn't tell.

960
00:42:25,943 --> 00:42:27,061
[smacks lips]

961
00:42:27,161 --> 00:42:28,795
[Mitchell] Down!

962
00:42:28,896 --> 00:42:29,896
Set!

963
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:31,297
Hike!

964
00:42:31,798 --> 00:42:32,798
[man pants]

965
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:36,070
[Sonny D groans]

966
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:37,538
[sighs]

967
00:42:37,637 --> 00:42:39,239
[Sonny D] Damn it!
I hate myself.

968
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:40,590
[Hodges] My bad.

969
00:42:41,226 --> 00:42:42,876
Black 80.

970
00:42:42,976 --> 00:42:44,733
I'm your primary receiver.
Not brick hands.

971
00:42:44,833 --> 00:42:46,351
No, Coach McKinney
and I designed it.

972
00:42:46,451 --> 00:42:47,581
Primary is brick hands.

973
00:42:47,681 --> 00:42:49,358
[Sonny D] Hey,
my flaping hands are fine.

974
00:42:49,458 --> 00:42:51,454
[Ledbetter] You catch more balls
with your taint.

975
00:42:51,554 --> 00:42:53,552
- See if you can catch this.
- [Ledbetter groans]

976
00:42:53,652 --> 00:42:54,849
Take a bow, bitch. Come at me.

977
00:42:54,949 --> 00:42:57,123
Test my gangster, motherfucker!
Test my gangster.

978
00:42:57,224 --> 00:43:00,693
Dude, you're supposed to throw
to me. No one expects it.

979
00:43:00,793 --> 00:43:02,963
Yeah, no one expects it
because it's a bad play.

980
00:43:03,063 --> 00:43:05,599
Black 80. You're supposed
to stay here and block for me.

981
00:43:05,699 --> 00:43:07,601
I have run 10,000 routes
for you.

982
00:43:07,701 --> 00:43:09,152
Throw me the flaping football!

983
00:43:10,688 --> 00:43:12,322
This is flaping ridiculous!

984
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:15,159
Inmate!

985
00:43:15,257 --> 00:43:17,710
Get back here
or I will shoot you!

986
00:43:17,811 --> 00:43:18,860
Do me the favor.

987
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:21,581
[groans]

988
00:43:21,681 --> 00:43:23,065
What the flap, Fish?

989
00:43:23,802 --> 00:43:25,233
That wasn't me.

990
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:28,371
Paintballs!

991
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:30,740
Take cover!

992
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:37,847
[slow motion groan]

993
00:43:39,884 --> 00:43:41,284
[men screaming]

994
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:43,603
Mayday!

995
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:44,871
[groans]

996
00:43:44,972 --> 00:43:47,007
Mayday! We're taking heavy fire!

997
00:43:47,106 --> 00:43:48,608
[slow motion groan]

998
00:43:48,708 --> 00:43:49,958
Mayday!

999
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,065
[man] flap you, Hodges!

1000
00:43:59,336 --> 00:44:01,637
Come on, guys.
Let's get these assholes.

1001
00:44:04,009 --> 00:44:05,041
I'm going home.

1002
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:09,849
[mom]<i> There's sloppy joes</i>
<i> in the fridge, Patrick.</i>

1003
00:44:09,949 --> 00:44:11,079
I don't eat meat!

1004
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:13,016
[door closes]

1005
00:44:18,889 --> 00:44:19,974
Finally.

1006
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:21,175
- Hi.
- [Ashley]<i> Hi.</i>

1007
00:44:21,275 --> 00:44:24,277
What's going on?
I haven't heard from you.

1008
00:44:24,378 --> 00:44:26,079
I know. I'm sorry. It's just...

1009
00:44:26,179 --> 00:44:29,849
This place. This town,
it's like a black hole.

1010
00:44:29,949 --> 00:44:32,835
All this bullshit went down
at practice today, and...

1011
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:35,005
Practice?

1012
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:40,661
Hon, ar-- are you there?
Did-- did you say practice?

1013
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:43,664
Yeah, sure did. At the--
at the law practice.

1014
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:45,065
At the lawyer's.

1015
00:44:45,164 --> 00:44:46,983
What a bummer of a practice.
[groans]

1016
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:49,268
When are you getting here?

1017
00:44:49,369 --> 00:44:51,887
[sighs] I...
[sighs] ...I'm not sure.

1018
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:55,409
What do you mean
you're not sure?

1019
00:44:55,509 --> 00:44:57,811
<i> How much more work</i>
<i> can they make you do there?</i>

1020
00:44:57,911 --> 00:44:59,980
Didn't you bury him already?

1021
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:03,250
Hon, yes, but I'm the only one
with any sanity around here,

1022
00:45:03,349 --> 00:45:04,800
so I have to keep things
together.

1023
00:45:05,903 --> 00:45:08,655
Well, I want you here
for Thanksgiving.

1024
00:45:08,755 --> 00:45:10,257
<i> -So does Daddy.</i>
- I'm gonna try.

1025
00:45:10,356 --> 00:45:12,079
Try harder.

1026
00:45:12,179 --> 00:45:13,902
Okay. You know what,
Mitchell is dead.

1027
00:45:14,003 --> 00:45:16,239
- Have some compassion, God.
- [Ashley]<i> I don't get it.</i>

1028
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:18,215
You weren't even really friends
with this guy,

1029
00:45:18,315 --> 00:45:20,313
<i> and suddenly you're the</i>
<i> only one that can help?</i>

1030
00:45:20,414 --> 00:45:22,251
Just because you don't see
somebody every day

1031
00:45:22,351 --> 00:45:24,309
doesn't mean they're still not
your best friend.

1032
00:45:24,409 --> 00:45:26,407
So, now he's your best friend
and not me?

1033
00:45:26,507 --> 00:45:28,925
- No. That is not what I meant.
- [gasps]

1034
00:45:30,862 --> 00:45:31,862
[sighs]

1035
00:45:33,364 --> 00:45:34,947
- Fine.
- Fine.

1036
00:45:35,047 --> 00:45:36,932
- Bye!
- Bye.

1037
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:39,869
[grunts]

1038
00:45:40,739 --> 00:45:42,170
flap. [grunts]

1039
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:47,943
[grunts] flap! Son of a...

1040
00:45:48,947 --> 00:45:49,947
[exhales]

1041
00:45:59,858 --> 00:46:00,922
flap it.

1042
00:46:04,429 --> 00:46:06,813
- [indistinct chatter]
- [all] Woo-hoo!

1043
00:46:06,914 --> 00:46:08,530
[girls cheering]

1044
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:44,199
- Hodges?
- Forty-five, forty-six.

1045
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:47,420
Jen? [chuckles] Wha--

1046
00:46:47,521 --> 00:46:49,088
- Hi.
- Hey.

1047
00:46:49,188 --> 00:46:51,891
What's up?
I'm just getting my laps in.

1048
00:46:51,992 --> 00:46:54,327
Also doing a little
environmental resistance.

1049
00:46:54,427 --> 00:46:56,996
All the rage. A lot of people
are doing that nowadays.

1050
00:46:57,097 --> 00:46:58,998
- But you still live here?
- Yeah.

1051
00:46:59,099 --> 00:47:01,001
I bought it from my parents.

1052
00:47:01,101 --> 00:47:02,135
Well, how cool is that?

1053
00:47:02,235 --> 00:47:05,304
That's great. I'm just doing
my seven-mile daily routine.

1054
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:08,041
Uh, burning some cals
before the big game, you know?

1055
00:47:08,141 --> 00:47:09,476
But, uh, how are you?

1056
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:11,110
You look great. I'm great.

1057
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:13,047
That's good. Listen,
I'm actually on my way--

1058
00:47:13,148 --> 00:47:14,425
I'm not stalking you by the way.

1059
00:47:14,525 --> 00:47:16,150
It's not like I ran over here
to--

1060
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:17,887
I mean, yeah,
of course I ran over here.

1061
00:47:17,987 --> 00:47:21,054
I'm in old P.E. clothes,
sweaty and stuff, but, uh,

1062
00:47:21,153 --> 00:47:23,471
there's a hundred streets
I could've picked in this town,

1063
00:47:23,570 --> 00:47:25,248
you know, and randomly
I picked this one.

1064
00:47:25,347 --> 00:47:26,481
Fate? I don't know.

1065
00:47:26,581 --> 00:47:28,778
- Hodges, I really should get--
- Got to stay in shape

1066
00:47:28,878 --> 00:47:30,596
to beat Ronnie Best
and his band of goons.

1067
00:47:30,695 --> 00:47:31,733
- Hodges--
- That asshole

1068
00:47:31,833 --> 00:47:33,751
with his billboards
and his "Ron-defeated" crap

1069
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:35,248
all over our town.
Not to mention,

1070
00:47:35,349 --> 00:47:37,626
his skanky-ass twin sister
popping up everywhere I look.

1071
00:47:37,726 --> 00:47:40,807
- I would not touch her with a--
- With a ten-foot pole?

1072
00:47:40,907 --> 00:47:41,958
Yes. Thank you.

1073
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:44,427
Hey, Ronnie, what's up, man?

1074
00:47:45,597 --> 00:47:47,581
You're a cheap-shotter, Hodges.

1075
00:47:47,681 --> 00:47:52,085
The funny thing about twins,
we feel each other's pain.

1076
00:47:52,184 --> 00:47:53,583
So when you hurt
my little sister,

1077
00:47:53,682 --> 00:47:54,936
you hurt me also.

1078
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,224
Let's roll, Jenny.

1079
00:47:58,324 --> 00:47:59,827
Wait. Jenny, are you guys--

1080
00:47:59,927 --> 00:48:00,927
- Yes.
- No.

1081
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,197
- It's--
- [Ronnie] We're--

1082
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:05,065
[Jen] Kind of a gray area.

1083
00:48:05,164 --> 00:48:07,083
Technically, he's my boss.

1084
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:10,503
This gal's the best
senior vice president

1085
00:48:10,603 --> 00:48:12,521
- a CEO could ask for.
- [Jen chuckles]

1086
00:48:13,324 --> 00:48:14,623
Ain't that right, Jen-Jen?

1087
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:16,460
Thank you.

1088
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:27,903
- [door closes]
- Oh, no, thank...

1089
00:48:28,539 --> 00:48:29,539
you.

1090
00:48:31,108 --> 00:48:32,974
You just got me
to the sympathy goal line.

1091
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:34,976
Now I'm gonna score.

1092
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:37,097
What are you talking about?

1093
00:48:37,197 --> 00:48:40,434
I'm talking about SVP,
sneak up the middle,

1094
00:48:40,534 --> 00:48:42,068
drive through the hole and...

1095
00:48:42,168 --> 00:48:45,005
[groans] Oh, yeah.

1096
00:48:45,105 --> 00:48:47,039
Oh, don't stop, Daddy.

1097
00:48:47,139 --> 00:48:48,139
[groans]

1098
00:48:48,492 --> 00:48:49,492
Touchdown.

1099
00:48:50,128 --> 00:48:51,626
[exhales deeply]

1100
00:48:54,565 --> 00:48:57,365
When I'm flaping her tonight,
I'm gonna be flaping you.

1101
00:49:03,041 --> 00:49:05,675
When I'm flaping her tonight,
I'm gonna be thinking of you.

1102
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:09,177
That's worse.

1103
00:49:10,347 --> 00:49:11,347
Mm.

1104
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:14,451
Whatever.

1105
00:49:15,152 --> 00:49:16,585
Later, losing team.

1106
00:49:21,492 --> 00:49:23,224
- [door closes]
- [engine starts]

1107
00:49:32,603 --> 00:49:34,103
Getting that heart rate up?

1108
00:49:36,106 --> 00:49:37,106
Yes, sir.

1109
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:41,994
There's only three things
I do when I'm in Noble County.

1110
00:49:42,094 --> 00:49:44,045
I roll my window down.

1111
00:49:44,449 --> 00:49:45,632
I spit.

1112
00:49:45,731 --> 00:49:48,117
And I roll my window back up.

1113
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:51,454
I tell you what, QB...

1114
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:53,722
the rivalry runs deep,

1115
00:49:55,059 --> 00:49:56,059
and this town...

1116
00:49:56,157 --> 00:49:58,177
really could use a victory.

1117
00:49:58,277 --> 00:49:59,277
You understand?

1118
00:49:59,731 --> 00:50:00,731
Yes, sir.

1119
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,599
Don't you run too far.

1120
00:50:05,003 --> 00:50:06,501
- No, sir.
- [vehicle approaching]

1121
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:16,179
[door opens]

1122
00:50:16,277 --> 00:50:19,532
- [door closes]
- [Hodges pants]

1123
00:50:19,632 --> 00:50:21,969
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, Mom made sloppy joes.

1124
00:50:22,068 --> 00:50:25,038
- No, I'm good. Remember?
- Oh, right.

1125
00:50:25,137 --> 00:50:26,739
You don't like meat anymore.

1126
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:28,318
No,
it's not that I don't like meat.

1127
00:50:28,418 --> 00:50:30,978
It's that--
Damn, that smells so good.

1128
00:50:31,077 --> 00:50:32,327
Help yourself. I'm stuffed.

1129
00:50:35,065 --> 00:50:36,682
- Has Mom talked to you?
- What?

1130
00:50:36,782 --> 00:50:39,152
Your Aunt Carol's got the gout.

1131
00:50:39,251 --> 00:50:41,487
Feet swell up like clown shoes,

1132
00:50:41,588 --> 00:50:43,585
so she and I are gonna be gone
for a couple days.

1133
00:50:43,686 --> 00:50:45,659
[chuckles] Well,
give her a hug for me.

1134
00:50:45,759 --> 00:50:47,476
- I'll try.
- Okay.

1135
00:50:47,577 --> 00:50:49,693
It's a shame we're not gonna
be here for the parade.

1136
00:50:49,793 --> 00:50:51,233
But we'll be back
for the big game.

1137
00:50:52,083 --> 00:50:53,083
All right.

1138
00:50:55,286 --> 00:50:56,286
Hey, Dad?

1139
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:58,054
Uh-huh?

1140
00:50:58,153 --> 00:51:01,007
What do you think
of this whole Turkey Bowl thing?

1141
00:51:01,108 --> 00:51:02,190
[chuckles]

1142
00:51:05,128 --> 00:51:06,394
Well, you haven't been around.

1143
00:51:07,297 --> 00:51:08,297
Putnam...

1144
00:51:09,266 --> 00:51:10,416
had it pretty rough.

1145
00:51:10,516 --> 00:51:12,619
You know, after your game
was snowed out,

1146
00:51:12,719 --> 00:51:14,554
some people say
that storm was a curse.

1147
00:51:14,653 --> 00:51:16,672
Yeah, I've been hearing that.

1148
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:18,791
And then after the Turkey Bowl,

1149
00:51:18,891 --> 00:51:20,760
you remember
that Noble had a better record,

1150
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:22,795
and they went on to win
the state championship.

1151
00:51:22,896 --> 00:51:25,699
For a small town,
that's quite an accomplishment.

1152
00:51:25,798 --> 00:51:28,550
Put 'em on the map.
People knew Noble.

1153
00:51:29,286 --> 00:51:30,436
Noble thrived and...

1154
00:51:30,536 --> 00:51:32,639
left Putnam in the shadows.

1155
00:51:32,739 --> 00:51:36,777
[Mom]<i> Eddie? I don't want to be</i>
<i> on the road too late.</i>

1156
00:51:36,876 --> 00:51:39,260
I'm coming! Hey.

1157
00:51:40,297 --> 00:51:41,514
No funny business around here

1158
00:51:41,614 --> 00:51:43,231
- while we're gone, okay?
- Okay.

1159
00:51:48,172 --> 00:51:49,172
Patrick?

1160
00:51:51,541 --> 00:51:54,242
Look, I know people take this
real serious around here...

1161
00:51:55,713 --> 00:51:57,230
but at the end of the day...

1162
00:51:57,329 --> 00:51:59,782
[chuckles]
...it's just a football game.

1163
00:52:00,684 --> 00:52:01,817
[chuckles]

1164
00:52:10,193 --> 00:52:11,726
[sighs, chuckles]

1165
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:16,764
Mm. Oh, my God.

1166
00:52:23,273 --> 00:52:24,405
What the...

1167
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:28,295
Oh... [grunts] ...God.

1168
00:52:28,394 --> 00:52:32,132
Jeez. Nolan, how long you been
hanging up there, man?

1169
00:52:32,231 --> 00:52:34,568
- [grunts]
- You all right?

1170
00:52:34,668 --> 00:52:36,452
[Nolan pants]

1171
00:52:37,722 --> 00:52:38,842
I don't know. I must have...

1172
00:52:40,257 --> 00:52:43,210
- blacked out or something.
- Oh, man.

1173
00:52:43,309 --> 00:52:44,309
Uh...

1174
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:48,614
- Ronnie's goons.
- [groans]

1175
00:52:48,715 --> 00:52:50,550
Town rivalry, though. It's--

1176
00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:53,320
It's okay.
It's part of the job. I'm okay.

1177
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,855
Hey, can I get you a ride home?

1178
00:52:54,954 --> 00:52:55,954
Uh...

1179
00:52:56,456 --> 00:52:58,657
- No, I got my bike.
- I'll grab your bike.

1180
00:52:58,757 --> 00:53:01,894
Let me get that for you, bud.
There you go.

1181
00:53:01,994 --> 00:53:03,762
- There you go.
- [pants]

1182
00:53:03,862 --> 00:53:05,898
Thanks for getting me down.

1183
00:53:05,998 --> 00:53:06,998
Yeah.

1184
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:09,284
You always save the day, Hodges.

1185
00:53:11,755 --> 00:53:13,621
Oh. Thanks, Nolan.

1186
00:53:15,326 --> 00:53:17,577
- Okay. All right.
- [inhaling]

1187
00:53:17,677 --> 00:53:19,778
That's good. All right, buddy.

1188
00:53:19,878 --> 00:53:21,248
Ride safe, huh?

1189
00:53:21,347 --> 00:53:22,347
Suit up.

1190
00:53:22,447 --> 00:53:24,266
Yeah, get your helmet on.

1191
00:53:24,969 --> 00:53:26,335
See you, dude.

1192
00:53:28,206 --> 00:53:30,757
Be careful of the tree there.

1193
00:53:30,856 --> 00:53:32,559
Yeah, careful of the-- Yeah.

1194
00:53:32,659 --> 00:53:33,876
Go around that.

1195
00:53:35,478 --> 00:53:37,579
There. Just fix your--
Yeah, see you, buddy.

1196
00:53:40,351 --> 00:53:41,601
- Wow.
- [thud]

1197
00:53:41,701 --> 00:53:42,818
- Oh, God.
- [Nolan groans]

1198
00:53:42,918 --> 00:53:44,320
[glass clattering]

1199
00:53:58,603 --> 00:53:59,603
You rang?

1200
00:54:00,471 --> 00:54:01,721
We got to talk.

1201
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:02,838
[knocking]

1202
00:54:04,641 --> 00:54:06,119
- What's going on?
- We got to talk.

1203
00:54:06,219 --> 00:54:07,219
- Yeah.
- Now?

1204
00:54:07,318 --> 00:54:08,677
- Yes.
- Come on. Grab your keys.

1205
00:54:08,777 --> 00:54:09,777
Hold on.

1206
00:54:11,014 --> 00:54:13,248
[Cammie] Wait.
Sonny, what are you doing?

1207
00:54:15,385 --> 00:54:17,385
I don't know.
My team needs me.

1208
00:54:20,358 --> 00:54:22,342
[Cammie] Okay,
just use the front door, though.

1209
00:54:22,442 --> 00:54:24,277
- I mean--
- Can I use the window?

1210
00:54:24,376 --> 00:54:25,878
It's a lot more exciting
this way.

1211
00:54:25,978 --> 00:54:28,456
Yeah, all right. That's fine.
I need you to get baby formula,

1212
00:54:28,556 --> 00:54:30,193
though, because I have to pump
and dump.

1213
00:54:30,293 --> 00:54:31,411
- Okay.
- Wait, wait, wait.

1214
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:33,547
Could you ask her
if you can bring your balls too?

1215
00:54:33,646 --> 00:54:35,164
- What was that, Mitchell?
- Nothing.

1216
00:54:35,264 --> 00:54:36,862
- Bye, guys.
- Okay, love you, sweetie.

1217
00:54:36,961 --> 00:54:37,961
I love you. Be good.

1218
00:54:38,061 --> 00:54:39,061
- Okay.
- All right.

1219
00:54:44,849 --> 00:54:46,681
[bird calls]

1220
00:54:49,887 --> 00:54:52,505
- [Hodges sighs]
- What are we doing here?

1221
00:54:52,605 --> 00:54:54,840
Okay.
I can only take so much.

1222
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:57,476
Tonight, I had to cut Nolan
out of a tree in my front yard.

1223
00:54:57,577 --> 00:54:59,813
- Welcome to our world.
- Why are we at Rambling Oaks?

1224
00:54:59,913 --> 00:55:01,514
This is the plan.

1225
00:55:01,614 --> 00:55:03,416
- Recruit old people?
- No.

1226
00:55:03,516 --> 00:55:06,418
- We're getting Coach.
- Oh.

1227
00:55:06,518 --> 00:55:08,387
Yeah, that's the first
good call you've made.

1228
00:55:08,487 --> 00:55:10,322
Hey, guys, our QB is back.

1229
00:55:10,422 --> 00:55:12,059
- Let's do this.
- [Sonny D] Wait, wait.

1230
00:55:12,159 --> 00:55:14,317
This place is a fortress.
Cammie's meemaw lives here.

1231
00:55:14,416 --> 00:55:16,213
You can't sign her out
unless you're family.

1232
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:17,711
That's why
we're sneaking him out.

1233
00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:21,750
[chuckling]

1234
00:55:25,422 --> 00:55:28,456
[chuckling continues]

1235
00:55:42,472 --> 00:55:43,505
Hey, Coach.

1236
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:45,842
[Mitchell] Hey.

1237
00:55:48,411 --> 00:55:50,896
- Is it game time yet, boys?
- Yeah.

1238
00:55:50,996 --> 00:55:51,996
Okay, okay.

1239
00:55:52,096 --> 00:55:54,900
Every down is played
from the ground up,

1240
00:55:55,001 --> 00:55:57,369
from the very soles of our feet

1241
00:55:57,469 --> 00:55:59,472
to the tops
of our hard-hitting heads.

1242
00:55:59,572 --> 00:56:01,875
Every fiber of you
goes into the game.

1243
00:56:01,974 --> 00:56:04,492
You'll leave it all
on the field.

1244
00:56:05,896 --> 00:56:07,096
And the last thing you do...

1245
00:56:08,932 --> 00:56:10,599
before you take
your dying breath...

1246
00:56:13,903 --> 00:56:16,356
is go out there and beat
the living shooot out of Noble.

1247
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:18,391
- Yeah!
- [all laughing]

1248
00:56:18,490 --> 00:56:19,490
Let's go.

1249
00:56:21,077 --> 00:56:23,596
[Coach] Every down we must play
from the ground up,

1250
00:56:23,695 --> 00:56:26,632
from the very soles of our feet

1251
00:56:26,733 --> 00:56:28,934
to the tops
of our hard-hitting heads.

1252
00:56:29,034 --> 00:56:31,938
Every down we must play
from the ground up,

1253
00:56:32,038 --> 00:56:34,873
- from the very soles of...
- All right. Well, note to self.

1254
00:56:34,974 --> 00:56:36,172
Next time I plan a kidnapping,

1255
00:56:36,271 --> 00:56:38,478
make sure the victim
hasn't lost his mind.

1256
00:56:38,577 --> 00:56:39,813
It could be worse.

1257
00:56:39,913 --> 00:56:41,447
- How?
- [Coach] From the very soles

1258
00:56:41,547 --> 00:56:42,581
of our feet...

1259
00:56:42,681 --> 00:56:44,065
[groans] What is that smell?

1260
00:56:45,835 --> 00:56:47,454
Coach made a poopy.

1261
00:56:47,554 --> 00:56:48,831
Butt wipes are in the glove box.

1262
00:56:48,931 --> 00:56:49,989
[Ledbetter groans]

1263
00:56:50,088 --> 00:56:51,088
Wha--

1264
00:56:51,523 --> 00:56:52,659
Who's gonna watch him?

1265
00:56:52,759 --> 00:56:55,929
[Coach] Every down we must play
from the ground up...

1266
00:56:56,028 --> 00:56:57,429
Roshambo.

1267
00:56:57,530 --> 00:56:58,530
Yep.

1268
00:56:58,831 --> 00:57:00,467
[Mitchell]
One, two, three, shoot.

1269
00:57:00,567 --> 00:57:01,835
[Ledbetter] flap!

1270
00:57:01,934 --> 00:57:04,670
Every fiber of you must go
into the game.

1271
00:57:04,771 --> 00:57:06,847
Speaking of fiber,
you should change him soon, Led.

1272
00:57:06,947 --> 00:57:08,474
flap all y'all.

1273
00:57:08,574 --> 00:57:10,572
[Coach] Every fiber of you
must go into the game.

1274
00:57:10,672 --> 00:57:11,909
Hey, isn't that Ronnie's house?

1275
00:57:12,010 --> 00:57:15,849
[Coach] Every fiber of you
must go into the game.

1276
00:57:15,949 --> 00:57:17,766
[jingling]

1277
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:21,653
Lawn job!

1278
00:57:21,753 --> 00:57:22,753
Yeah!

1279
00:57:23,188 --> 00:57:28,094
Let's get out there and beat
the living shooot out of Noble!

1280
00:57:28,193 --> 00:57:30,445
[all screaming]

1281
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:38,454
[snores]

1282
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:41,590
Is it game time yet?

1283
00:57:42,226 --> 00:57:44,092
No, Coach! Go back to bed.

1284
00:57:47,864 --> 00:57:48,864
Damn.

1285
00:57:50,601 --> 00:57:51,699
Goddamn it.

1286
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:56,989
Pu-- Puh-- Put-a-nam roles--

1287
00:57:57,090 --> 00:57:59,025
"Put-a-nam roles"?

1288
00:57:59,125 --> 00:58:00,608
It says, "Putnam rules!"

1289
00:58:03,012 --> 00:58:04,146
Take a lap.

1290
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:07,967
Around the flaping block!

1291
00:58:08,067 --> 00:58:10,552
[man] Yeah, you heard him!
Come on! Let's go! Let's go!

1292
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:17,744
[Hodges] All right.

1293
00:58:17,844 --> 00:58:21,213
It's time to go back
to the beginning. The basics.

1294
00:58:21,313 --> 00:58:23,215
Time to rediscover
what it was about this game

1295
00:58:23,315 --> 00:58:24,951
that made us love it so much.

1296
00:58:25,050 --> 00:58:27,519
Now, we all learned how to play
football on this lawn.

1297
00:58:27,619 --> 00:58:30,889
We would play until it got
so dark we couldn't see anymore.

1298
00:58:30,989 --> 00:58:32,625
Or until our moms called us
for dinner.

1299
00:58:32,724 --> 00:58:35,228
Or until Mr. Vogel
chased us off.

1300
00:58:35,327 --> 00:58:36,829
God rest his soul.

1301
00:58:36,929 --> 00:58:39,065
And parked across the street
every Saturday morning

1302
00:58:39,164 --> 00:58:41,233
like a professional scout,
watching us develop

1303
00:58:41,333 --> 00:58:45,838
our individual skills, was a man
with true spirit, true grit,

1304
00:58:45,938 --> 00:58:48,141
and the smartest mind
in all of football.

1305
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:49,541
[Coach] Whoo-hoo!

1306
00:58:49,641 --> 00:58:51,025
[sighs] Led, would you...

1307
00:58:54,831 --> 00:58:57,684
- Coach, get down from there.
- Make me.

1308
00:58:57,784 --> 00:58:59,918
It was the spirit of Coach
and the love of football

1309
00:59:00,018 --> 00:59:01,253
that brought us together.

1310
00:59:01,353 --> 00:59:03,523
So today,
we're gonna start fresh.

1311
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:05,039
Take a page out of our own past.

1312
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:07,527
Dog pile!

1313
00:59:07,626 --> 00:59:09,210
[men screaming]

1314
00:59:11,181 --> 00:59:12,731
[Mitchell] Get him!

1315
00:59:12,831 --> 00:59:14,115
[slow motion groan]

1316
00:59:15,652 --> 00:59:17,237
[all screaming]

1317
00:59:17,336 --> 00:59:19,320
[slow motion shout]

1318
00:59:22,659 --> 00:59:23,909
[Cammie] Okay, guys.

1319
00:59:24,010 --> 00:59:26,085
You know that I'm really happy
that Sonny's playing

1320
00:59:26,186 --> 00:59:27,782
- in the Turkey Bowl...
- [Dana] Maybe.

1321
00:59:27,882 --> 00:59:29,440
...but he's been
so damn tired lately,

1322
00:59:29,541 --> 00:59:31,018
there's been
a whole lot of foreplay

1323
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:32,237
and not a lot of touchdowns.

1324
00:59:32,336 --> 00:59:33,454
Ooh! You know what you need?

1325
00:59:33,554 --> 00:59:34,554
Here you go.

1326
00:59:34,653 --> 00:59:35,653
Boom.

1327
00:59:35,751 --> 00:59:37,351
- Fresher breath?
- And a fresher tulip

1328
00:59:37,438 --> 00:59:38,958
in your downstairs garden. Okay?

1329
00:59:39,057 --> 00:59:40,425
- Three speeds.
- Oh. Uh-huh.

1330
00:59:40,525 --> 00:59:42,123
Look at it.
You can put it in anything.

1331
00:59:42,224 --> 00:59:43,661
- You can take it anywhere.
- Okay.

1332
00:59:43,762 --> 00:59:45,199
I once did it
in a public restroom.

1333
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:47,032
Oh, all right.
So Mitchell's fully living

1334
00:59:47,132 --> 00:59:48,701
in the garage then, still?

1335
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:50,536
Even when he was living
in the house,

1336
00:59:50,637 --> 00:59:52,153
I was using this.

1337
00:59:52,253 --> 00:59:54,130
Wait, but what do you use
for your toothbrush?

1338
00:59:54,231 --> 00:59:55,231
My giant dildo.

1339
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:57,744
- [both] Jen.
- What?

1340
00:59:57,844 --> 01:00:00,400
- What are you so consumed with?
- I'm just reading an article.

1341
01:00:00,501 --> 01:00:02,248
Oh, okay. Cool.
Let me see that. Cute.

1342
01:00:02,347 --> 01:00:04,449
- Oh.
- Read it.

1343
01:00:04,550 --> 01:00:06,652
Senator Sinclair's sexy,
sultry daughter, Ashley.

1344
01:00:06,753 --> 01:00:08,987
[Dana]
"I'm super airbrushed and rich."

1345
01:00:09,088 --> 01:00:10,088
[gasps]

1346
01:00:10,188 --> 01:00:11,791
You have a lady-boner
for Hodges.

1347
01:00:11,891 --> 01:00:12,891
Hardly.

1348
01:00:12,989 --> 01:00:15,027
Um, I've Googled her 1000 times.
Okay?

1349
01:00:15,128 --> 01:00:17,030
And you are
way more scrumptious.

1350
01:00:17,130 --> 01:00:19,197
- Fully.
- Everyone needs to calm down.

1351
01:00:19,297 --> 01:00:20,666
- He's engaged.
- So?

1352
01:00:20,766 --> 01:00:22,201
Yeah. He's not married yet,
girl.

1353
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:23,898
- [Dana] Oh, shooot.
- [Cammie] Oh, what?

1354
01:00:23,998 --> 01:00:26,195
- [Dana] I almost forgot.
- [Cammie] Oh, that's right.

1355
01:00:26,295 --> 01:00:27,813
[squeals] You're gonna
poop yourself.

1356
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:32,135
- Oh, my God, no. Stop it.
- [Dana] I already got--

1357
01:00:32,235 --> 01:00:34,431
- Where did you get these?
- Dana had 'em made for us!

1358
01:00:34,532 --> 01:00:36,583
- They're so cool!
- I know.

1359
01:00:36,682 --> 01:00:38,851
I know. I'm gonna
shove my whole body in one.

1360
01:00:38,951 --> 01:00:40,518
And when you say "us,"

1361
01:00:40,619 --> 01:00:42,416
you're not including me
in that "us," right?

1362
01:00:42,516 --> 01:00:43,516
- Oh, yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

1363
01:00:43,615 --> 01:00:44,853
No. I already told you guys no.

1364
01:00:44,954 --> 01:00:46,224
- Yes.
- No.

1365
01:00:46,324 --> 01:00:47,675
- Jen.
- No.

1366
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:51,597
Oh, okay. That's fine.
[chuckles] Okay.

1367
01:00:51,697 --> 01:00:53,666
I didn't want to
have to do this.

1368
01:00:53,766 --> 01:00:54,766
- No?
- But I'm gonna.

1369
01:00:54,867 --> 01:00:56,802
I bet you Ashley Sinclair

1370
01:00:56,902 --> 01:00:58,871
wasn't the captain
of her cheer squad

1371
01:00:58,971 --> 01:01:00,255
three years running.

1372
01:01:01,090 --> 01:01:02,724
- Hit it.
- Bloop-bloop.

1373
01:01:03,661 --> 01:01:04,760
[chuckles]

1374
01:01:07,697 --> 01:01:10,048
Okay, the score

01:09:57,927 --> 01:10:00,561
- Was that you?
- Oh, come on.

1546
01:10:01,631 --> 01:10:03,748
Oh, I'm just messing with you.

1547
01:10:03,849 --> 01:10:05,216
[chuckles]

1548
01:10:05,317 --> 01:10:06,967
A girl never forgets her first.

1549
01:10:09,305 --> 01:10:10,505
Or any of them really.

1550
01:10:11,474 --> 01:10:12,690
Some I'd love to forget.

1551
01:10:12,791 --> 01:10:14,292
Yeah, sure.
I got a couple of those.

1552
01:10:14,393 --> 01:10:15,542
[chuckles]

1553
01:10:20,516 --> 01:10:21,849
So does Ashley want kids?

1554
01:10:24,753 --> 01:10:25,753
No.

1555
01:10:27,524 --> 01:10:28,524
That's too bad.

1556
01:10:28,622 --> 01:10:31,592
I always thought
you'd make a wonderful dad.

1557
01:10:32,862 --> 01:10:33,912
Thanks.

1558
01:10:34,012 --> 01:10:37,815
Oh. Well, I guess
that's our cue.

1559
01:10:37,916 --> 01:10:39,434
[both chuckle]

1560
01:10:41,637 --> 01:10:43,570
I just have
one more question for you.

1561
01:10:45,408 --> 01:10:46,408
What's up?

1562
01:10:48,545 --> 01:10:49,895
Was Ashley the, uh...

1563
01:10:49,994 --> 01:10:53,381
captain of her
high school cheer-leading squad?

1564
01:10:54,884 --> 01:10:57,518
No. She went to an
all-girls private school...

1565
01:10:58,520 --> 01:10:59,988
and she hates sports.

1566
01:11:01,824 --> 01:11:02,824
Why?

1567
01:11:03,859 --> 01:11:05,326
Just curious.

1568
01:11:10,466 --> 01:11:11,716
[sprinklers sprays]

1569
01:11:11,817 --> 01:11:13,685
- Oh, great. All right.
- [Jen squeals]

1570
01:11:13,786 --> 01:11:15,720
- [Jen] No!
- [Hodges laughing] God!

1571
01:11:15,819 --> 01:11:18,100
- [Jen] Oh, my God! [laughs]
- [Hodges laughing] Oh, no!

1572
01:11:29,953 --> 01:11:33,572
Jesus, Ronnie, you scared
the hell out of me, man.

1573
01:11:33,671 --> 01:11:34,671
So...

1574
01:11:35,625 --> 01:11:37,376
you have been staying in shape.

1575
01:11:37,475 --> 01:11:38,743
[sighs]

1576
01:11:38,844 --> 01:11:39,881
What the hell do you want?

1577
01:11:39,981 --> 01:11:42,914
Hey. Give that back.
Give it back.

1578
01:11:43,015 --> 01:11:44,092
- Mm-hmm.
- Give it to me.

1579
01:11:44,193 --> 01:11:45,466
Hey, uh-uh!

1580
01:11:46,603 --> 01:11:48,787
I wonder
how your fiancé would feel

1581
01:11:48,886 --> 01:11:51,738
seeing you as Grand Gobble
Marshal tonight...

1582
01:11:53,643 --> 01:11:55,426
moving in on my girl.

1583
01:11:55,527 --> 01:11:57,796
She's not your girl right now,
Ronnie.

1584
01:11:57,895 --> 01:11:59,780
She's not yours, either.

1585
01:12:02,952 --> 01:12:05,470
And what are you doing
with my sister's underwear?

1586
01:12:05,570 --> 01:12:08,673
Wha--
Why don't you just ask her?

1587
01:12:08,774 --> 01:12:10,452
You know what?
And the fact that you know

1588
01:12:10,551 --> 01:12:12,271
that they're hers
is beyond dysfunctional.

1589
01:12:13,997 --> 01:12:15,764
You come into my town

1590
01:12:15,863 --> 01:12:18,020
and think you can just sweep
all the girls in my life

1591
01:12:18,119 --> 01:12:19,119
off their feet?

1592
01:12:20,936 --> 01:12:22,337
You make me sick.

1593
01:12:24,407 --> 01:12:25,490
Ronnie...

1594
01:12:25,591 --> 01:12:27,426
- why are you here?
- What are you?

1595
01:12:27,525 --> 01:12:30,011
You don't even care
about this game.

1596
01:12:32,381 --> 01:12:33,698
Big city hot...

1597
01:12:33,798 --> 01:12:37,869
shooot with a famous
political fiancé.

1598
01:12:37,970 --> 01:12:39,247
You'll be gone tomorrow night...

1599
01:12:39,347 --> 01:12:41,185
- Oh, my God.
- ...while the rest of the town

1600
01:12:41,284 --> 01:12:42,363
gets to pick up the pieces.

1601
01:12:45,694 --> 01:12:47,127
You're a good QB, Hodges.

1602
01:12:49,466 --> 01:12:50,985
[whispers]
Maybe even better than me.

1603
01:12:54,404 --> 01:12:55,887
Did I say that out loud?

1604
01:12:55,988 --> 01:12:56,988
No.

1605
01:12:57,806 --> 01:12:58,806
Good.

1606
01:13:00,409 --> 01:13:01,827
You can't win this game.

1607
01:13:01,926 --> 01:13:03,862
We have a better team.
Always have.

1608
01:13:03,962 --> 01:13:07,765
Put-nam can't survive
another loss to Noble.

1609
01:13:07,865 --> 01:13:09,935
- It's "Putnam."
- Do you really want to see me

1610
01:13:10,034 --> 01:13:11,804
bulldoze the Badger Hole?

1611
01:13:11,904 --> 01:13:14,488
It'll be the final nail
in the coffin for Put-nam.

1612
01:13:15,158 --> 01:13:16,708
A year from now,

1613
01:13:16,809 --> 01:13:19,493
your boys will be begging
to work for my crew.

1614
01:13:20,963 --> 01:13:21,963
Now...

1615
01:13:23,632 --> 01:13:24,931
fear not. [chuckles]

1616
01:13:26,603 --> 01:13:27,734
I'm a businessman.

1617
01:13:29,139 --> 01:13:31,471
The only reason
we're playing this game...

1618
01:13:32,475 --> 01:13:33,908
is 'cause you came back.

1619
01:13:35,578 --> 01:13:37,011
So here's what I propose.

1620
01:13:40,917 --> 01:13:41,917
You...

1621
01:13:43,552 --> 01:13:44,618
fly away.

1622
01:13:49,893 --> 01:13:50,957
And...

1623
01:13:55,597 --> 01:13:56,948
we don't play the game.

1624
01:13:57,048 --> 01:13:58,951
Fat Jack keeps his bar.

1625
01:13:59,051 --> 01:14:01,769
I'll stay on my side
of the tracks.

1626
01:14:03,139 --> 01:14:05,390
Put-nam is spared
from more humiliation

1627
01:14:05,490 --> 01:14:07,675
and can continue to live
in Noble's shadow.

1628
01:14:11,014 --> 01:14:12,014
Yeah.

1629
01:14:15,118 --> 01:14:16,118
Well...

1630
01:14:18,921 --> 01:14:20,921
looks like you've got
some decisions to make.

1631
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:24,625
Your call, QB.

1632
01:14:49,118 --> 01:14:50,118
[Hodges] Oh...

1633
01:14:53,689 --> 01:14:54,689
God.

1634
01:14:58,895 --> 01:15:00,479
<i> And in tracking</i>

1635
01:15:00,578 --> 01:15:02,376

[gasps]

1646
01:15:36,180 --> 01:15:37,682
Is it game time yet?

1647
01:15:37,783 --> 01:15:39,533
No, Coach. Go back to bed.

1648
01:15:40,168 --> 01:15:41,168
Boop.

1649
01:15:42,238 --> 01:15:44,222
[Mitchell] Straight legs
and hold!

1650
01:15:44,323 --> 01:15:45,890
- There he is.
- Hey, hey!

1651
01:15:45,990 --> 01:15:47,525
Nothing like
an early morning jog

1652
01:15:47,626 --> 01:15:49,728
in the crisp Oklahoma air.
Am I right?

1653
01:15:49,828 --> 01:15:51,128
[Mitchell laughs]

1654
01:15:51,229 --> 01:15:53,680
Complements
of my expense account.

1655
01:15:54,117 --> 01:15:55,117
Oh!

1656
01:15:56,085 --> 01:15:58,136
[all cheering] Yeah!

1657
01:15:58,235 --> 01:16:00,072
- [Hodges] Yeah, baby!
- [Sonny D] Yes!

1658
01:16:00,171 --> 01:16:02,140
- [Fish] Whoo!
- [Hodges] Yeah!

1659
01:16:02,239 --> 01:16:03,609
All right, guys.
Last practice...

1660
01:16:03,708 --> 01:16:05,186
- [all] Yeah.
- ...so let's do this!

1661
01:16:05,287 --> 01:16:06,287
[cheering continues]

1662
01:16:11,301 --> 01:16:12,551
- flap this.
- Yeah.

1663
01:16:12,650 --> 01:16:13,667
Take him out.

1664
01:16:14,970 --> 01:16:17,270
- Who? Hodges?
- Yes.

1665
01:16:19,309 --> 01:16:20,675
Take him where?

1666
01:16:22,011 --> 01:16:23,662
Take him out of the game.

1667
01:16:23,761 --> 01:16:25,730
Run him over. Break his arm.

1668
01:16:25,831 --> 01:16:26,965
- I don't care.
- Okay.

1669
01:16:27,064 --> 01:16:29,100
Can't afford to lose this game.

1670
01:16:29,201 --> 01:16:31,351
It'll ruin my rep, my career...

1671
01:16:32,287 --> 01:16:33,671
my slogan.

1672
01:16:33,771 --> 01:16:35,908
Well, yeah.
Just trying to say, you know,

1673
01:16:36,007 --> 01:16:37,842
we've all been practicing really
hard, and--

1674
01:16:37,943 --> 01:16:40,994
Okay, fine.
Fine! Fine. Fine. God!

1675
01:16:42,332 --> 01:16:43,698
I'll do it myself.

1676
01:16:44,766 --> 01:16:46,551
I mean, isn't there another way?

1677
01:16:46,652 --> 01:16:48,769
Your plan seems pretty mean.

1678
01:16:54,277 --> 01:16:55,277
You're fired.

1679
01:16:56,345 --> 01:16:57,828
Ronnie, you can't fire me.

1680
01:16:57,929 --> 01:17:00,230
I have a kid with special needs.

1681
01:17:00,331 --> 01:17:02,682
You'd better add hunger
to that list of special needs.

1682
01:17:13,962 --> 01:17:15,581
- Hello!
- [Sonny D] Hodges!

1683
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:17,315
- Hey!
- What's up?

1684
01:17:17,416 --> 01:17:18,854
Oh, man,
this place looks the same.

1685
01:17:18,953 --> 01:17:20,470
- What's going on?
- What's up, guys?

1686
01:17:20,570 --> 01:17:22,167
The rental car company
tried to ship it

1687
01:17:22,268 --> 01:17:24,065
to its rightful owner,
but I intercepted it.

1688
01:17:24,407 --> 01:17:26,358
Oh, shooot! Thank you, dude.

1689
01:17:26,457 --> 01:17:29,661
Boys, it's time for our
night-before tradition.

1690
01:17:29,761 --> 01:17:31,896
- Yeah!
- Buddy...

1691
01:17:31,997 --> 01:17:34,472
- it's good to have you back.
- Thanks, buddy. You know what?

1692
01:17:34,573 --> 01:17:36,649
- It's good to be back.
- Oh, it's good to be back?

1693
01:17:36,748 --> 01:17:38,466
- [all] Yeah, yeah!
- [indistinct chatter]

1694
01:17:38,565 --> 01:17:40,162
Hodges, your parents still out
of town?

1695
01:17:41,791 --> 01:17:42,823
Yeah, why?

1696
01:17:53,970 --> 01:17:55,301
[Ronnie groans] shooot.

1697
01:18:00,109 --> 01:18:02,661
[Ronnie] Okay.
You want to see mean?

1698
01:18:02,761 --> 01:18:05,112
[panting] I'll show you mean.

1699
01:18:10,086 --> 01:18:11,286
[thud]

1700
01:18:11,953 --> 01:18:13,554
[grunts]

1701
01:18:19,362 --> 01:18:21,846
[grunts, groans]

1702
01:18:21,947 --> 01:18:23,430
[panting]

1703
01:18:29,706 --> 01:18:30,921
Taste the heat.

1704
01:18:31,021 --> 01:18:32,305
[flame whooshes]

1705
01:18:41,283 --> 01:18:44,318
No. Oh! Oh, shooot!

1706
01:18:45,121 --> 01:18:46,238
Oh, shooot.

1707
01:18:46,337 --> 01:18:50,056
[groans] It wasn't me.
It wasn't me.

1708
01:18:51,493 --> 01:18:53,461
Oh! [pants]

1709
01:18:59,034 --> 01:19:00,333
[engine starts]

1710
01:19:02,404 --> 01:19:04,037
- Damn it.
- [truck beeping]

1711
01:19:06,775 --> 01:19:08,309
[engine revving]

1712
01:19:09,779 --> 01:19:10,779
shooot.

1713
01:19:14,951 --> 01:19:16,984
Noble Knights win their fights.

1714
01:19:23,091 --> 01:19:25,091
[creaking]

1715
01:19:29,231 --> 01:19:30,965
[electricity crackles]

1716
01:19:31,868 --> 01:19:33,851
[all] Let's go Badgers!

1717
01:19:33,952 --> 01:19:36,154
- [screams] Yeah!
- I got it right this time!

1718
01:19:36,253 --> 01:19:37,253
[Dana] You did.

1719
01:19:37,353 --> 01:19:39,030
- [Dana] Oh. Wow.
- What time do you guys

1720
01:19:39,131 --> 01:19:40,168
want to be there tomorrow?

1721
01:19:40,269 --> 01:19:41,269
Uh, that depends.

1722
01:19:41,368 --> 01:19:43,543
- On what?
- On how hungover we are.

1723
01:19:44,113 --> 01:19:45,113
Why?

1724
01:19:46,346 --> 01:19:48,703
- Because there's a pep rally...
- [all] At Hodges' house!

1725
01:19:48,804 --> 01:19:49,967
[all screaming]

1726
01:19:50,068 --> 01:19:55,806
<i> ♪ I've never had</i>
<i> To knock on wood ♪</i>

1727
01:19:55,907 --> 01:19:58,275
<i> ♪ But I know someone... ♪</i>

1728
01:19:58,376 --> 01:20:00,795
Guys, just be cool in the house,
okay? Careful. Jesus.

1729
01:20:02,798 --> 01:20:04,149
Hey, Coach, how you doing?

1730
01:20:04,248 --> 01:20:07,319
Everything good? Hi.
Good to see you.

1731
01:20:07,418 --> 01:20:10,756
All right. Well, holler
if you need anything, okay?

1732
01:20:10,855 --> 01:20:12,773
- [man] Shotgun!
- Hey, wait, wait, wait, guys.

1733
01:20:12,872 --> 01:20:13,974
Can you please...

1734
01:20:15,411 --> 01:20:17,162
do that outside?

1735
01:20:17,261 --> 01:20:19,313
[people screaming]

1736
01:20:20,515 --> 01:20:21,932
Hey, where you going?

1737
01:20:22,033 --> 01:20:24,034
- Where you going?
- I'm gonna sing.

1738
01:20:24,135 --> 01:20:25,152
[sighs]

1739
01:20:30,926 --> 01:20:32,243
God damn it, Ronnie.

1740
01:20:32,344 --> 01:20:35,247
Same blood, different body.

1741
01:20:35,346 --> 01:20:37,314
Oh, shooot, Brandy. Come on.

1742
01:20:37,414 --> 01:20:39,083
I am so jealous.

1743
01:20:39,184 --> 01:20:41,819
Looks like you got
some decisions to make.

1744
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:43,837
Brandy, take that off.

1745
01:20:45,373 --> 01:20:46,373
Okay.

1746
01:20:46,472 --> 01:20:48,527
No-- no-- I meant the ring.

1747
01:20:48,627 --> 01:20:50,423
You can't just get naked
without my consent.

1748
01:20:50,524 --> 01:20:51,930
It's like a--
That's like a thing.

1749
01:20:52,029 --> 01:20:53,587
Can you just give me the ring,
please?

1750
01:20:53,686 --> 01:20:55,515
Well, you gonna have
to come get it.

1751
01:20:56,452 --> 01:20:57,518
Oh, God.

1752
01:21:00,590 --> 01:21:03,157
Stop undressing me
with your eyes.

1753
01:21:06,362 --> 01:21:07,546
Eighty-eight?

1754
01:21:07,645 --> 01:21:09,814
I mean,
I couldn't wear just one.

1755
01:21:09,914 --> 01:21:10,981
That would be trashy.

1756
01:21:11,082 --> 01:21:13,018
Damn it. Brandy,
just give me the-- shooot.

1757
01:21:13,118 --> 01:21:15,353
I have waited for this moment...

1758
01:21:15,453 --> 01:21:16,555
- Just--
- ...for years.

1759
01:21:16,654 --> 01:21:18,422
- It's stuck. I can't...
- [Brandy moans]

1760
01:21:18,523 --> 01:21:19,841
- ...pull it.
- [Brandy] Harder.

1761
01:21:19,940 --> 01:21:21,408
- [Hodges] Ow!
- Harder.

1762
01:21:21,507 --> 01:21:23,823
- [Hodges] Just-- [groans]
- Take me you dirty bird, you!

1763
01:21:23,923 --> 01:21:25,282
- [groans] shooot.
- [Brandy moans]

1764
01:21:25,381 --> 01:21:27,219
Just stay still and relax.
I'll do it myself!

1765
01:21:27,319 --> 01:21:28,636
- [Brandy moans]
- [Jen] Hodges?

1766
01:21:28,737 --> 01:21:30,868
- Oh, my God.
- Woah!

1767
01:21:30,969 --> 01:21:32,304
- Hey, Jen.
- [groans]

1768
01:21:32,404 --> 01:21:33,872
You ever heard
of knocking, bitch?

1769
01:21:33,971 --> 01:21:35,329
This is not
what you think it is.

1770
01:21:35,430 --> 01:21:37,341
- Yes, it is.
- It's okay. I don't care.

1771
01:21:37,442 --> 01:21:39,310
- It's okay. She doesn't care.
- No--

1772
01:21:39,411 --> 01:21:41,368
I just came by to say
have a good game tomorrow.

1773
01:21:41,469 --> 01:21:43,148
- Thank you, Jen.
- No, no, no, get off.

1774
01:21:43,247 --> 01:21:44,850
- No, no...
- [Hodges] Jen.

1775
01:21:44,949 --> 01:21:46,033
...Pitter Pat.

1776
01:21:46,636 --> 01:21:49,487
Jen. Wait. Jen, wait!

1777
01:21:49,587 --> 01:21:51,288
Whatever. It's okay.
I don't care.

1778
01:21:51,389 --> 01:21:52,890
No. I can explain.

1779
01:21:52,990 --> 01:21:54,458
Nothing happened.
I swear to God.

1780
01:21:54,559 --> 01:21:55,594
Right. Yeah.

1781
01:21:55,694 --> 01:21:57,895
Just like Lake Dirtybird.

1782
01:21:57,996 --> 01:21:59,230
[sighs]

1783
01:21:59,331 --> 01:22:01,565
Whatever. It--
I don't even know why I'm upset.

1784
01:22:01,666 --> 01:22:03,902
We're not even--
It doesn't matter.

1785
01:22:04,002 --> 01:22:05,685
Look, it does matter...

1786
01:22:06,421 --> 01:22:07,421
'cause...

1787
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:09,541
goddamn it, this town...
[groans]

1788
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:11,509
...just flaping brings out
the worst in me.

1789
01:22:11,609 --> 01:22:14,546
What am I even doing?
I should be in a cabin in Vail

1790
01:22:14,645 --> 01:22:16,413
sipping hot toddies
with my fiancé

1791
01:22:16,514 --> 01:22:18,884
and the future president,
but no, uh. Here I am,

1792
01:22:18,984 --> 01:22:20,621
running around
like I'm flaping bonkers.

1793
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:22,887
Ashley is not here with me

1794
01:22:22,988 --> 01:22:25,090
because, well, one,
she hates it here,

1795
01:22:25,189 --> 01:22:27,641
and I don't blame her.

1796
01:22:27,742 --> 01:22:30,194
And two, because I lied to her
about Mitchell's death.

1797
01:22:30,295 --> 01:22:32,029
I did.
She has no idea

1798
01:22:32,130 --> 01:22:33,646
that I threw Ronnie
through a window,

1799
01:22:33,747 --> 01:22:35,199
got arrested.
And for my sentence,

1800
01:22:35,300 --> 01:22:37,636
I am stuck here
finishing the '99 Turkey Bowl

1801
01:22:37,735 --> 01:22:40,204
with a bunch of fat drunks.
And the worst part,

1802
01:22:40,305 --> 01:22:42,221
I'm upstairs rolling around
with escort Barbie,

1803
01:22:42,322 --> 01:22:44,042
chasing my ex-high school
girlfriend

1804
01:22:44,141 --> 01:22:46,077
across my parents' lawn,

1805
01:22:46,176 --> 01:22:48,332
trying to explain to her
that I'm not cheating on her

1806
01:22:48,432 --> 01:22:51,398
because I may still kind of
be in love with her.

1807
01:22:52,667 --> 01:22:54,152
[all] Aww.

1808
01:22:54,252 --> 01:22:55,850
- I called that, babe.
- You did, babe.

1809
01:22:55,949 --> 01:22:57,188
- I called it.
- You did good.

1810
01:22:57,287 --> 01:22:58,287
Oh, my God!

1811
01:22:58,386 --> 01:23:00,145
See, this is exactly
why I've been avoiding

1812
01:23:00,244 --> 01:23:01,603
this place
for the last 15 years.

1813
01:23:01,703 --> 01:23:03,543
It's flaping high school
all over again.

1814
01:23:05,715 --> 01:23:07,146
You just left...

1815
01:23:08,384 --> 01:23:09,984
without even saying goodbye.

1816
01:23:11,420 --> 01:23:13,505
I called you,
like, a hundred times.

1817
01:23:13,604 --> 01:23:14,972
Well, we were fighting.

1818
01:23:15,073 --> 01:23:17,309
You didn't-- You didn't answer.

1819
01:23:17,408 --> 01:23:19,086
Well, just 'cause
I wasn't talking to you

1820
01:23:19,185 --> 01:23:20,823
didn't mean
that it was over between us.

1821
01:23:21,630 --> 01:23:23,296
How was I supposed to know that?

1822
01:23:25,368 --> 01:23:27,667
No, you don't just leave
the ones you love.

1823
01:23:30,439 --> 01:23:32,238
Well, hey, now--
now you're doing it.

1824
01:23:34,010 --> 01:23:36,127
- Have a good game, Hodges.
- Well, wha--

1825
01:23:36,226 --> 01:23:39,296
Jen, hey.
Come on, we could...

1826
01:23:39,396 --> 01:23:40,396
[engine starts]

1827
01:23:41,216 --> 01:23:42,216
flap.

1828
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:46,520
Glenn.

1829
01:23:47,270 --> 01:23:49,466
No, no, no. Hey, this is totally
out of context, okay?

1830
01:23:49,567 --> 01:23:50,926
Glenn,
you don't understand, man.

1831
01:23:51,793 --> 01:23:54,479
Are you coming back to bed,
Hodges?

1832
01:23:54,578 --> 01:23:56,314
flap! Wait, wait, wait!

1833
01:23:56,413 --> 01:23:58,716
Hey! flap! Just--

1834
01:23:58,817 --> 01:23:59,984
- Hey, dude?
- What?

1835
01:24:00,085 --> 01:24:01,563
There's some people
here to see you.

1836
01:24:01,662 --> 01:24:03,188
Who the flap is it now?

1837
01:24:03,287 --> 01:24:04,505
Your flaping parents.

1838
01:24:06,775 --> 01:24:08,460
Mom. Dad. Hey.

1839
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:11,029
Back early, huh?
How was the...

1840
01:24:11,128 --> 01:24:13,680
- gout?
- Judge Tibbins called.

1841
01:24:14,682 --> 01:24:16,067
He thought you and the boys

1842
01:24:16,167 --> 01:24:17,601
might be resting
for the big game,

1843
01:24:17,702 --> 01:24:21,271
and I specifically asked
for no funny business.

1844
01:24:21,372 --> 01:24:24,074
Yeah. No, just a couple
of close friends hanging.

1845
01:24:24,175 --> 01:24:25,426
- [man] Heads up!
- Hey.

1846
01:24:31,132 --> 01:24:32,751
I'm disappointed in you, Son.

1847
01:24:32,850 --> 01:24:34,252
This is no way for a...

1848
01:24:34,351 --> 01:24:36,837
Grand Gobble Marshal to behave.

1849
01:24:38,106 --> 01:24:39,524
Please ask your friends
to leave.

1850
01:24:39,623 --> 01:24:41,559
Call me later, alligator.

1851
01:24:41,658 --> 01:24:45,029
I want you to go to your room,
Patrick Hodges.

1852
01:24:45,130 --> 01:24:46,287
Think about what you've done.

1853
01:24:46,387 --> 01:24:47,731
You are grounded.

1854
01:24:47,832 --> 01:24:50,617
- What?
- You heard your mother.

1855
01:24:51,787 --> 01:24:54,822
Oh, come on!
God, this is so stupid.

1856
01:24:55,457 --> 01:24:57,123
Son of a bitch!

1857
01:25:01,863 --> 01:25:03,130
[sighs]

1858
01:25:08,804 --> 01:25:10,369
What the flap am I doing here?

1859
01:25:18,413 --> 01:25:19,779
Ah, damn it, Fish?

1860
01:25:26,488 --> 01:25:27,488
Hey, man.

1861
01:25:28,724 --> 01:25:30,574
I had a feeling
you might bail...

1862
01:25:30,675 --> 01:25:31,875
again.

1863
01:25:32,458 --> 01:25:34,815
Look, bro, you're the one
that brought me back here, okay?

1864
01:25:34,916 --> 01:25:35,916
I didn't want to come.

1865
01:25:36,015 --> 01:25:38,131
- Couldn't you get the hint?
- Yeah, I got the hint.

1866
01:25:38,231 --> 01:25:39,231
I chose to ignore it.

1867
01:25:40,802 --> 01:25:42,840
When'd you start thinking
you were better than us?

1868
01:25:42,939 --> 01:25:45,457
Jen was right.
You-- you just left.

1869
01:25:45,556 --> 01:25:47,524
No goodbye. No nothing.

1870
01:25:47,625 --> 01:25:49,426
Well, I don't know, okay? I--

1871
01:25:49,527 --> 01:25:51,362
Maybe it's
just too much pressure...

1872
01:25:51,462 --> 01:25:52,942
or something. I don't know.
Maybe...

1873
01:25:53,782 --> 01:25:55,215
I just didn't want
to be that guy.

1874
01:25:56,252 --> 01:25:57,868
- What guy?
- That loser QB

1875
01:25:57,969 --> 01:25:59,737
who-- who stays
in his hometown,

1876
01:25:59,837 --> 01:26:02,506
you know, always talks
about the game that almost was,

1877
01:26:02,606 --> 01:26:05,109
you know, gets a beer belly,
never amounts to anything.

1878
01:26:05,210 --> 01:26:06,489
I just didn't want to be like...

1879
01:26:08,396 --> 01:26:09,496
Like me?

1880
01:26:12,801 --> 01:26:14,519
Look, I might not be a made-man.

1881
01:26:14,618 --> 01:26:17,588
I might not be rich and have
a fancy job, but I like my life.

1882
01:26:17,689 --> 01:26:20,340
Do you know why
I put this whole thing together?

1883
01:26:21,476 --> 01:26:22,537
The game doesn't matter.

1884
01:26:22,636 --> 01:26:24,074
I just wanted
to hang out with you.

1885
01:26:24,175 --> 01:26:25,813
I wanted you to throw me
the ball again.

1886
01:26:25,912 --> 01:26:26,912
I flaping missed you.

1887
01:26:27,011 --> 01:26:29,091
- Come on, man. I missed you too.
- No, you didn't.

1888
01:26:31,453 --> 01:26:33,369
What happened to us?
We used to be inseparable.

1889
01:26:33,470 --> 01:26:34,470
Then you just left.

1890
01:26:34,569 --> 01:26:36,440
You didn't call.
You didn't write.

1891
01:26:36,541 --> 01:26:38,243
You didn't make
any effort at all.

1892
01:26:38,342 --> 01:26:39,943
I know
you're not my girlfriend, but...

1893
01:26:40,462 --> 01:26:41,694
you flaping broke my heart.

1894
01:26:44,567 --> 01:26:45,649
You were gonna get married,

1895
01:26:45,748 --> 01:26:47,186
and you weren't even
gonna tell me.

1896
01:26:47,287 --> 01:26:48,702
What's wrong with you?

1897
01:26:48,801 --> 01:26:50,759
What's wrong with me?
You're not even my friend.

1898
01:26:50,859 --> 01:26:52,872
I had to fake my death
for you to come back.

1899
01:26:55,211 --> 01:26:56,327
You know what? Just--

1900
01:26:56,426 --> 01:26:59,264
It was a joke,
but act like it was real.

1901
01:26:59,363 --> 01:27:01,832
Consider me dead.
Have a nice life.

1902
01:27:01,932 --> 01:27:04,234
- Mitchell, come on.
- [Mitchell] flap off.

1903
01:27:04,335 --> 01:27:05,418
[Hodges sighs]

1904
01:27:08,356 --> 01:27:09,707
[car door opens]

1905
01:27:09,806 --> 01:27:11,490
- [Hodges sighs]
- [car door closes]

1906
01:27:11,993 --> 01:27:13,359
[engine starts]

1907
01:27:18,634 --> 01:27:19,634
[sighs]

1908
01:27:23,605 --> 01:27:24,904
Is it game time yet?

1909
01:27:26,408 --> 01:27:27,541
Yes, Coach.

1910
01:27:28,743 --> 01:27:29,876
It's game time.

1911
01:27:38,287 --> 01:27:40,844
[answerphone]<i> Hey, it's Ashley.</i>
<i>Just do your thing at the beep.</i>

1912
01:27:40,944 --> 01:27:41,944
[beeps]

1913
01:27:42,042 --> 01:27:43,942
Hey, babe. Uh, left you
a couple voicemails,

1914
01:27:44,042 --> 01:27:46,476
and you know, no one's
picking up on the cabin phone,

1915
01:27:46,577 --> 01:27:47,577
but, um...

1916
01:27:47,676 --> 01:27:49,479
I'm heading out to see you.

1917
01:27:49,579 --> 01:27:50,579
Yay!

1918
01:27:51,734 --> 01:27:53,751
I don't know
if you talked to Glenn,

1919
01:27:53,850 --> 01:27:55,690
but, uh-- Hey, call me
if you get this, okay?

1920
01:27:56,305 --> 01:27:57,305
All right.

1921
01:28:03,378 --> 01:28:04,444
[scoffs]

1922
01:28:13,988 --> 01:28:15,389
[sighs]

1923
01:28:26,902 --> 01:28:28,658
[men chanting]
I'd rather be dead than red!

1924
01:28:28,759 --> 01:28:30,354
I'd rather be dead than red!

1925
01:28:30,454 --> 01:28:33,524
I'd rather be dead than red!
I'd rather be dead than red!

1926
01:28:33,623 --> 01:28:35,292
I'd rather be dead than red!

1927
01:28:35,393 --> 01:28:37,029
[Sonny D] Oh, God.
What are we gonna do?

1928
01:28:37,130 --> 01:28:39,407
- [Cherokee] Honestly, I don't...
- [dialog overlapping]

1929
01:28:39,506 --> 01:28:41,783
[all chanting] ...than red!
I'd rather be dead than red!

1930
01:28:41,884 --> 01:28:43,362
[Sonny D] shooot,
what are we gonna...

1931
01:28:43,462 --> 01:28:45,738
[all chanting] ...than red!
I'd rather be dead than red!

1932
01:28:45,837 --> 01:28:48,034
- [Ronnie] Let's do this, boys!
- You shut your damn--

1933
01:28:48,135 --> 01:28:51,609
- Shut the--
- Guys! Everybody calm down!

1934
01:28:51,708 --> 01:28:53,511
We can't win this
without Hodges.

1935
01:28:53,610 --> 01:28:55,862
- Fuckin' A, we can!
- W-- what are we gonna do?

1936
01:28:57,498 --> 01:28:59,350
I'll play QB.
We'll stick to the run.

1937
01:28:59,449 --> 01:29:00,618
No passing. We can do it.

1938
01:29:00,717 --> 01:29:02,555
I can't believe this,
after everything we did

1939
01:29:02,654 --> 01:29:04,572
to get him back here
and make him feel welcome.

1940
01:29:04,671 --> 01:29:05,829
Guys, we have a game to play.

1941
01:29:05,930 --> 01:29:07,690
Any minute Coach will show up,

1942
01:29:07,791 --> 01:29:10,268
he'll give us his famous speech,
and everything will be fine.

1943
01:29:10,368 --> 01:29:12,005
- [police siren wails]
- [tires screech]

1944
01:29:12,381 --> 01:29:13,698
Coach is missing.

1945
01:29:13,797 --> 01:29:16,115
Goddamn it! [groans]

1946
01:29:17,685 --> 01:29:18,703
Did you check the field?

1947
01:29:18,802 --> 01:29:20,554
Stadium, stat. Let's go.

1948
01:29:21,590 --> 01:29:22,922
[Mitchell] Get in the van!

1949
01:29:24,025 --> 01:29:25,376
[man screams]

1950
01:29:25,475 --> 01:29:26,693
[Fat Jack] Come on.

1951
01:29:28,764 --> 01:29:30,130
Hope Coach wasn't around here.

1952
01:29:36,704 --> 01:29:38,971
No human remains.
So, uh, we're good.

1953
01:29:40,109 --> 01:29:42,859
Sorry. We, uh,
did all we could, boys.

1954
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:44,037
Do you know what caused it?

1955
01:29:44,137 --> 01:29:47,780
It's more like "who caused it".
We're looking for leads.

1956
01:29:48,951 --> 01:29:50,751
I think your leads
just got here.

1957
01:29:54,422 --> 01:29:55,939
Well, well, well.

1958
01:29:56,039 --> 01:29:57,039
Oh, my God.

1959
01:29:57,926 --> 01:29:59,711
That's so much damage.

1960
01:29:59,810 --> 01:30:01,746
- [Mitchell] You motherfucker!
- [Ronnie] Hey!

1961
01:30:01,845 --> 01:30:03,613
- [overlapping chatter]
- [all screaming]

1962
01:30:03,713 --> 01:30:04,713

1965
01:30:09,953 --> 01:30:12,390
What the hell is going on here?

1966
01:30:12,489 --> 01:30:14,759
Ronnie Best
burned down the field!

1967
01:30:14,859 --> 01:30:16,127
Bullshit. Did not.

1968
01:30:16,226 --> 01:30:18,578
Yes, you did, and you know it!

1969
01:30:19,747 --> 01:30:21,131
- Prove it.
- [men clamoring]

1970
01:30:21,231 --> 01:30:23,182
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna prove it!

1971
01:30:23,918 --> 01:30:25,185
Just settle down.

1972
01:30:27,989 --> 01:30:29,606
Yes, this is a tragedy.

1973
01:30:29,707 --> 01:30:32,009
However, we've got
some decisions to make.

1974
01:30:32,109 --> 01:30:34,560
I want a word
with the team captains.

1975
01:30:35,530 --> 01:30:37,697
Hodges, Best, step up.

1976
01:30:38,766 --> 01:30:40,451
Hodges left.
I'm captain now.

1977
01:30:40,551 --> 01:30:42,569
- Hodges left?
- Yeah.

1978
01:30:43,604 --> 01:30:44,788
That's disappointing.

1979
01:30:44,889 --> 01:30:46,591
Hodges skipped town, huh?

1980
01:30:46,690 --> 01:30:49,576
[scoffs] What a surprise.

1981
01:30:50,746 --> 01:30:52,796
So no equipment, no stadium,

1982
01:30:52,896 --> 01:30:55,148
- no quarterback?
- No coach.

1983
01:30:58,220 --> 01:31:00,086
Looks like the writing's
on the wall.

1984
01:31:01,189 --> 01:31:02,873
Put-nam High
is gonna have to forfeit.

1985
01:31:02,974 --> 01:31:04,056
It's Putnam.

1986
01:31:06,694 --> 01:31:07,912
Noble High wins!

1987
01:31:08,011 --> 01:31:09,011
Yeah!

1988
01:31:10,247 --> 01:31:13,717
- Does Putnam High forfeit?
- Hell no, we don't!

1989
01:31:13,818 --> 01:31:15,702
- Hell no!
- Okay.

1990
01:31:16,704 --> 01:31:18,890
There's no equipment
for Putnam High.

1991
01:31:18,989 --> 01:31:20,123
We'll play without pads.

1992
01:31:20,224 --> 01:31:21,224
Yeah!

1993
01:31:22,627 --> 01:31:24,543
Will Noble High
play without equipment?

1994
01:31:26,515 --> 01:31:28,273
- Hell yeah, we will!
- [player] flap yeah!

1995
01:31:28,372 --> 01:31:30,067
- Yeah!
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1996
01:31:30,167 --> 01:31:33,069
Whoa, whoa, whoa. It looks like,
uh, Connie Best here,

1997
01:31:33,170 --> 01:31:34,738
looks like she's backing down.

1998
01:31:34,838 --> 01:31:36,740
- [Mitchell] Huh? Ooh. Ooh.
- [all] Aww.

1999
01:31:36,841 --> 01:31:39,010
flap, no, I'm not backing down.
Let's go.

2000
01:31:39,109 --> 01:31:41,078
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

2001
01:31:41,177 --> 01:31:43,029
All right. All right. All right.

2002
01:31:43,966 --> 01:31:45,832
Now all we need is a home field.

2003
01:31:47,802 --> 01:31:49,002
Right.

2004
01:31:54,042 --> 01:31:56,194
- Hello, Mrs. Vogel.
- Hello, Mitchell.

2005
01:31:56,293 --> 01:31:57,828
Did I forget to pay you
this month?

2006
01:31:57,929 --> 01:31:59,167
No, ma'am, I was just wondering

2007
01:31:59,266 --> 01:32:01,144
if we could play a football game
on your lawn.

2008
01:32:01,243 --> 01:32:02,641
- Of course. I don't mind.
- Okay.

2009
01:32:02,742 --> 01:32:06,537
Well, there's just
a few more people than usual.

2010
01:32:06,636 --> 01:32:09,506
Oh? How many more people
are we talking about here?

2011
01:32:09,606 --> 01:32:10,606
Uh...

2012
01:32:14,563 --> 01:32:15,563
I see.

2013
01:32:16,265 --> 01:32:18,649
Well, just watch the plants.

2014
01:32:18,748 --> 01:32:19,748
Okay.

2016
01:32:29,578 --> 01:32:31,043
Thank you. [sighs]

01:32:42,957 --> 01:32:44,056
Oh, no.

2018
01:32:46,127 --> 01:32:47,761
No, no, no, no, no.

2019
01:32:51,733 --> 01:32:52,733

Hell no, Ronnie!
I'm gonna beat your ass!

2076

2077
01:36:23,444 --> 01:36:24,828
That hurt.

Come on. Come on.

2079
01:36:26,497 --> 01:36:29,166

Okay, guys.
We learned something there.

2082
01:36:34,070 --> 01:36:35,627
That we're gonna
get our asses kicked?

2083
01:36:35,728 --> 01:36:37,126
No. That we need
to pass the ball.

2084
01:36:37,225 --> 01:36:38,442
How? We don't have Hodges.

2085
01:36:38,542 --> 01:36:40,243
I'll get you the ball.
Just get open.

2086
01:36:40,344 --> 01:36:41,511
Anyone. Anyone get open.

2087
01:36:41,612 --> 01:36:45,115
Come on, guys.
It's been one flaping play.

2088
01:36:45,216 --> 01:36:46,613
The universe is giving us
a chance

2089
01:36:46,713 --> 01:36:48,668
to finish the game
we never did.

2090
01:36:48,769 --> 01:36:51,126
We're playing the Turkey Bowl

Fourth quarter.
How's everybody doing?

2131
01:39:34,451 --> 01:39:37,087
Pupils are dilated. Super dizzy.

2132
01:39:37,186 --> 01:39:39,323
They're like 20 dudes deep
on the bench, man.

2133
01:39:39,422 --> 01:39:40,690
My knee hurts.

2134
01:39:40,791 --> 01:39:42,041
My back hurts.

2135
01:39:42,609 --> 01:39:44,793
My feelings hurt.

2136
01:39:44,894 --> 01:39:47,291
Will you guys stop complaining?
I'm sick of motivating you.

2137
01:39:47,390 --> 01:39:48,390
I'm out of speeches.

2138
01:39:48,750 --> 01:39:50,350
I'm tired, too.

2139
01:39:53,154 --> 01:39:54,487

[Mitchell] What are you
doing here?

2147
01:40:20,952 --> 01:40:22,632
- Did your flight get cancelled?
- Nope.

2148
01:40:22,733 --> 01:40:24,893
I brought you guys something
I thought you could use.

2149
01:40:25,220 --> 01:40:27,136
It's game time, boys!

Yeah!

2154
01:40:39,367 --> 01:40:41,417

Thanks.

2156
01:40:42,617 --> 01:40:45,622
Hey, uh. Well, I know
I'm not your girlfriend,

2157
01:40:45,721 --> 01:40:47,490
but I'm sorry
for breaking your heart,

2158
01:40:47,591 --> 01:40:49,509
and I hope to be
your friend again.

2159
01:40:50,744 --> 01:40:52,677
Help us win this game,
I'll think about it.

Oh, no. [chuckles]
Uh-uh! Uh-uh.

2162
01:41:02,506 --> 01:41:04,274
He's late. He can't play.

2163
01:41:04,373 --> 01:41:06,331
There's nothing in the rulebook
about tardiness.

2164
01:41:06,430 --> 01:41:07,511
Let's play football.

2165
01:41:07,610 --> 01:41:08,610

What?

2171
01:41:21,208 --> 01:41:23,327
Not too smart for a city boy.

2172
01:41:23,426 --> 01:41:24,795
Now let's play some football!

2173
01:41:24,895 --> 01:41:25,895

2174
01:41:26,329 --> 01:41:28,131

All right, gentlemen.

Fourth quarter, down by 14,

2178
01:41:35,305 --> 01:41:37,739
Deja vu, right?

2179
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:40,275
All right, we got one option
and one option only. To win.

2180
01:41:40,376 --> 01:41:42,145

You sure you don't want
to kick it and tie the game?

2217
01:44:25,509 --> 01:44:27,466
No. We didn't come all this way
to play it safe.

2218
01:44:27,567 --> 01:44:29,164
