2
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,160
Cut his ass.

3
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,400
Go! Now let's go!

4
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,600
Heads up!

5
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,360
Take him down!
That's it, that's it!

6
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,400
- Hey, Coach, how you been?
- Lynn Swann.

7
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,360
Now why ain't I surprised...

8
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,240
to see you snoopin' around my
football field first day of practice?

9
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,120
Well, that's because you got
a good-lookin' football team.

10
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,680
Maybe good enough to add another
national championship trophy
to the old case downstairs.

11
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,600
That's kinda like my old man
told me one time, Lynn.

12
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:28,200
"The only thing better than a crawfish
dinner is five crawfish dinners."

13
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,360
Hey, here comes
the shithead.

14
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,000
It's clean.

15
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,280
It's cold.

16
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,720
Now that's what I call
high-quality H2O. Oh!

17
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,600
Ooh!
Right in the head!

18
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,240
It's over there!

19
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:21,400
Any unused magic in that
legendary green playbook of yours, Red?

20
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,440
I may have a couple
squirrelled away in there...

21
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,200
for a rainy day.

22
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,160
See what we got here.

23
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:57,120
Not exactly what I'd call
constructive criticism.

24
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,640
- Smell like you could use
a shower, stinky.
- Oh!

25
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,000
Listen, you-you could think what you
want a-about my personal hygiene,

26
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,080
but, please,
don't-don't waste any water.

27
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,920
That-That's bad policy. If you
need to amuse yourself at my expense,

28
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,640
just-just rough me up
or something.

29
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,320
Fair enough.

30
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,160
Laski, get over here!

31
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,520
Yes, sir, Coach?

32
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,760
What is that moron
doin' here? Huh, huh?

33
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,640
Didn't I tell you as plain as I could
speak to get rid of his ass last year?

34
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,280
Yes, sir, but I didn't think
you were serious, Coach.
Besides, he does a great job.

35
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,240
Disrupting my football team,
you idiot?

36
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,640
Eighteen years of this
is enough!

37
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,120
Hey, Waterboy!

38
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,040
Yes, Mr. Coach Beaulieu!

39
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,440
You're fired!

40
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,360
Okay.

41
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,160
Get out of the way, you moron!

42
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,240
Oh.

43
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,600
Bobby Boucher,
come give your mama a kiss.

44
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,120
Hi, Steve.

45
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,280
Oh. Why you home so early,
my precious angel?

46
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,760
Mama, s-somethin' bad
happened today.

47
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,480
Somebody hurt you, my boy? Who hurt
you? You tell Mama who hurt you.

48
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,400
Nobody, Mama.
It's just that...

49
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,360
I lost my position as the team's
water distribution engineer.

50
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,840
Why, that's the best news
I heard in a dog's age.

51
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,960
Now you be able to spend your days
at home where you belong.

52
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,360
Yes, but...

53
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,720
I-I was... I was thinkin', Mama,
maybe I-I could...

54
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,680
I could try to-to get another
waterboy job for-for a different team.

55
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,040
Don't you raise your voice
to me, Bobby Boucher.

56
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,840
I-I wasn't raising
my voice, Mama.

57
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,640
I don't like confrontation
'cause I'm a Virgo.

58
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,600
Who told you
you was a Virgo?

59
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,400
Vicki Vallencourt,
that-that-that-that girl.

60
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,320
A girl?

61
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,280
Bobby Boucher! Don't you remember
what your mama told you about girls?

62
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,200
I remember, Mama.

63
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,480
A girl was so nice out at
Wasser's Creek this morning.

64
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,200
- Really?
- We looked for crawfish together.
Her's name's Vicki.

65
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,720
I don't ever want you
associatin' with little girls.

66
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,760
- Why not, Mama?
- Because little girls are the devil!

67
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,640
Mama, it-it's just
that I'm a waterboy.

68
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,800
The team gets thirsty,
and I bring them the water.

69
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,520
They-They need the water, and I likes
to be the one that brings it to them.

70
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,080
Yeah. They like to give you a boot
in the patoot for all your trouble.

71
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,160
Bobby, you don't have what they call
"the social skills."

72
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,160
People don't understand you.
That's why you never have any
friends, except for your mama.

73
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,080
All I know is this, Jimmy:
Next Friday, August 29,
at the Baton Rouge Exposition Center,

74
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,640
I'm gonna open a can
of whoop-ass on Herculon,

75
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,280
and I'm gonna drive him back into
whatever galaxy it is he came from.

76
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,880
And that's a promise!

77
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,160
Strong words from a strong man,
Captain Insano.

78
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,040
Now let's take a call. It's our
old friend from Jackson's Bayou, Mr. B.

79
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,120
Hello, Jim.

80
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,600
l-ls it possible
to speak to Captain Insano?

81
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,680
- Shoot, Mr. B.
- Captain Insano,

82
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,120
I notice sometimes
when you are wrestling...

83
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,480
or-or openin' up a can of whoop-ass,
as you like to say...

84
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,840
- you seem to be sweating
quite profusely.
- Yeah?

85
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,680
I was wondering if,
perhaps, you might need...

86
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,880
the services
of an experienced waterboy.

87
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,800
That's pretty cute.

88
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,040
How old are you, kid?
Eleven, twelve?

89
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,920
I-I am 31 years old.

90
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,000
I guarantee, that guy's still a virgin.

91
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,000
Oh! Oh, my God!

92
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,640
This is where
they strip the ball from us.

93
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,680
And then we miss one tackle.
There, two tackles.

94
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,040
Joey drops the ball.

95
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,440
Whoops, he has time
to pick it up and dust it off
and run in for a touchdown...

96
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,880
before our guys even know
what's goin' on.

97
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,080
- Hello?
- My name is Bobby Boucher.

98
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,880
And I am inquiring as to whether
you have the need for
an experienced waterboy...

99
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,120
on your upcoming season.

100
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,560
Nice suit.

101
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,120
Thank you.
l-l-l-lt was my daddy's.

102
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,280
- Hold that thought.
- Yeah.

103
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,040
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
Come on. Come here.

104
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,760
Come here. Come on.
Come on, everybody.

105
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,520
- All right, this is it.
This is the play.
- Okay.

106
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,520
This is the play.
This is the play. Okay?

107
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,800
The quarterback. Two receivers
lined up to the left, one to the right.

108
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,160
There's a flanker lined up to the left
behind the quarterback.

109
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,160
- Oh, okay.
- He gives the ball...
No, he doesn't get the ball.

110
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,760
The receiver goes
all the way over there to the left.

111
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,360
Once the quarterback has the ball,
he fakes to the left.

112
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,360
No. He fakes to the right.
He doesn't fake.

113
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:11,960
He thinks about faking.
He pretends to fake.

114
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I don't know
where I am.

115
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,960
I can't breathe.

116
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,840
Or, this room is getting smaller.
I have to sit down.

117
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,360
Hang on here.
Take some water.

118
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,040
All right, there.

119
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,120
This is good. This is much better
than what I serve.

120
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,480
- That is the water that
you serve to your players?
- Uh-huh.

121
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,600
It is imperative that you allow me
to be your waterboy.

122
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:55,200
I can't hire you.
I can't hire anybody with the...

123
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,560
You do not have to... have to pay me.
I-I will do it for free.

124
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:02,200
Just promise me that you will
never distribute the contents
of that jug to any human person.

125
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:06,640
- That's a deal.
- It's a deal?

126
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,840
Thank you so-so much, Coach Klein.
l... I will not let you down.

127
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,320
- Good day.
- Good day.

128
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,120
I-I-I'll see you
at practice.

129
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,240
Quit hoggin' that.
Pass it over.

130
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,000
Okay.

131
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:01,160
Just have the defense
run sprints.

132
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,320
Yo! Water's better cold.

133
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:28,200
Yes, I agree, but to guarantee that
the H2O is-is purified,

134
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,880
i-it's good to use
the heating source, Sterno.

135
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,640
It's like my mama always says,
"Better safe than-than sorry."

136
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,240
My mama says that too.
Aren't all mamas the same?

137
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,720
- Yes.
- Derek. I kick
the field goals around here.

138
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,160
Will you listen up? I need
your cooperation. I need it now.

139
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,320
Is he gonna be-be
all right?

140
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:55,040
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He has
his good days and his bad days.

141
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,200
Used to be an assistant coach
at some big football school,

142
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,120
but he had a mental breakdown
or something.

143
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,680
Don't worry.
He'll snap out of it.

144
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,560
- Let me know when it
cools down, baby. All right.
- Yes.

145
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,920
Hey, did you all get a load
of the new waterboy?

146
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,360
Let's make him feel right at home.
Jerry, go right.

147
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,640
Casey, go left.
Way left.

148
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,680
- On one. Ready?
- Break!

149
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,640
Set! Red, 22!

150
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,440
Red, 22! Hut!

151
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:50,840
l-I-I-I think you zigged
when you should've zagged on that play.

152
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,680
- Sorry.
- Hey, Waterboy, check this out.

153
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,920
Hey, Waterboy!
Check this out.

154
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,920
Yes.

155
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,920
Well, my, my, my.

156
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,760
Was my little aquatic engineer about
to bash one of my football players?

157
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,360
Well, he spit
in the c-c-cooler.

158
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,840
He happens to be
a finely tuned athletic machine.

159
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,520
And I ain't gonna have him hit
in the head by some idiot waterboy.

160
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,040
Do you understand me?

161
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,200
- Are you all right?
- What? I wasn't gonna
do nothin', Coach.

162
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,160
Well, you better do something.
You gotta defend yourself here, Bobby.

163
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,400
But they're-they're-they're
finely tuned athletic machines.

164
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,320
I am not telling you
to go on a shooting rampage.

165
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,600
But you have to stand up
for yourself, or they're
gonna ride you all season long.

166
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,640
Believe me,
I've seen it myself.

167
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,720
Hey, moron!

168
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,800
Hey! Moron! Duh!

169
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,280
L-Look at me. I'm the w-w-waterboy.

170
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,680
Duh! I got
a wooden spoon. Duh!

171
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,760
Smell like you could use
a shower, stinky.

172
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,480
You're fired!

173
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,840
Stop makin' fun of me.

174
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,920
Red, ready! Hut!

175
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,640
- Wow!
- Damn!

176
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,920
I'm sorry.

177
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,800
Who that?
Who there?

178
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,040
So that's what openin' up
a can of whoop-ass feels like.

179
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,880
Son, you just opened
a whole case of whoop-ass.

180
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,480
I would be honored if you
play football for this team.

181
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,040
- Me? Play football?
- Yes.

182
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,600
Thanks, but no thanks. My mama
won't let me play no football.

183
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,320
We're gonna go home.
You and I, we're gonna talk to Mama.

184
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,160
M-Mama said... M-Mama said...
My mama said... Mama said...

185
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,800
- My mama said... My mama say that...
- She's gonna say yes.

186
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,960
Mmm, that snake
looks delicious.

187
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,880
What part do you think
I'm about to eat?

188
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:51,960
Uh, basically
a snake don't have parts.

189
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,000
But, uh, if I had to
call it anything,

190
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,160
I would say
it's his knee.

191
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,760
Great. His knee.

192
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,760
And what are we having
for dessert?

193
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,040
Squirrel.

194
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,520
Excellent.

195
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,720
Let's talk about Bobby
playing football.

196
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,720
I don't like it, Mr. Coach Klein.
I don't like it one bit.

197
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,440
You see, my boy is too delicate
to be playin' "fool's ball"...

198
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,520
or whatever you call it...
with them gargantuans.

199
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,800
I don't think you understand,
Mrs. Boucher.

200
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,200
No, you don't understand me,
Mr. Coach Klein.

201
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:34,080
My boy is all I got left. Ow!

202
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,200
Mama, here.

203
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,120
It's the brain pain, Coach.

204
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,240
You see, my husband Robert,

205
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,920
one day back in 1966,
pick up sticks,

206
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,520
and me four months pregnant
with this precious angel.

207
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,960
He decides he wants to go
and help the foreign peoples.

208
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,800
He's gonna go
and join the peace corps.

209
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,000
And he promise me
that everything's gonna be okay.

210
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,880
Just like you
promisin' me now.

211
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,520
But everything wasn't okay. No.

212
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,000
He got lost in the middle
of the Sahara Desert.

213
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:07,360
And he died.
He died!

214
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:12,840
- Couldn't get no water, Coach.
He died of the dehydration.
- And we were left all alone.

215
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:17,000
I would've gotten my daddy some water,
but I was just a little baby
inside Mama's stomach.

216
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:20,000
And now you wanna take away
the only part of my Robert I have left.

217
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:24,160
But don't you want the only part you've
got left to get a college education?

218
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,560
- Nah.
- Me, a college student?

219
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,480
Yes. Bobby, think about it.

220
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,600
A whole new world
will open to you.

221
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,720
Boy, Mama, that-that-that sounds nice.
Me-Me, a college man.

222
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,800
Coach, my Bobby's
a sweet boy,

223
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,440
but he ain't exactly what you'd call
"college material,"

224
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,280
so don't you go fillin' his simple head
with all those crazy dreams...

225
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,160
of school and college
and things of that sort.

226
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,600
But Mama, I-I'm tired
of everybody callin' me a dummy.

227
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,920
I'm-I'm tired
of not havin' any friends.

228
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,000
And my ass is tired sittin' here
jawin' all night. I'm goin' to bed.

229
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,000
Nice to meet you, Mr. Coach.
Good luck with your fool's ball.

230
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,800
Bobby, after you let Mr. Coach out,
you come into my bedroom.

231
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,200
Mama'll brush your hair.

232
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,800
You know, when I was your age,

233
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:14,080
my mother told me not to get a tattoo...
of Roy Orbison.

234
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:24,000
But what Mama don't know
won't hurt her.

235
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,440
I trust you'll make
the right decision.

236
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,440
Damn, I don't want that ass
on the team.

237
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,360
Everybody's gonna
laugh at us.

238
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,360
Everybody's already
laughin' at us.

239
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,120
We ain't won a game
since 1994.

240
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,520
- Hey! What's up, baby?
- Hey.

241
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,560
- Where's your helmet?
- Derek Wallace, they-they
don't got no more helmets.

242
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,480
Here. You can share mine.

243
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,880
Try it on, man.
See if it fits.

244
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,560
- All right.
- Thanks, friend.

245
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,840
What a dink.

246
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,120
Come on!
Huddle up!

247
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,240
All right,
we have an announcement to make.

248
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:24,200
Our former waterboy, Bobby Boucher,
is gonna play some linebacker for us.

249
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:29,760
Ooh, I'm a f-f-football player.

250
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,400
- Coach, I'd like to tackle him
right now, please.
- Not yet.

251
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,800
All right, now I wanna work with the
offense. I wanna work with the defense.

252
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,760
- Special teams, go with
Farmer Fran, do some laps.
- Shit.

253
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,720
Line up on the ball.

254
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,080
- Let's go.
- All right? Third and ten.

255
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,160
Third and ten?

256
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,760
Yeah, you know, that's
the offense's last opportunity...

257
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,680
to gain ten yards
before they have to punt.

258
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,600
Gee, he's gonna run
the option.

259
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,520
Option?

260
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,280
He ain't never gonna be able
to figure this out, Coach.

261
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,160
Yes, he is.

262
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,760
Now, Bobby, you've waterboyed
for 18 years.

263
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,720
Didn't you occasionally
watch the game?

264
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,560
Oh, I had a lot
to k-keep me busy.

265
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:23,160
- Checking the pH levels,
refillin' the cups.
- All right.

266
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,200
Well, then let's just
keep it simple.

267
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,480
Casey. I want you
to tackle Casey...

268
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,960
like you did Gee yesterday.

269
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,880
- Right now?
- Right now! Go!

270
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,760
- Does he know about this?
- Doesn't matter. You're a warrior.

271
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,680
Go.

272
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,120
Boy, what you doin'?

273
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,440
All right. Bobby, Bobby.

274
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,800
Don't be afraid to use
all of your strength, you know?

275
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,160
He's resilient.
He's a resilient guy.

276
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,080
Okay? Come on.

277
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,400
Hey, Casey,
I think he wanna make out with you.

278
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,320
Okay, that's enough. Thank you.

279
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:06,440
Is there any sport that you
do watch? You know, a physical sport?

280
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,680
- Boxing? Hockey?
- Wrestling.

281
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,880
Wrestling! Wrestling is good.

282
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,800
Who's your favorite wrestler?

283
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,040
Well, even though he was slightly
discourteous to me recently,

284
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,120
I'm gonna have to say
Captain Insano.

285
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,720
Okay, okay,
I want you to do to Casey...

286
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,920
what Captain Insano does
to the bad guy.

287
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,840
Go.

288
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,200
Ow! Ow!

289
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,280
- He poked me in the eye.
- Captain Insano shows no mercy.

290
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:44,160
Bobby, where was the intensity
that I saw yesterday?

291
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,880
That was no intensity. You said it
was all right to fight back,

292
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,800
and I-I just started thinkin'
about all the people who-who'd
been mean to me over the years.

293
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,520
That's it.
That's it.

294
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,760
I want you to think about
all those mean people.

295
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:01,400
- They're gonna be your tackling fuel.
- Tacklin' fuel.

296
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,240
- We're gonna use them to play football.
- Tacklin' fuel.

297
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:09,280
I want you to pretend
that Casey...

298
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,640
- is insulting you.
- Pretend?

299
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:15,640
I want you to visualize all those
people that have been mean to you.

300
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,400
And then I want you to attack. I want
you to visualize and then attack.

301
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,000
- Can you handle that?
- I'll try.

302
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,920
He's gonna try.

303
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,040
What's the matter with you, boy?
You too s-s-stupid...

304
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,080
to do what your coach
tells ya?

305
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,280
No!

306
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,160
No what?

307
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,400
I didn't mean to hurt you.
Coach told me to pretend.

308
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,480
Bobby. Bobby! Can you do this for
me every single game? Can you do this?

309
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,760
Coach, not only
will I do it for you.

310
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:02,480
l-l-l...
Yes, yes, I'll do it for ya.

311
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:10,320
So, uh, why you pick this class anyway?
It's pretty hard.

312
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,560
Oh, beautiful view.

313
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,160
Correct.

314
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,320
All right, all right!

315
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,240
Y'all shut up now!

316
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:25,440
Now, last week,
we talked about...

317
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,600
the physiology
of the animal brain...

318
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,520
as it pertains
to aggression.

319
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:34,040
Now is there anyone here
that can tell me why...

320
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,080
most alligators
are abnormally aggressive?

321
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:40,240
- I know the answer to this question.
- Raise your hand.

322
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:44,120
Anybody? Anyone?
Yes, sir. You, sir.

323
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,000
Mama says that alligators
are ornery...

324
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,760
'cause they got all them teeth
but no toothbrush.

325
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,920
Yo mama said,

326
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,560
alligators are ornery
'cause they got all them teeth...

327
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,600
and no toothbrush.

328
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,560
Wow!

329
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,480
Anybody else?
Yes, sir. You, sir.

330
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,000
Alligators are aggressive because
of an enlarged medulla oblongata.

331
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,960
It's the sector of the brain
which controls aggressive behavior.

332
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:16,960
- That is correct!
The medulla oblongata.
- But Mama said...

333
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,800
The medulla oblongata...

334
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:25,680
is where anger, jealousy
and aggression come from.

335
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:30,480
Now, is there anybody here can tell
me where happiness comes from?

336
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,560
- No, man.
- Anyone?

337
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:39,760
All right, let's hear what
Mama has to say on the subject.

338
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:45,280
Mama say that happiness is
from magic rays of sunshine that
come down when you feelin' blue.

339
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:51,440
Well, folks,
Mama's wrong again.

340
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,480
No, Colonel Sanders,
you're wrong.

341
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,160
- Ooh!
- Mama's right.

342
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,880
You're all wrong.
Mama's right. Mama's right!

343
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,200
Somethin' wrong
with his medulla oblongata.

344
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,240
It's okay to fight back.
Coach Klein said I could.

345
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,440
Mr. Coach Klein said I could.
It's fine, fellas.

346
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,880
Well, Mud Dog
fans, it's time to kick off...

347
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,840
another year
of Mud Dog football.

348
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:25,720
With the weight of a 40-game
losing streak on their back,

349
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:29,080
everyone seems to be diggin' in
for the long haul.

350
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,320
What you doin', Bobby?

351
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,880
Oh, Lord, that-that-that's some
heavy-duty armpit saturation.

352
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,800
That's an early warning sign of
the dehydration. You gots to have H2O.

353
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,560
- Please, for me.
- Look, you need to stop
worryin' about water, baby,

354
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,800
and start worryin'
about the game today, okay?

355
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,520
Here. Now, just do whatever you did
to Colonel Sanders,

356
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,440
and you'll be fine.

357
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,600
I-I will, thank you. I-I-I just...
I feel bad about lyin' to my mama.

358
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,640
I wonder what
she's doin' right now.

359
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,120
And he's down
with a three-yard kickoff return.

360
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,480
- The Mud Dogs offense takes the field.
- Okay, come on, here we go.

361
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:25,840
Come on, everybody.
You can do it. Gain some yards.
Put some points on the board.

362
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,000
Hey, Walter,
I'll bet you 50 bucks...

363
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,560
Gee Grenouille throws a touchdown pass
on the first play.

364
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,480
Check it out.

365
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,640
Set, fool, 22, hut!

366
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,800
You owe me 50 bucks.

367
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:49,040
- You said it was gonna be
a touchdown pass, you crazy asshole.
- Go, go, go, go!

368
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,480
Hold 'em, hold 'em, hold 'em.
Okay, you can do it. Come on.

369
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,880
Bobby, Bobby, this is
just like we practiced, okay?

370
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,800
Okay, go, go, go.
Come on.

371
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:03,640
Watch where you're going, needle dick.

372
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,240
Set! 390!

373
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:18,400
Time for retard to find out what
college football's all about.

374
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,840
390! Check, check.

375
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:26,600
Red, 18! Red, 18!

376
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:30,040
Needle dick! Needle dick!
Needle dick!

377
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,640
Yeah!

378
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,000
Your name is needle dick.

379
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,480
I knew that this was a good idea.

380
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,480
Yes!

381
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,720
- Time-out from the game.
- What's he calling time-out for?

382
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:04,280
- Man, what are you doin'?
- Here, this is for you.

383
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,200
Enjoy.

384
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:09,720
Hey, Waterboy, you're fired!
- Stop it!

385
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,720
Yes! Bobby!

386
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:26,200
- Ooh-la-la. Yeah, man! Yeah!
- Yeah, yeah!

387
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:29,080
- Slap hands!
- Whatever.

388
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,400
Waterboy's killin' 'em.

389
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,800
He's the best tackler
I've seen since Joe Montana.

390
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,800
Joe Montana was a quarterback,
you idiot.

391
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,880
I said, "Joe Mantegna."

392
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:48,600
We're tied at seven with
30 seconds to go in the fourth quarter.

393
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:52,160
Eagle cover two.
Eagle cover two. Ready?

394
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,560
Best of luck to you
on-on-on the upcoming play.

395
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:01,440
- I'll be playin' with your mama tonight.
- Sixty-two.

396
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,840
- Move, 22, hut!
- Bernard drops back.

397
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:08,080
Looks like a screen pass.

398
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:11,640
Sixty-two! Sixty-two!
There you are!

399
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,560
Thank you.

400
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:16,440
Number 62 is headed for the end zone.

401
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:19,920
He's at the 40, the 30.
He's almost...

402
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,920
Man! Touchdown!
Reds lead.

403
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,520
Dropkick. Looks like Boucher
knocked him out cold.

404
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,920
I love my mama very much.
Now you know that.

405
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,000
The waterboy handed them the game.
What an idiot.

406
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,160
Waterboy, you stink!

407
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,720
Nice job, shithead.
You just lost us the game.

408
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:50,680
I'm sorry. Would you please
still be my friend?

409
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,400
No! Get away from me.

410
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,800
Okay.

411
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,440
Excuse me?
May I help you?

412
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,600
Hey, stud.

413
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:09,400
Vicki Vallencourt, this is...
this is quite a pleasant surprise.

414
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:13,440
Yeah, well, I just got out of jail,
and I heard you were playin' football.

415
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,360
Yes, well, I-I-I've...

416
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,920
Yes.

417
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,600
So, let's say we go and get
somethin' to eat, catch up on things.

418
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,560
Oh, uh...

419
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,640
Mama's not a-a-a big fan
of restaurants...

420
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,760
or of-of me going to one.

421
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,440
But if-if you'd like,
sometimes,

422
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:45,600
Mama, she, uh... she like to...
on a Sunday afternoon...

423
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:50,160
There-There's a-a-a grill
with the charcoal b-biscuits.

424
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,560
- You want me to come to a barbecue?
- Yes, that's it.

425
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,240
Sounds great.

426
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,440
And by the way, I hope you like
what I did to y'all lawn mower.

427
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,560
You know that old hag that does
astrology on Good Morning America,

428
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,480
she really ought
to pack it in.

429
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:18,520
Listen what she said
for Sagittarius. She goes:

430
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,160
"You're gonna be faced with
a difficult decision today."

431
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,520
But the thing is-is-is, we're all faced
with difficult decisions every day.

432
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,640
- That's like sayin'
you're gonna eat today.
- Yeah, m-maybe...

433
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,880
by leaving her predictions
vague and generalized,

434
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,720
there's less of a chance of someone
findin' out she's a phony.

435
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,200
Whatever, college boy.

436
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:38,560
- Don't say college boy. Here comes Mama.
- Oh, okay.

437
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,920
That looks nice, Mama.

438
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,840
- Mmm, here you go, Vicki Vallencourt.
- Thank you.

439
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,880
Mama, Vicki's
an astrologist.

440
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,120
I don't believe in that sort
of thing, personally.

441
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,360
Astronomy is one
of the many tools of the devil.

442
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,800
You sure played great
yesterday, Bobby.

443
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:06,560
- What did my boy play great?
- Uh, um...

444
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,920
Waterboy. Yeah, waterboy.
He played... He played waterboy great.

445
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,280
Everybody who was thirsty
got a drink right away...

446
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,880
yesterday at the...
at the football game.

447
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:20,400
Fool's ball! Bunch of overgrown
monsters manhandling each other.

448
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,920
Remember when that man wanted you
to play fool's ball, Bobby?

449
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,720
Yeah, l... He...
Roy Orbison...

450
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,480
Coach Klein.
I-I-I remember.

451
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,480
So, Bobby, did they ever catch
that gorilla...

452
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,960
what escaped from the zoo
and punched you in the eye?

453
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:38,280
No, Mama, he...
The-The search continues.

454
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:45,720
What would you think if Bobby
did play football, Mrs. Boucher?

455
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,440
Well, I wouldn't
think much of it at all.

456
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,080
And to tell you the truth,
I don't think much of you...

457
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:54,240
and all your snotty questions,
Miss Vallencourt.

458
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,400
I'm quite disturbed to see
that you're so interested in my boy.

459
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:01,480
I'm very, very interested
in your boy, Mrs. Boucher.

460
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,120
- Really?
- Mm.

461
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,520
Well, did he tell you
about how much his feet smell?

462
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,160
- Mama.
- He has to wear two pair of socks.

463
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,280
Well, men are supposed
to have stinky feet.

464
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,320
Well, are men
supposed to wear pajamas...

465
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,960
featuring a cartoon character
by the name of Deputy Dog?

466
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,760
- Mama, please.
- Well, you know what?

467
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,160
I happen to find
Deputy Dog to be...

468
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:25,280
very, very sexy.

469
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,960
Did he tell you about
a little bedtime problem?

470
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:31,880
- Mama, I'm beggin' you, don't.
- That's his sheet back there.

471
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:36,360
If you'll excuse me, ladies,
I'm gonna go hang myself.

472
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:39,200
- Now you see what you done?
- What I did?

473
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,400
Now you listen here, cupcake. The
"onliest" woman in my boy's life is me.

474
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,480
Nobody's gonna take him away, especially
not some godless Jezebel like you.

475
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,680
Oh, yeah, well your Bobby
is a grown man.

476
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:52,280
And guess what? He can hang out
with whoever he wants!

477
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,680
Oh, yes, he can.
Whoever he wants. 'Cept you!

478
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:58,200
Bobby, that-that woman
is the devil.

479
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,360
- I want you to stay away
from her, you hear me?
- Yes, Mama.

480
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:03,680
Now you come on inside before that
little ol' witch casts a spell on us!

481
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,920
I'm sorry,
Vicki Vallencourt.

482
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,360
Whatever.

483
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:29,320
When we report on the S.C.L.S.U.
Mud Dogs here on Sportscenter,
it's usually to add...

484
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,920
another number to their amazing
losing streak, which now stands at 41.

485
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,320
But now, Bobby Boucher
has given us another reason.

486
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,320
In the Mud Dog's latest loss
this past Saturday,

487
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:41,240
the amazing 31-year-old freshman
set a new N.C.A.A. record...

488
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,760
by sacking the quarterback
16 times,

489
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,040
shattering the old record
of seven.

490
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:49,240
And, oh, by the way, Bobby Boucher
is also the team's waterboy,

491
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,480
which, of course,
begs the question:

492
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,600
What exactly are they putting
in the water...

493
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:56,480
down in Jackson's Bayou,
Louisiana?

494
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:09,960
We're deadlocked
at three with less than a minute to go.

495
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,440
We are one family with one dream.

496
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,440
There are 40 of you
on this team, not just one.

497
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:18,080
Bobby can't do this by himself. Now get
out there and make something happen!

498
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,440
All right, sacrifice
your bodies. Go, go, go!

499
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:24,680
Thank you. Bobby, you're gonna
have to do this by yourself...

500
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,000
because there is nobody
on this team that's any good.

501
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,720
Now look, I can't stand
losing anymore.

502
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,640
We've got to win one game. Can you
go out there and make something happen?

503
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,400
- Visualize and attack.
- Yeah.

504
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,960
- Visualize and attack. Please!
- Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes.

505
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,680
Please!

506
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,920
Central Kentucky's down
to their third straight quarterback.

507
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,400
Good news, folks.
First-string quarterback, Tommy Gardner,

508
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,400
does not have a broken neck.

509
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,960
Blue, 52!
Blue, 52! Hut!

510
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,960
I forbid you to talk to
that enchantress. She's the devil!

511
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,760
She's not the devil. She's the
most beautiful woman in the world.

512
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:00,400
- I never said she was the devil.
- She's the most beautiful woman
in the world.

513
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,400
Oh, please, don't hurt me!

514
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:07,240
Follow the...
Come on!

515
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,200
You crazy man!
Okay, okay, okay!

516
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:12,760
It's a safety!
They win, they win, they win!

517
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,920
With the help of Boucher,
the losing streak is over!

518
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:19,120
I'm so sorry, Mama.
Please, forgive me.

519
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:22,360
I love you so much, Mama.
I love you.

520
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,760
- I love you too.
- We won!

521
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:28,440
We won, baby! It's gonna be a big
party tonight, and you're going!

522
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,720
- Me? Party?
- Yeah, baby!

523
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,920
Party! Party!

524
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,040
Hey! Nice suit.

525
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,400
Thank you.
It was my daddy's.

526
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:56,720
Mama don't know I'm here,
but I took these outta the icebox:
Louisiana frog cakes.

527
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,800
Thanks.

528
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:02,440
- Come on in.
- Hey, Bobby Boucher!

529
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,080
Look who's here:
Sergeant Stutter.

530
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:08,760
- Want a beer?
- I'll take a Scotch and water.
Hold the Scotch.

531
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:12,120
- You just make a joke, Bobby?
- Yes, I did.

532
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:15,120
Good one.

533
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:19,280
Now that you finally won a game, right,
you feel looser, the pressure is off,

534
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,920
and that will lead
to a lot more victories.

535
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,280
- Yeah, that and a waterboy
getting 20 sacks a game.
- That too.

536
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,200
Professor!

537
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:33,000
We still havin' that test on amphibians
and reptiles next Friday?

538
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:37,800
Yes, sir. That is,
if it's all right with you.

539
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:42,520
- Of course, it is.
- My best regards to your dear mama.

540
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,320
Let's talk to the waterboy.

541
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,480
You played amazing
at the game today, Bobby.

542
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:51,400
And you are so cute.
Is there a girl you're seein'?

543
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:56,280
Seein'? Uh, uh, I see
a lot of girls.

544
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,520
I see a lot of guys too.

545
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,000
I think that's sexy.

546
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,480
You ever been with a guy and a girl
at the same time?

547
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,400
Oh, yeah, plenty of times.

548
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:08,880
The other night, I was with my mama
and Coach Klein at the same time.

549
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,320
You are a bad boy.
I wish you were my boyfriend.

550
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:18,720
Oh, thank you, but, see, there's
this girl, Vicki Vallencourt.

551
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,840
She may be the devil.
Mama said that.

552
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:23,880
Consequently, I am prohibited
from contact with her.

553
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:28,120
But I hope to get past that
one day 'cause she's nice to talk to.

554
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,120
Oh, oh.

555
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,120
Yo, we have a very special
guest here today.

556
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:26,800
Let's have a warm L.T. welcome
for Bobby Boucher. Come on, Bobby.

557
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:29,080
Thank you, Mr. Lawrence Taylor.

558
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:32,720
Tell me, what is your secret?
How do you find yourself
in the right position all the time?

559
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,680
That-That-That's
a good question.

560
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:38,520
What-What happens is, the-the-the
center has-has the ball first.

561
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,560
And-And-And the quarterback
will say, "Hike."

562
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,440
That's when the c-center puts the ball
in-into the hands of the quarterback.

563
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,480
So what I do is,
I-I start tacklin' the quarterback,

564
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,880
unless he give the ball
to-to s-somebody else,

565
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,000
in which case,
I-I try to tackle that person.

566
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:58,480
Hmm? Children, which brings me
to my next point:

567
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,440
Don't smoke crack.

568
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:14,040
Vicki Vallencourt.
What you doin' here?

569
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,720
Oh, nothin'.
I was just thinkin'...

570
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:20,200
about stealin' L.T.'s Porsche
over there.

571
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:24,440
But I suppose I ought to
be movin' on before I get you
in trouble with your mama.

572
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:29,200
Well, Mr. Coach Klein said that
what Mama don't know won't hurt her.

573
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:33,880
So maybe we could
ride home together.

574
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:37,640
- Really?
- If you'd like to.

575
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:40,240
Okay.

576
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:43,400
Who got the hooch?

577
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,920
You can sit down,
if you'd like.

578
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,160
Vicki Vallencourt,
I figured...

579
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:28,920
'cause you're interested in astrology
and mystical stuff like that,

580
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,320
you might appreciate this.

581
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:36,280
That's water
from a glacier in Alaska.

582
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:40,720
It-lt was blessed
by a-an Eskimo medicine man.

583
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:46,320
- It's cold!
- Yes, it's always cold.
That's why it's so special.

584
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,360
That-That was...
That-That-That-That happened...

585
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:08,560
That-That happened to be
my-my first time with-with lips...

586
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:12,400
and-and-and-and-and
and-and-and-and-and the-the tongue.

587
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:16,080
That was your tongue.
l... I believe it was...

588
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,200
I never did that before.

589
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,120
Well, if that was
your first kiss,

590
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:24,080
then I bet it's the first time
you've seen a pair of these.

591
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:29,920
Yes, yes, that is
a-another first for me,

592
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,040
and I-I appreciate what-what-what
you're showin' me right now.

593
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:39,920
Vicki-Vicki Vallencourt,
I-I think Mama's up.

594
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:45,320
Devil, devil, devil.

595
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,040
You better get goin'.

596
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:53,880
My God, Bobby, I mean, sometimes,
I just don't know why I bother with you.

597
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:56,240
You ain't even a man.

598
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:03,040
It looks like
the Cinderella S.C.L.S.U. Mud Dogs,

599
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:05,280
led by linebacker
Bobby Boucher,

600
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:08,920
are gonna fall one victory short
of that Bourbon Bowl bid.

601
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,120
Iowa could win the game
by nailing this 20-yard field goal.

602
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,840
Yeah, but the Mud Dogs have played
a sensational football game.

603
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,640
Let's take a look at the way Boucher
entered the Hawkeyes' last drive.

604
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,320
Let's take a look at the way Boucher
entered the Hawkeyes' last drive.

605
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,720
Here we see Boucher
instantly penetratin' the pocket.

606
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,240
There's a lot of pain
and shame in those eyes.

607
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:30,000
Friends, it's all over.

608
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:33,480
- My leg!
- Wow, that is a disturbing image.

609
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,880
Difficult to watch, Chris.

610
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,640
Whoo! My God!

611
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:42,880
Gonna kick some names
and take some ass!

612
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,320
Bobby!

613
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:48,560
Water sucks.
Gatorade is better.

614
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,400
- What?
- Use it on the field.

615
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,080
Waterboy, Waterboy, Waterboy!

616
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:05,920
Gatorade not only quenches your thirst
better, it tastes better too, idiot.

617
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,920
You're-You're-You're drinkin'
the wrong water.

618
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,800
- Gatorade.
- H2O.

619
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:17,120
- Gatorade!
- H2O!

620
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,840
Stop saying that. You don't
mean that. You're bad people.

621
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,280
And my friend, Chris,

622
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:48,240
the Mud Dogs are goin'
to the Bourbon Bowl.

623
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:53,480
With yesterday's come-from-behind
victory, the S.C.L.S.U. Mud Dogs...

624
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:56,320
earned a New Year's Day date with Red
Beaulieu and the Louisiana Cougars...

625
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,280
in the first annual
Bourbon Bowl.

626
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:01,560
But not only has the waterboy
changed S.C.L.S.U.'s fortunes,

627
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:04,040
he's got other teams looking
around the sidelines for talent.

628
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:07,400
In fact, yesterday, Michigan,
devastated by injury,

629
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,960
experimented with their towel boy
at wide receiver.

630
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,640
But the towel boy ran into
a laundry list of problems.

631
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:38,600
You know, when I see
so many of you here tonight,

632
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:43,680
it reminds me just about how special
this season really was.

633
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,840
Not just for the team.

634
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,240
Not just for the students.

635
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:51,120
But for each and every
one of you...

636
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:54,800
in our small corner
of Louisiana!

637
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,600
You can do it!

638
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:02,640
Oh, yes, we can,
and, yes, we will.

639
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,520
Because we've got...

640
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:08,840
a young man who has been
so vital to our success.

641
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,800
A wonderful student-athlete.

642
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,280
And a wonderful friend.

643
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:19,200
Ladies and gentlemen,
Bobby Boucher!

644
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:29,000
- Waterboy, number one!
- You can do it!

645
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:37,160
Thank you so much...

646
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,160
for bein' my friends.

647
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:43,240
You can do it!

648
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:46,600
I'd also like to take
this opportunity...

649
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,560
to tell you that my mama
don't know how I play football,

650
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:54,200
so if-if you could not tell
my mama I-I play football,
that would be for the best.

651
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:16,600
We must be a little lost. We're tryin'
to get to the Bourbon Bowl.

652
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:19,720
Looks like we ended up
in Retardville, U.S.A.

653
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:26,760
Hey, Waterboy, you fixin'
to tackle all of us?

654
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:32,200
- Kick his water-lovin' ass, Greg.
- I asked you a question, dumb ass.

655
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:37,600
You even exhale,
and I will saw your head off.

656
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:40,760
You can do it!
Cut his fucking head off!

657
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:45,960
Hold it, hold it. Just a minute.
Now what is the problem here, honey?

658
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,360
I mean, whatever it is,
we don't want this to get physical.

659
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,280
Right, Klein?

660
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:53,920
Yeah, well, your team actin'
like a bunch of shitheads.

661
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:59,120
This is not how ambassadors
for the University of Louisiana
are supposed to act.

662
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:03,720
So now you just get back on the bus.

663
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:07,960
However,
assault with a deadly weapon,

664
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:10,360
very, very serious offense.

665
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:14,600
Officer, get her
little country ass outta here.

666
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,360
Thank you, Vicki.

667
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:20,080
Let's go.

668
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:24,840
Ah! It's the waterboy!

669
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,760
I got something for you.

670
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:31,400
This is his transcript from
South Lafayette High School...

671
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,600
in Cherokee Plains,
Louisiana.

672
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,960
Now the problem with that...

673
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:40,880
is there ain't no South Lafayette High
School in Cherokee Plains, Louisiana.

674
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:45,040
So obviously, this is a fake!

675
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:49,000
However, this is not a fake.

676
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:51,640
This is from the N.C.A.A.

677
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:54,200
They don't think you ought
to play football no more.

678
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:58,240
So allow me to say this to you
one more time:

679
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,160
You're fired.

680
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:03,160
Oh, no!
We suck again!

681
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:06,600
Ever see a championship ring?

682
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:10,040
- Don't be messin' with the champ.
Come on, Laski.
- You didn't go to high school?

683
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:13,280
I was home schooled.
I-I didn't know I needed...

684
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:17,600
- Forged a fake transcript.
- No, no, I-I-I didn't.

685
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:20,280
The waterboy's a cheater.
Cut his head off.

686
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:24,040
Listen, everybody!
This don't change nothin'!

687
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:27,160
We played as a team,
we won as a team.

688
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:29,320
And just because
the waterboy's a cheater,

689
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:32,080
don't change the fact
that the real Mud Dogs...

690
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,560
are gonna kick
some Cougar ass.

691
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,840
Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs!

692
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:41,400
Mud Dogs!
Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs!

693
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:45,320
Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs!
Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs!

694
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:49,080
Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs!
Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs!

695
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:51,040
That's the way!

696
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:59,800
Sorry, Bobby.

697
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:09,800
Believe me,
I-I understand.

698
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,280
Yeah, and you're
deeply appreciated, Mr. Dodd.

699
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:15,720
Thank you so much.
Bye-bye.

700
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:18,000
Good news, Bobby.

701
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:21,360
- The N.C.A.A. is gonna allow you
to play in the Bourbon Bowl.
- Yes.

702
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,600
You just have to pass the high school
equivalency test.

703
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,880
It's not the test, Coach.

704
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,120
Everybody hates me.

705
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:33,640
That's not true.

706
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:36,800
One man said he wanted
to decapitate me.

707
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:40,560
Nobody else thought that
to be too bad of an idea.

708
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,520
Somebody made me
look like a-a-a cheater.

709
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:49,040
I did it. I did it. I did it!
I did it! I did it!

710
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:52,840
- It was me.
- Why?

711
00:50:56,240 --> 00:51:01,040
Because I wanted you to play.
Because you were my way out, Bobby.

712
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:04,160
'Cause it was the only way
to get you in.

713
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,720
I am so sorry.

714
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,520
Why didn't you s-stick up for me
down by the river?

715
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:16,200
The truth is, I fled.

716
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,840
I came into my office,
I went under my desk, I cried.

717
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:22,240
I cried. I cried
like a ten-year-old girl!

718
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:31,080
Red and I have a history.

719
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:33,280
Twenty years ago,
we were assistants to Coach Cavanaugh...

720
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:36,640
at the University
of Louisiana.

721
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:40,120
Red ran the practices,
and I used to come up with the plays.

722
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:43,520
Oh, boy, was I good.

723
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:49,760
I would write these foolproof plays
in my little green notebook that I had.

724
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:52,840
The opposition
didn't even know what hit 'em.

725
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,760
And when Coach Cavanaugh
was going to retire,

726
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:58,160
me and Red, we just knew that one of us
was gonna be his successor.

727
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:03,680
- Hey, Red.
- How ya doin'?

728
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,680
Come by to wish me luck?

729
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:13,120
Well, not exactly, no, no.
Actually, I come by to get you
to do ol' Red a little favor.

730
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,280
Sure. What's up?

731
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:19,200
Well, you know that green
notebook you use to write
all them football plays in?

732
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:23,360
Well, I need to show Cavanaugh that
I can come up with some good play ideas.

733
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,240
But you didn't come up
with them.

734
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:29,520
They're my plays.
I need them.

735
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:34,920
Klein, I'm gonna have
this book one way or another,

736
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,800
so you might as well let the damn
thing go, 'cause if you don't,

737
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:40,560
it's gonna get awfully,
awfully physical around here.

738
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:44,040
And I don't think
you want that, do you? Huh?

739
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:51,920
Of course, Red got the job.
Next day, fired me.

740
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,120
Once he had my notebook,
he didn't need me anymore.

741
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:58,200
I didn't take it very well.

742
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:01,800
No, Grandma,
I didn't get it.

743
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:04,120
I can't believe it myself.

744
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:08,800
I know.
I'm so numb.

745
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:11,280
I just hate him,
I hate him, I hate him.

746
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:15,520
That is a terrible story, Coach.

747
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:18,800
- But why-why don't you just
come up with some new plays?
- I tried.

748
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:20,720
- I can't.
- Yes.

749
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:25,840
I guess I have a mental block,
you know, ever since Red took
my playbook and my manhood.

750
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:29,320
I knew what he was gonna do!

751
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:32,240
And I just didn't fight back.

752
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:35,920
Well, you're gonna show him
that you're a man on Saturday.

753
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:39,600
And I'm gonna show everybody
that I'm not a dummy.

754
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:42,760
I'm gonna go study.

755
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:51,600
Mama, maybe you could stop brushin'
my hair so I can read.

756
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:53,760
Read?

757
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:56,760
You don't have to read.

758
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:02,360
- What you readin' for?
- 'Cause I enjoys it, Mama.

759
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:05,840
Don't look like to me you enjoys it,
sittin' there all grouchy.

760
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:10,280
Mama, I gotta read this book
and six other books tonight,
or else I can't play foot...

761
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,040
ball.

762
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:20,120
Fool's ball? You playin'
the fool's ball behind my back?

763
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:22,680
The only reason I'm doin' this
so, so I can go to school.

764
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:27,120
School? You goin' to school?

765
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,560
Sorry, Mama. I wanted to tell you.

766
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:33,880
You off gallivantin' with your fancy
fool's ball friends at school,

767
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:38,520
while I'm sittin' here all day
with nobody to keep me company,
except Steve?

768
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,920
The chickens are comin' home
to roost, Bobby Boucher.

769
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:46,480
You reap the fruit
of your selfish ways.

770
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:48,680
You're gonna lose all your
fancy fool's ball games...

771
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:51,800
and you're gonna fail your big exam,
because school is...

772
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:53,720
The devil?

773
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:56,880
Everything is the devil
to you, Mama!

774
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:00,720
Well, I like school,
and I like football!

775
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:04,200
And I'm gonna keep doin' them both
because they make me feel good!

776
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:08,160
And by the way, Mama,
alligators are ornery...

777
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:10,720
because of their
medulla oblongata!

778
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:19,280
And I like Vicki,
and she likes me back!

779
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:21,800
And she showed me her boobies,
and I liked them too!

780
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:39,360
The Louisiana High School
Equivalency Examination...

781
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:42,640
consists of 300
multiple choice questions.

782
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:46,200
You have three hours.
Good luck to you, sir.

783
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:19,080
Ben Franklin.

784
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,760
Mama, when did Ben Franklin
invent electricity?

785
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:27,320
That's nonsense!
I invented electricity.

786
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:29,960
Ben Franklin is the devil!

787
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:42,880
I can't believe
you got a 97!

788
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:45,120
I-I-I can't believe
that I-I-I told Mama...

789
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:47,200
that I got feelings for you.

790
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:50,920
Well, welcome to your manhood,
Bobby Boucher.

791
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:53,800
When we get a little more time,
I'll welcome you properly.

792
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:56,160
Yes, once again, I'm not quite sure
what that means, but...

793
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:58,080
You know, we should get goin'.

794
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:00,000
I told the coach that
I'd drive to the game with him.

795
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,240
I was with you from two to four
last night. You-You tell them.

796
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:13,120
Bobby, your mama got sick this mornin'.
She's in the hospital.

797
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,720
Mama, what have I done?

798
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,640
I'm so sorry, Mama.

799
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:27,400
Doctors say... they can't figure out
what's wrong with her.

800
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:29,560
But I know what's wrong.

801
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:31,760
She got a broken heart
because of me.

802
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:33,840
Bobby, that's ridiculous.

803
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:38,440
Everybody else in this town
turn on me at the drop of a hat.

804
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:41,840
Mama is the only one who really cares
if I live or die.

805
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,280
She my whole world.

806
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:48,400
Will you just
leave us alone?

807
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:51,720
She'll be fine, Bobby.
We better get going.

808
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:54,240
God knows what the team is doing
with just Farmer Fran watching them.

809
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:19,960
You really made it look like home.

810
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:29,600
How's that, Steve?

811
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:49,360
Take a look. The crowd has
never been bigger. You know why?

812
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,840
Look who's on the television, Mama.

813
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:53,760
The devil.

814
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,680
500,000 intimate...

815
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:08,200
Who there? Who there?

816
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:23,920
Three, two, one!

817
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,760
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year, Mama.

818
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:48,640
Waterboy! Waterboy!

819
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:52,360
Waterboy! Waterboy!

820
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:18,360
Bobby Boucher, all these folks
are here tonight...

821
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:20,480
to tell you that
they're sorry...

822
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:22,520
that they're sorry
for not supportin' you...

823
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:24,960
when it meant the most.

824
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,800
But you do have friends,
and one of 'em wants to say somethin'.

825
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:30,760
Come on.

826
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:37,360
I am not what you
would call a handsome man.

827
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:42,160
The good Lord chose not
to bless me with...

828
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:47,680
with charm, athletic ability
or a fully functional brain.

829
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,960
You see,
you're an inspiration...

830
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:56,440
to all of us who,
who weren't born handsome...

831
01:00:56,520 --> 01:01:01,720
and charming
and cool and...

832
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:07,840
- I can't! I can't!
- It's okay.

833
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:12,240
Bobby, if your mama
could only hear us right now,

834
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:14,720
we would tell her...

835
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:17,680
what a fine boy she raised,

836
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:21,120
and how much your playing football
means to this town.

837
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:25,560
But she can't hear you,
'cause she's unconscious.

838
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:30,040
I'm sorry
to disappoint you all,

839
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:32,640
but please keep
your voices down...

840
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:35,240
so my mama
can get her rest.

841
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:47,240
Well, wake her ass up!
We gotta win tomorrow!

842
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:12,280
Mama! Thank God, you're okay.
I'm so sorry.

843
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:14,720
I was so bad, Mama.
You were right about everything.

844
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:16,960
- I've been a real knucklehead.
- Oh, hush, baby.

845
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,280
You should've seen this
a long time ago.

846
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:22,200
Oh, my word!

847
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:24,880
- Is that my daddy?
- No, no.

848
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:27,960
That's a guy I dated
before I met your father.

849
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:30,680
Oh, you could iron
a shirt on his stomach.

850
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:34,240
Well, that was lust, not love.
Turn the page.

851
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,480
There's your daddy.

852
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:41,880
- So handsome.
- Oh.

853
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:43,800
Read on.

854
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:48,320
"Dear Helen."
Who's Helen?

855
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:52,160
That's my first name, Bobby.

856
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:54,720
Ohh!

857
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:58,640
"I have arrived here
in New Orleans.

858
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:01,640
"It is even more beautiful
than in the picture books.

859
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:04,320
"I'm sure I'll have
no problem finding work,

860
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:08,360
"so you can expect my next letter
to contain lots of money.

861
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:10,400
Your loving husband, Robert."

862
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:12,360
That's nice, Mama.

863
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:16,600
"Dear Helen."
That's you.

864
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:19,760
"I found a job
as a lemonade vendor,

865
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:21,840
"but sorry,
no money yet.

866
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:24,440
"New Orleans is
an expensive city.

867
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:28,160
"Expensive, but fun.
Hope all is well.

868
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:30,760
Robert."

869
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:33,240
"To Whom It May Concern:

870
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:36,040
"This will be my last letter.

871
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:39,640
"We have grown apart
over these last six weeks.

872
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:43,440
"I now have
two loves in my life:

873
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:47,800
"big-city livin' and
a voodoo woman named Phyllis.

874
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:50,720
Ciao, Roberto."

875
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:53,960
He changed his name
to Roberto.

876
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:56,560
I guess he thought
it was more exotic.

877
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:59,480
But Mama says that...
I mean, you say that...

878
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:03,680
Bobby, your daddy didn't
go into no Peace Corps.

879
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:07,280
He deserted us, baby.

880
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:10,960
No, no, Mama.
You-You...

881
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:13,640
You shouldn't be dredgin' up these
painful memories in your condition.

882
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:16,480
Oh, hush. Your mama's
as healthy as an ox,

883
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:18,880
and as dumb as one to boot.

884
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:21,280
I was so scared
you'd abandon me too.

885
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:26,440
And I made you abandon
all those people who depend on ya.

886
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:29,200
I hid you away from the world,
Bobby Boucher.

887
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:32,520
But I can't hog you
to myself no more,

888
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:35,760
because everyone's seen
how wonderful you are.

889
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:40,480
- Oh, Mama!
- Now.

890
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:46,800
You go play fool's ball
with your friends.

891
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:49,760
Welcome to ABC's coverage
of the Bourbon Bowl.

892
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:53,160
Good afternoon, everybody.
I'm Brent Musburger,
along with my colleague, Dan Fouts.

893
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:56,840
And the big story here, Dan, is a game
that's lost some of its luster...

894
01:04:56,920 --> 01:05:00,440
without its star player,
the waterboy Bobby Boucher.

895
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:03,200
You know, Red's got a couple
of solid early rounders out there.

896
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:06,760
I know, but I really wanted to scout
that waterboy. Reminds me of Greg Lloyd.

897
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:09,160
- Naw. "Hack" Thomas.
- Whatever.

898
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:11,080
Is she ready?

899
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:13,800
Oh, yeah.
She's more than ready.

900
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:17,720
Come on, Bobby!
You'll miss the boat!

901
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:23,240
Let's go, ladies.

902
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:30,600
We are underway!

903
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:33,120
The opening kickoff
is a beauty!

904
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,600
Holdsworth is gonna bring it out
from nine yards deep.

905
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:40,240
Come on.

906
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:42,480
Yeah!

907
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:46,840
Dan, they're showing no respect
for this team without Boucher.

908
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:50,120
Good reason, Brent.
109 yards untouched.

909
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:52,720
Touchdown, Cougars! They strike first.

910
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:01,520
Time running down in the first quarter.

911
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:03,760
Cougars lead is 17-0.

912
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:07,480
Set!

913
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:09,440
Three! Thirty-three!

914
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:13,000
Three! Thirty-three! Hut!

915
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:17,480
Dan, that quarterback can't even
get the ball off before he's hit.

916
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:19,680
It's as if they're in
the offensive huddle with him.

917
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:25,880
Are you gonna finish
that hot dog, Jimmy?

918
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:28,160
Ugh! Now I'm not.

919
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:31,080
Mama, you think
we'll make it on time?

920
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:34,880
Hang on! I'll show you what
A.J. Foyt taught me.

921
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:41,400
That's the end of
the half. The Cougars are dominating.

922
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:45,240
Let's hope the Mud Dogs
can make some adjustments.

923
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:47,160
- Well, they better, 'cause they suck.
- Mm-hmm.

924
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:55,000
Anybody got an idea?

925
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:00,800
Hey.

926
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:06,560
Remember the time Bobby tackled
the referee by mistake?

927
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:08,920
Yeah, that was pretty funny.

928
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:11,280
How about the time he tackled
the guy from Louisville...

929
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:14,080
and threw him into the stands?

930
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:20,320
Y'all remember when he intercepted
the ball and his pants fell off?

931
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:23,640
And then he ran for
the touchdown, bare-assed.

932
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:29,760
Remember the time Bobby...

933
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:38,800
Remember when Bobby Boucher
showed up at halftime and the
Mud Dogs won the Bourbon Bowl?

934
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:49,560
Hey, sorry about givin' you
so much shit this year.

935
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:51,840
You're the heart and soul
of this team, Bobby.

936
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:54,520
Ain't one of us could've
passed that test.

937
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:58,240
Thank you all so much
for being my friends.

938
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:01,600
Well, let's wait till later
to hold hands and kiss.
We got a Bowl game to win.

939
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:03,400
- Right?
- Yeah!

940
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:05,800
- Two, three!
- Mud Dogs! Woof!

941
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:08,680
In a dramatic turn of events,

942
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:11,720
Bobby Boucher
just arrived at halftime.

943
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:16,000
And on a fan boat, Brent. His mother
drove him right into the stadium.

944
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:27,400
Waterboy! Waterboy!

945
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:30,680
Waterboy! Waterboy!

946
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:33,520
Waterboy! Waterboy!

947
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:36,200
Fool's ball's
not for the devil.

948
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:38,120
It's for my Bobby.

949
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:42,160
Time to open up
some whoop-ass.

950
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,680
Shit, he showed up.
All right, look.

951
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:55,880
Just relax. Relax. Go in there and
do exactly like we planned. Go, go, go!

952
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:58,720
This could be the start
of some high drama, folks.

953
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:00,960
Or are the Mud Dogs
too far behind?

954
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:03,520
Bobby Boucher
is on defense.

955
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:06,960
The Cougars are coming out
from their own 20 yard line.
- Hut! Hut!

956
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:09,520
The pitch.
It's a reverse!

957
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:12,000
Boucher's not fooled.

958
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:14,800
Fumble!
Robideaux's got it!

959
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:16,520
Touchdown, Mud Dogs!

960
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:22,160
- Boy, Boucher knocked
the poop out of him.
- "Poop"?

961
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:27,160
Slap hands!
Slap hands!

962
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:32,960
Drink up, now. I want you girls to
sober up. Have faith in my Bobby.

963
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:36,000
The Mud Dogs are
faced with yet another third and long.

964
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:38,080
- Hut!
- Grenouille back to pass.

965
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:43,280
He's gonna be stuffed again!
And the Mud Dogs offense is
still unable to move that ball.

966
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:46,480
But the way their defense
is fired up, they still have
a shot at winning this game.

967
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:48,560
Blake, come here. Look.

968
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:51,960
Now, what if we, uh...

969
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:57,320
Trust me. Go, go, go, go, go.

970
01:09:57,400 --> 01:10:01,720
The Cougars lead 27-7 in
the middle of the third quarter.

971
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:03,760
And he takes a knee?

972
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:07,480
Y'all gonna play or what?

973
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:10,720
How do you all like my new offense?

974
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:15,440
All right, it's second and 12...

975
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:19,040
- as the Cougars line up on the ball.
- Hut! Hut!

976
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:24,320
What is Red Beaulieu doing,
refusing to play offense?

977
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:27,080
- Dan, this is bizarre.
- No, it's not, Brent.

978
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:30,360
It's brilliant, because Red is
taking the waterboy out of the game.

979
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:32,880
By kneeling down
three times and punting,

980
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:34,880
he's gonna make the Mud Dog
offense try to beat him.

981
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:37,320
And the way they're playing
today, that's impossible.

982
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:39,360
Well, the Mud Dog's
most valuable player,

983
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:42,520
the linebacker they call "the Waterboy,"
is now powerless.

984
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:47,560
That means Coach Klein will have
to find another way to outfox Red.

985
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:51,880
Mud Dogs call a time-out.

986
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,560
Mr. Coach Klein. Mr. Coach Klein!

987
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:57,240
Mr. Coach Klein!

988
01:10:57,320 --> 01:11:01,360
- Where are you going?
- I was just gonna get a hot pretzel.

989
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:04,200
Mr. Coach Klein, are you afraid
of Red Beaulieu?

990
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:09,680
I am petrified of him.

991
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:12,720
Well, why don't you pretend
that Red Beaulieu...

992
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:14,880
is somebody that
you're-you're not afraid of.

993
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:17,600
- Pretend?
- Yes.

994
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:20,160
Visualize somebody
you're not afraid of.

995
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:23,280
- And then attack, like you told me.
- I'll try.

996
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:26,200
Well, he's right over there.

997
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:39,200
Little baby.

998
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:41,680
Yeah.

999
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:46,480
Hello, little baby.

1000
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,800
A poo-poo?
Do you have a poo-poo?

1001
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:53,680
Yes.

1002
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:56,120
Okay. Now.

1003
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:58,520
This is what we're gonna do.
He's gonna come here...

1004
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:09,320
Come and get
this one, Cougars.

1005
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:11,720
Red, 22! Hike!

1006
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:14,680
Snap to Grenouille. A reverse!

1007
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:18,360
No, it's a double reverse!
Oh, what a block!

1008
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:20,240
And Boudier springs free!

1009
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:24,920
Trouble! Lateral!
Got him! What a play!

1010
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:28,640
Grenouille to the 15!
To the 10! To the 5!

1011
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:30,960
- Touchdown, Mud Dogs!
- Well, well, well.

1012
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:33,600
I guess Coach Klein does have
a few tricks up his sleeve after all.

1013
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:37,040
What the hell...
What the hell is this? Huh?

1014
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:40,440
We go from a championship
football team to a bunch of dogs!

1015
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:43,840
Right now, we're going to go down to
the sidelines and our man, Lynn Swann.

1016
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:46,000
Swannie, what do
you have for us?

1017
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:47,920
I'm with Vicki Vallencourt,
who's taking over...

1018
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,880
Bobby Boucher's water duties
for this important game.

1019
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:53,880
Oh, I'm not takin' over.
I'm just tryin' not to screw up too bad.

1020
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:57,160
Well, let me ask you this.
What's your prediction for
the rest of this ball game?

1021
01:12:57,240 --> 01:12:59,200
Mud Dogs are gonna win,
30 to 27.

1022
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:01,920
That's very interesting.
How'd you come up with that guess?

1023
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:05,280
Guess? That ain't no guess!
That's what it's gonna be.

1024
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:08,240
- Okay. That's fine.
- Oh! Be careful down there, Swannie.

1025
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:14,080
All right.
Meaney. Where's Meaney?

1026
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:16,040
- Meaney?
- Here, Coach.

1027
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:19,520
- Get in there and let's see if
that waterboy can stop you.
- Yes, sir!

1028
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:23,680
Red is sending his best defender in
as a running back?

1029
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:26,200
What do you make of this, Dan?

1030
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:28,480
Well, Brent, he's gotta find
some way to neutralize the waterboy.

1031
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:31,840
He probably thinks that Meaney
will just pound it in there like
Fridge used to do for the Bears.

1032
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:35,440
Hey, Waterboy! Is your girlfriend
gonna save you again?

1033
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:37,600
Oh, no, sir. I'm gonna take matters
into my own hands.

1034
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:41,600
- You'll see.
- Bridge the hole!
Your ass is mine! Whoo!

1035
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:44,480
Whoo! Whoo!

1036
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:46,560
You sound like a...
a big choo-choo train.

1037
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:50,000
Whoo!

1038
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:59,400
Power bomb, compliments
of Captain Insano.

1039
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:08,680
All right, field goal.
Field goal. Go.

1040
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:12,040
- Derek. Derek!
- Yeah.

1041
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:15,160
Visualize the attack.
Go kick the ball. Kick it.

1042
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:17,000
Hut!

1043
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:20,480
How you doin', boy?

1044
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:23,040
No, no, no!

1045
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:48,480
What the hell is that?

1046
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:57,680
Where the hell is... What the hell
is he up to? That ain't in here! Huh?

1047
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:59,560
Hey!

1048
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:01,600
Down by ten late in the fourth quarter,

1049
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:04,160
Coach Klein
opts for the field goal.

1050
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:07,680
Then they have to hope for the onside
kick and a touchdown to tie the game.

1051
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:11,840
Dan, look what we have here.
Boucher's in the game as a blocker.

1052
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:14,160
Last game of the year, Brent.
Can't hold anything back now.

1053
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:19,120
Set!

1054
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:23,840
The snap. It's a fake!

1055
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:30,560
Boucher's out in front!
A great block!

1056
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:33,840
And a second one!

1057
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:36,320
Touchdown, Mud Dogs!

1058
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:39,800
- Boucher led him all the way!
- Yeah!

1059
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:43,960
Red Beaulieu
is steaming, Dan.

1060
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:46,320
Brent, he sees his
perfect season slipping away.

1061
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:49,880
The Cougar's lead
is down to three.

1062
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:57,520
The Mud Dogs need the ball back if
they're gonna have a shot at overtime.

1063
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:01,080
And Bobby Boucher is
now on the kickoff team.

1064
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:04,640
- Last game of the year, Brent.
Can't hold anything back now.
- I know.

1065
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:08,000
Who's it gonna be?

1066
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:11,520
Who's it gonna be?
Who's it gonna be?

1067
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:17,680
Oh, yeah. There's my bitch.

1068
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:20,160
Remember,
the ball must travel ten yards.

1069
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:24,560
It's loose!

1070
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:27,600
- Mud Dogs football! Mud Dogs football!
- All right!

1071
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:29,720
Mama, I got the football!
I got it...

1072
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:32,320
Oh, what a vicious hit!
That was a cheap shot.

1073
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:34,160
Oh!

1074
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:36,640
And what a dumb penalty.

1075
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:39,920
That puts the Mud Dogs
in field goal range for the tie.

1076
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,360
- Dan, I'm not sure that Boucher
is able to get back up.
- Oh, my baby!

1077
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:52,160
It's still cold.

1078
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:55,160
Excuse me. Out of my way.

1079
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:00,960
Dan, you hate
to see this happen.

1080
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:11,920
Now, that's
high quality H2O.

1081
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:15,840
Come on, now!
Make it happen, Bobby!

1082
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:21,920
The waterboy
just needed some water.

1083
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:26,400
- Wow, Dan. You think that up
all by yourself?
- Shut up, Brent.

1084
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:31,200
Are you okay?

1085
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:33,400
He tried to open up a can
of whoop-ass on me. I wouldn't let him.

1086
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:37,120
Listen, I have an idea for the last
play. You haven't done this before.

1087
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:39,040
All right? The offense
is gonna line up like this.

1088
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:40,960
- Yeah.
- You're gonna be right here.

1089
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,160
There'll be no tie here today.

1090
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:46,720
Coach Klein is sending
his offense back on to the field.

1091
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:48,840
He's going for
the win right now.

1092
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:50,760
Yeah, this is
a real gutsy call, Brent.

1093
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:52,720
He'll either be a hero
or a goat because of this.

1094
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:57,280
And Dan,
Bobby Boucher is back on the field.

1095
01:17:57,320 --> 01:18:01,120
He is now playing offense!
We know. We know.

1096
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:04,440
Meaney, if they give
that Waterboy the football,

1097
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:06,360
I don't care if you
have to stab him!

1098
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:08,640
Do not let him get away.
Do you understand me?

1099
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:12,320
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir!
- Do you understand me? Get in there!

1100
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:14,640
Break!

1101
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:24,960
- I'm ready, friend.
- Let's do it, Bobby.

1102
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:28,480
Set! Set!

1103
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:31,840
Forty-three! Set!
Forty-three! Hut, hut!

1104
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,840
Touchdown! They win it!
The Mud Dogs win it!

1105
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:53,040
Bobby Boucher's the hero! He's gone
from waterboy, Dan, to saviour!

1106
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:55,200
And it's because he didn't
hold anything back!

1107
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:58,720
Well, Swannie's down on the field
with our hero, so let's go to Lynn now!

1108
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:05,360
We did it! I can't believe it!
I can't believe it!

1109
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:08,320
- Vicki, I love you!
- Whoo! I love you too, baby.

1110
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:12,000
We're the champions!

1111
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:15,880
Mr. Coach Klein, you got your manhood!
You got your manhood!

1112
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:19,080
Bobby, congratulations.
You're the M.V.P. of the Bourbon Bowl.

1113
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:21,000
How do you feel?

1114
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:24,520
I love Mama!

1115
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:44,520
Lookin' sharp, Bobby!

1116
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:46,440
You the man, Bobby!

1117
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:49,120
Bobby, I've been dreading
this day for a long time.

1118
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:52,480
- But you got yourself a fine woman.
- Oh, thank you, Mama.

1119
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:55,360
Good luck, son.

1120
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:57,320
This is the best day
of my life!

1121
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:00,800
You just wait till tonight.

1122
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:03,520
- What's gonna happen tonight?
- You'll see.

1123
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:08,680
You can do it!
You can do it all night long!

1124
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,760
I'm gonna go do it!

1125
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:22,880
Bobby, it's me!

1126
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:26,400
- Your daddy, Roberto.
- Daddy?

1127
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:31,200
I've seen you on the ESPN
when they was talkin' about
you being drafted by the NFL.

1128
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:34,800
Not going to the NFL.
I'm gonna stay in school and graduate.

1129
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:38,600
The hell with school, dopey! Take the
money! You and me could be partners,

1130
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:42,080
just like that Tiger Woods
and his daddy.

1131
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:44,520
Uh-oh.

1132
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:53,360
- Nice hit, Mama.
- Thanks, baby.

1133
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:55,720
Now, you go on and have
some fun becoming a man.

1134
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:59,050
