- Deanne, you look great.
- I do?

176
00:09:13,412 --> 00:09:16,039
My wife's over there.
Go and say hi. Children.

177
00:09:16,215 --> 00:09:18,274
I see that ass is still growing.

178
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:20,816
Got a little Kardashian in there.

179
00:09:20,985 --> 00:09:24,513
Well, you've kind of turned into a little
Michael Vick thing, if he was bulimic.

Hi, Roxanne.

182
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,985
I don't know if you remember me.
I was at your wedding.

183
00:09:31,163 --> 00:09:34,427
I was the one that was table dancing
all night. Deanne McKenzie.

184
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,793
Of course.

185
00:09:35,967 --> 00:09:38,493
- Deanne, hello.
- Hi, good to see you.

186
00:09:38,669 --> 00:09:40,034
Oh, my God,
you're glowing.

187
00:09:40,239 --> 00:09:43,332
You look so beautiful
with your pregnancy.

188
00:09:44,342 --> 00:09:46,674

are you talking about?

your face. You were like, "Huh?"

Mama Ronzoni got big, huh?

194
00:10:00,259 --> 00:10:02,625
Look at this handsome hunk
of prosciutto.

195
00:10:02,793 --> 00:10:05,159
And such a big success.

196
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:07,559
Come on, give Mama a kiss.

197
00:10:09,735 --> 00:10:11,965
Can I get a...?
Can I get a cheek at all?

198
00:10:12,136 --> 00:10:16,301
I got you, I got you. Poked in the eye
by the hat, but I'm all right.

199
00:10:17,109 --> 00:10:19,838
How about your son-in-law here,
I hear he's a house husband now.

200

Pfft! My daughter's gotta bust
her hump all day to pay the bills

while dummy here stays home
and cleans.

202
00:10:26,118 --> 00:10:28,381
I don't know how you could
talk to me like that

203
00:10:28,553 --> 00:10:31,523
when you look like Idi Amin
with a propeller on your head.

204
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:34,351
- That's nice that he could...
- Roxanne, this is my mother.

205
00:10:34,525 --> 00:10:39,053
Hello, Mama Ronzoni, I'm so pleased
to meet you. I'm Little Lenny's wife.

206
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:43,065
Ooh. What a spicy quesadilla
you got yourself, Lenny.

207
00:10:43,235 --> 00:10:45,293
Yeah, she tastes great.

208
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:47,630

the phone off there, Greg?

Yeah, but it's my massage therapist.

their funeral on?

I'm sorry, death makes me weird.

Still using Palmolive?

Hey, what's up, Lenny?

220
00:11:12,264 --> 00:11:14,528
Buddy, I thought you were
gonna start working out.

- What does that mean?
- Um, you're fat.

healing process, I'm cool with it.

that you guys rented
the Earnshaw lake house for us

- What?

to rent it for a whole weekend.

306

Because it's a holiday. They won't
rent it to you for one night.

It's your money too, isn't it?

Yeah, it's your money,
it's his money, it's my money.

Let's put all our cash
in a pile and split it. Heh, heh.

on your adding machine.

Now I know what happened
to the fish tank.

323
00:15:50,942 --> 00:15:53,172
PASTOR: Coach Robert
"The Buzzer" Ferdinando

324
00:15:53,345 --> 00:15:55,278
was a caretaker by profession.

325
00:15:55,447 --> 00:15:59,907
What a wonderful word to describe
his devotion to his fellow man.

326
00:16:00,085 --> 00:16:02,519
He truly took care.

327
00:16:03,153 --> 00:16:05,212
When Robert knew
that his time was short,

328
00:16:05,389 --> 00:16:07,914
he told me there was
one specific man he wanted

329
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,356
to say a few words
to memorialize him.

330
00:16:10,528 --> 00:16:13,928
So I'd like to ask Lenny Feder
to come up now.

331
00:16:21,873 --> 00:16:24,602
I'm sorry, I'm not prepared at all.

332
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:27,176
I feel very honored

333
00:16:28,145 --> 00:16:30,205
that coach asked me
to do this, but, uh...

334
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:36,349
I also feel terrible because
I haven't seen the coach in so long.

335
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,979
And he always wanted me to come
to town and see him

336
00:16:40,158 --> 00:16:43,991
and I got caught up in what I've
been doing and I regret it.

337
00:16:44,763 --> 00:16:47,822
I understand that the
St. Mark's team of 1978

338
00:16:47,999 --> 00:16:52,993
was the only championship team
that the coach ever had, and, uh,

339
00:16:53,171 --> 00:16:55,639
that's very impressive,
I gotta say,

340
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,503
judging from the talent

00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:13,095
So, what's with that Labradoodle?
It sounds like Stephen Hawking.

508
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,932
Curly, he had
his vocal cords clipped.

509
00:25:16,106 --> 00:25:18,007
A neighbor filed a complaint,

510
00:25:18,209 --> 00:25:22,269
so it was either clip the cords
or put Curly down.

511
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:25,607
Wrong choice.

512
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:28,444
Come on, he's part
of the family, you know?

513
00:25:28,618 --> 00:25:31,105
Imagine when a burglar
comes over and hears that.

514
00:25:31,131 --> 00:25:32,272
He must run in terror.

515
00:25:32,423 --> 00:25:34,481

doing in the house?"

Lamonsoff, your son.

00:25:37,795 --> 00:25:40,319
What's with the boob thing?
Isn't the kid a little old?

519
00:25:40,498 --> 00:25:42,761
He'll be rubbing her boob
with his beard soon.

520
00:25:42,933 --> 00:25:45,459
He's gonna get a milk
mustache on a real mustache.

521
00:25:45,484 --> 00:25:46,622
That won't look right.

522
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:48,829
That kid, when he's 10,
on his bike,

basket, he's gonna be like,

Chain saw pedicure, 50 points.</i>

526
00:25:58,782 --> 00:26:01,250
Why are they inside
right now, anyways?

527
00:26:01,419 --> 00:26:03,886
Why would they not come out
here and enjoy the lake

528
00:26:04,055 --> 00:26:05,521
or do something
in the woods?

529
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:08,056
There wasn't a time of day
that I wasn't outside.

530
00:26:08,259 --> 00:26:11,125

always... We were never in.

No more texting.

Just from now on, while we're
here, stay outside and play.

supposed to do?

540
00:26:33,718 --> 00:26:38,051
Just play like normal kids.
Come on, move it. Where's Becky?

541
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:41,025
Let's go. Let me show you
how the Pilgrims used to hang.

542
00:26:41,092 --> 00:26:45,494
When we were kids, your dad used to
talk us into doing the craziest stuff.

543
00:26:45,663 --> 00:26:46,686
That's right.

544
00:26:46,864 --> 00:26:49,923
Yeah, I remember one time,
we got our shower curtains,

545
00:26:50,101 --> 00:26:53,229
put them in shopping carts
and went shopping cart sailing.

546
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:54,529
Wait, how did you steer?

547
00:26:54,704 --> 00:26:56,673
- Well, we didn't.
- How'd you stop?

548
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,401
You just smashed into something.
That was the fun part.

549
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:01,510
We used to shoot
bottle rockets at each other.

doesn't make you wanna go nuts?

Um, I'm not sure.

noise, but that could've been anything.

I hide them under my clothes
in the bottom of the hamper.

It's great because the smell in my
sweat socks mask the chocolate smell.

We're normal?

1670
01:19:54,247 --> 01:19:57,979
I was scared to tell you. It was
easier for me to keep it a secret.

there are secrets.

Roxanne, I just... I...

1674

Our kids are becoming nutty,
snotty, spoiled...

1675
01:20:10,765 --> 01:20:13,324
- We got a nanny, we got...
- So she is a nanny.

1676
01:20:13,501 --> 01:20:14,899
No, no, no. She's not a nanny.

1677
01:20:15,069 --> 01:20:16,899
Of course she's a nanny.

1678
01:20:17,070 --> 01:20:19,095
When does the lying stop?

1679
01:20:19,273 --> 01:20:20,569
It stops right after this.

1680
01:20:20,742 --> 01:20:22,676
She's more of an au pair.
Not a nanny.

I won't lie to you ever again.
I swear to God.

They can't help themselves.

1687
01:20:36,524 --> 01:20:38,457

Oh, please.
The nanny.

1690
01:20:43,564 --> 01:20:44,895
KURT:
What about the nanny?

1691
01:20:45,065 --> 01:20:47,091
You have a thing for her.

1692
01:20:47,268 --> 01:20:51,261
I do not have a thing for the nanny.
I'm a married man. Period.

1693
01:20:51,706 --> 01:20:55,335

with a woman that wasn't going,

1694
01:20:55,510 --> 01:20:59,310
"Where's this?" and
"Did you pick up that?" Yeah.

1695

nice conversations with me.

you're just tired all the time.

Umberto Denunzio like I told you.

the one that's pregnant now, Mama.

for granted, and I'm sorry.

I'm actually not a part owner

I don't even work there

1713

I got laid off in April.

But I rented the Caddy

it's not my place, but, uh...

1730

I am older than anyone here.

Well, despite the joking and
the razzing, I see a lot of love here.

I was so calm, but inside?

of where you're going.
