2
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,403
 Sweetheart.

3
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,966
Mmm?

4
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:17,400
Go over to
the window right now

5
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:21,007
and open it as
wide as you can.

6
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,043
Please let me sleep.

7
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,161


8
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,766
I think your
mother's here from Mexico,

9
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,604
and she needs to leave.

10
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,728
Open the window now.

11
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,490
 Why don't you
open it, you lazy...

12
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:48,766


13
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,887


14
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,960


15
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,971
Somebody help!

16
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:56,723
Close your mouth!

17
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:04,647
No way. Can I ride him?

18
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:11,600


19
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,561


20
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:23,484
A deer!

21
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,730


22
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,562
 Okay.

23
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,807
Daddy,
I left the front door open

24
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,081
in case any animals
wanted to come in.

25
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:45,490
You did, huh?
And one did.

26
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,329
Yeah.
Yeah, one crazy-ass one.

27
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,243
Oh, no, you did a nice thing,
sweetheart.

28
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,003
Greg, I'm gonna need a bat!

29
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:53,525
Daddy, no!

30
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:55,004
No, no, I'm not
going to hit the deer.

31
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:58,003
I'm just going to massage his
head for a little bit with it.

32
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:00,207
Okay, come on, come on.

33
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,681


34
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:08,284
He's right here.

35
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,203
He's eating Bowser's food.

36
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,360
Shh.

37
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:12,930
Okay, he knows we're here now.

38
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,127
Stay. Stay.

39
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,408
What's he looking at?

40
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,883
Move your doll towards me.

41
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,121
And back to you.

42
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,968
Towards me.

43
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,769
Back to you.

44
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,126
Three times, fast.

45
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,770
Give me that thing.

46
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,126
Mr. Gigglesworth?

47
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,570
No, don't worry.
Give it to me.

48
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:37,606
Go on. It's okay.
It's okay.

49
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,727
Put it in my hand.

50
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,131
Roxanne, take them in there.

51
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,968
Over there.

52
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:45,168
Hey, dude.
You like this guy?

53
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,600
Huh?

54
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,966
You want to play with him?

55
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,843
All right, let's go
play in the other room.

56
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,804
Come on. Come on, man.

57
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,405
Slowly walk with me.

58
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:58,050
I said slowly.

59
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,121
No.

60
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:00,926
Ah!Ah!

61
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,046
Get out of the way!

62
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,807
Oh, my God!

63
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:10,009
Problem solved.

64
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,360
Mr. Gigglesworth!
Daddy, he's killing him!

65
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:16,363
A new problem begins.

66
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,165
I'm sorry.

67
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,165
Is that your bra, Mrs. Feder?

68
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000


69
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:24,204
Easy.

70
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:25,281
Ew.

71
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:27,565
It is nice.

72
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:29,244
Thank you, all right.
Cool, yeah.

73
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:30,560
Yeah, come on.

74
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:35,961
28?

75
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,408
Yes.

76
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,403
35.

77
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,927
That's right again,
smarty-pants.

78
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,281
Hi, Dad.

79
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,691
Hey, Bean,
working on the math, huh?

80
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,086
Yep-

81
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:54,242
Mommy said if I get all
my math questions right,

82
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:56,807
I get to ride my bike to
school with Becky Feder.

83
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:01,129
Really? Okay, Bean, well,
what's seven plus nine?

84
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,689
Seventy-nine.

85
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:05,641
Is he a little boy
or a computer?

86
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,882
'Cause {HOARSELY}
I can't figure it out.

87
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,606
Don't destroy his confidence.

88
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,283
Happy summer, everybody.

89
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,480
ERIC= Whoa.

90
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,485
Okay, you sure you want to go
with those boots, honey?

91
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,288
I know you
bedazzled them yourself.

92
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,202
I'm just wondering
if they'll attract

93
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,283
too much attention,
you know, from outer space.

94
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,168
It's the last day of school,

95
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,889
and Mom says I'm
free to express myself.

96
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:31,447
Oh, building the confidence
right here with R2-D2.

97
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:35,567
Confidence. K-O-B-R-Q-V-Y.

98
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:36,687
Confidence.

99
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:38,170
Well, we're not gonna have to
pay for college.

100
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,048
That's for sure.


101
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,646
Well, looks like a horse took
a dump in Ronnie's diaper.

102
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,007
You're gonna need federal aid
to clean that up.

103
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:49,562
Ronnie, honey, did a doo-doo
grenade go off in your diaper?

104
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:50,971
You gonna change it?

105
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,485
That's not my son,
that's your son.

106
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,449
Ah ha ha! Yesterday
was my diaper day.

107
00:05:55,519 --> 00:06:00,127
Today he is all yours, and
it's gonna get nasty. Whoo!

108
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:02,249
 Go, Ronnie.

109
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,209
Go, Ronnie, go, Ronnie.
ANDRE= Go, Ronnie, go, Ronnie.

110
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:05,485
He looks like Nicki Minaj

111
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,040
trying to shake her butt
implants back into place.

112
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,326
BOTH= Go, Ronnie, go, Ronnie.

113
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:10,725
Come on, Ronnie.

114
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,040
Go, Ronnie.

115
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,723
You got a lot of
appointments today, sweetie?

116
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,370
Nah, just one repair job.

117
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:16,771
Very special.

118
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:18,524
All right, I'm going in.

119
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:22,521
What is...

120
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,963
What is this?

121
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:31,564
A necklace?

122
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:34,201
Happy 20th anniversary, babe.

123
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:36,327
Wow, Dad, you remembered.

124
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,288
Oh, yeah.

125
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:43,447
Mom didn't.

126
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,045
Oh! That's cold.

127
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,567
MARCUS= I think I'm gonna
bust out of here.

128
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,562
<i>WOMAN= So he gets off
the train and nobody's there?</i>

129
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,728
<i>Braden needs to spend
at least one summer with you</i>

130
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,247
<i>so he can say he has a dad,
you deadbeat, Higgins.</i>

131
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,605
Well, not to be mean,

132
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,331
but I'm not even
1,000% sure who you are.

133
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:02,762
<i>WOMAN= I was up from Florida.</i>

134
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,045
<i>Right in
the middle of making out,</i>

135
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,043
<i>I got a really bad
case of the hiccups.</i>

136
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,122
Hiccups McGee?

137
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,643
Oh, my God, I have a kid I don't
know about with Hiccups McGee?

138
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,449
And no offense,
but I'm gonna have to ask

139
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:16,725
for a DNA test, you know,

140
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,326
because you just never...

141
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:23,127
No need.

142
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,850
Later, Hiccups.

143
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:39,324
You're him.

144
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:41,483
Yeah, without the hat.


145
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,721
It's actually a good likeness.

146
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,201
How you doing, man?

147
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:48,526
I'm your dad.

148
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,406
Nice to see you, Braden.

149
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,403
That's strike one.

150
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:56,043
Good news is, you get...

151
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,968
Unlimited amount of strikes.

152
00:07:58,399 --> 00:07:59,401
Um...

153
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,163
How about I
take you to school?

154
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,403
No school.

155
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,163
Summertime.
Oh.

156
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,891
Not yet. One more day.
I know, it's a drag.

157
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:10,531
Normally I'd let you just
blow it off and play hooky,

158
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,887
but I'm volunteering
at the soup kitchen today,

159
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,529
so when I'm done,

160
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,887
I'll come pick you
up and we'll hang out.

161
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:18,404
I got you this, but...

162
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,689
Obviously you're,
like, 13, so I don't know,

163
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,204
but it's actually pretty nice

164
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:25,646
and cute, and you should
out the head off it, okay.

165
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,125
Well, let's get going.

166
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,805
Yo, yo,
yo, yo, don't forget this.

167
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,365
Is it a gift?

168
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,681
No, it's the Gigglesworth
massacre.

169
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:36,888
I told Becky you could
sew it back together for her.

170
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,165
What?

171
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,207
Martha Stewart
couldn't fix this.

172
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:41,360
Come on.

173
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,365
Oh, but you're such a good daddy
for picking up all the pieces.

174
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,043
That's why I've been thinking,

175
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,690
we moved back
here to your hometown

176
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:51,365
so we could have more quality
time with our family, right?

177
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,600
That's right.

178
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:56,725
How would you
feel about expanding?

179
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:57,801
Having another kid?

180
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:58,966
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

181
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,726
Oh, but it's perfect
right now, you know?

182
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:05,201
If I buy one large pizza,
Greg gets two pieces,

183
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,931
Keith gets two, Becky gets
one, you get one, I get four.

184
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,240
It's kind of perfect,
you know.

185
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,850
I don't want to have
to buy another pie.

186
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,527
<i>Why don't you go on a diet,
fat gordo Aeste?</i>

187
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:16,448
Come on, I've had
a job since I'm 16.

188
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:18,442
It's the first time
I've got a free schedule.

189
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:20,090
I'm just enjoying the fun.

190
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:22,730
Don't forget Becky's
ballet recital at 11=00.

191
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:24,683
I got to go to that?

192
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:26,966
I mean, I get to
go to that? Great.

193
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:30,767
I'm saying, that's... I thought it was sold out.
That's great news.

194
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,963
Have the best last day of
school, my gorgeous children!

195
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:35,326
I love you all!

196
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:36,845
Bye, Mom.
Bye, Mom, bye.

197
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:39,048
KEITHIE= Yeah,
last day of school, Greg.

198
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:41,082
Last chance to ask
out Nancy Arbuckle.

199
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:43,241
Nancy Arbuckle... What's that?
You like a girl?

200
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,765
Is that why you've been taking
the long showers?

201
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,365
No, I'm conditioning
my hair.

202
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,051
That's all I do in the shower...
Condition my hair.

203
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,360
That's not what
the deer told me.

204
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,645
That deer's a liar.

205
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,926


206
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,082
I heard too much conditioning
can make you go blind.

207
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,530
What? Where'd you hear that?

208
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,681
Higgins.

209
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,886
I should kill him.

210
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,844
He's too chicken
to ask her out, Dad,

211
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,563
'cause she's
the hottest girl in school,

212
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:05,721
and Greg is fugly.

213
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:08,279
So what he's fugly? All the
guys in our family are fugly.

214
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,202
That don't stop us from
getting the hot chicks.

215
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:13,250
Look at me and look at your mother.
I mean, it makes no sense.

216
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,923
Only in, like, a Hollywood
movie or something.

217
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,729
Every guy in
school likes her, Dad.

218
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,046
And you'll be the guy
who ends up with her.

219
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,884
You know why? You're gonna
follow my three-step program.

220
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,440
Number one,
make the girl smile.

221
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:25,801
Number two, tell her
she has a nice smile.

222
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:29,248
Number three, say she has to
go out with you that night.

223
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,287
Why that night?

224
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,721
'Cause it gives her less time to
think about how fugly you are.

225
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:33,961
'Cause you are fugly.

226
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:35,724
That's the stupidest
thing I ever heard.

227
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:39,087
And Keithie's right... I'm too
chicken to even talk to her.

228
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,169
Hey, you're a Feder. Feders
ain't afraid of women, buddy.

229
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,889
That's not
the way I'm raising you.

230
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,167
Oh, by the way, Dad, did you ask
Mom if I can play football?

231
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,571
No, I was scared.

232
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:49,085
I'm afraid she's
gonna yell at me

233
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,684
in that accent that
no one understands.

234
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:52,682
Come on, Becky, it's 8=00.

235
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:54,325
School starts at 8=15.

236
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,562
That means we
only have 25 minutes.

237
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,765
Daddy, you promise Mr. Gigglesworth
will be better by bedtime?

238
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,490
Will you stop worrying about him?
He'll be fine. I love you.

239
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,328
Have the best last day, okay?
Okay.

240
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,525
Bye, guys.
Bye. Daddy.

241
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,647
Love you.

242
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:11,807
And you read
the street signs, okay?

243
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,041
Don't let Bean.

244
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:16,163
My God,
riding their bikes to school.

245
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,846
Couldn't do that in L.A.
with the nuts out there.

246
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:21,730
Yeah, 'cause thank God there's
no crazy people out here.

247
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,844


248
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,480
How you doing, Nick?

249
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:33,042
My wife's leaving
me after three weeks.

250
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,486
Three weeks?
That's not bad for you.

251
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:37,004
What happened?

252
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,447
She found me eating
a banana with my butt.

253
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:42,369
Ah. And she didn't like that?

254
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,522
Yeah,
she got really bummed out,

255
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:47,688
but, you know, I shouldn't have
done it at her mom's house.

256
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:49,403
Yeah, you...

257
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:51,163
You seem like you're a little
extra out of it today.

258
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,365
What's going on?

259
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,765
Yeah, I'm a little medicated.

260
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,844
I met a very reliable doctor
at a Cypress Hill concert,

261
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:59,730
and he floated me a couple pills
just to feel better, you know.

262
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:00,801
 But I
don't feel better!

263
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:02,529
 You feel worse!

264
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:12,121
Ladies and gentlemen,
meet your new bus driver.

265
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:15,289
Finally got yourself a job.

266
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,647
Actually I'm filling in for
Drool-io Iglesias back there.

267
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:19,967


268
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:22,446


269
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,849
Hey,
Deanne, happy anniversary.

270
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:27,162
Oh! Thank you, Lenny.

271
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,085
Lenny remembered.
Isn't that sweet?

272
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:31,365
And I never got him pregnant.

273
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,725
She forgot?

274
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,000
Yeah, she forgot.

275
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,245
No.

276
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,606
I got the biggest get-out-of-jail-free
card in the world.

277
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:39,169
I want one of those.

278
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,764
Oh, you ain't never get one
like this. Hey, honey,

279
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,081
I'm gonna take
a ride to work with Lenny.

280
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:44,809
Don't worry about
forgetting the 20th.

281
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:46,524
I'm sure you'll
remember the 30th.

282
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,763
I love you.

283
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,571
Yeah, sure you do...
Deep down.

284
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:59,962
That's not another
necklace in there, is it?

285
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:02,485


286
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:06,605
I'm gonna abuse this
get-out-of-jail-free card,

287
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,085
I'm telling you right now.

288
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:11,369
I mean, maybe I'll walk on the good
rug without taking off my boots.

289
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,441
Oh!

290
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:15,370
Or have a nice
non-diet soda with my dinner.

291
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,163
Not just one, either,

292
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,400
a whole damn pitcher.

293
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,363
Oh, so you're going full gangsta.
Oh, yeah.

294
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,124
But you know what
I'd really like to do?

295
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,610
Throw a "first
night of summer" party.

296
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,085
Yeah. You know, something
a little crazy.

297
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,644
Well,
it's been many, many years

298
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:28,205
since we've done
something crazy.

299
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:29,644
Just one problem, though.

300
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,370
My house isn't big enough.

301
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,043
But yours is.


302
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,691
Last party I had was senior
year in high school.

303
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:37,682
Yeah, that was, like,
the best night of my life.

304
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:38,760
We all hooked up with chicks.

305
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:40,644
Come on,
why not do that again?

306
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,006
Because we already
have chicks and kids

307
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,407
and high
cholesterol now, so just...

308
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,528
It's time to move on. You want
to come over tonight with Dee,

309
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,840
that's fine... I think.

310
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:50,125
I got to ask my wife first.

311
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,123
Okay, gangsta.


312
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:57,000
Hey, hey, where'd you get
those shoes, Losers "R" Us?

313
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,126
I made them.

314
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,644
You made them?

315
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,245
In a toilet? {LAUGHS}

316
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,649
That kid's like
white Precious.

317
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,960


318
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:07,006
Get lost, Duffy.

319
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,445
Yeah, leave her alone.

320
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:10,522
Hey,
what'd you say, Hollywood?

321
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,806
You got
something to say to me?

322
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:13,159
Nothing, nothing, nothing.

323
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,403
<i>Attention, Kmart shoppers,
let's find a seat, please.</i>

324
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,845
<i>Yes,
you in the camouflage jacket</i>

325
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,563
<i>and Mariah Carey hairdo.</i>

326
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:22,041
<i>Yeah,
just pop a squat, thank you.</i>

327
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,488
You're lucky your dad's here,
but he won't be here all day.

328
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:26,561
Leave me alone.

329
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,687
<i>Beanbag with arms and legs,</i>

330
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:30,046
<i>seriously, take a seat,</i>

331
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,043
<i>or seats,
before someone gets hurt.</i>

332
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,201


333
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,123
You're dead, man.

334
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,563


335
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:47,722
ROXANNE= I'm gonna go get
some things done,

336
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:50,644
and then I'm gonna go to my
daughter's ballet recital,

337
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,721
so you're on your
own until lunchtime.

338
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:54,927
Oh, no worries.
No one will come in anyway.

339
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,841
Right.

340
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:02,407
Does Leonard
ever talk about me?

341
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,924
Leonard?

342
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,966
Your husband.

343
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:06,610
Oh, Lenny.

344
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:09,967
I probably should have told you
this before I started working here,

345
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:13,043
but he used to
be my boyfriend.

346
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,441
Oh.

347
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:18,761
When did you guys go out?

348
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,921
Sixth grade.

349
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:21,600
This one time,

350
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:25,525
we split a piece of bubble gum at recess.


351
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,604
I brought in a note

352
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:35,129
that he sent me, and I
thought you should see it.

353
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,043
I just felt weird
having a secret with you.

354
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:45,250
"Do you like my hair better
in a barrette or a headband?"

355
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,446
That's what I wrote.

356
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:48,249
"Barrette. "

357
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,209
And that was his response.

358
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,643
Does it bother you
that I still wear it?

359
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,280
Oh, no, no, no,
I think it's sweet.

360
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:04,841
I think he still
has feelings for me.

361
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,850
I'm gonna go work out now.

362
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:09,490
Do you really think
that a tight, toned body

363
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:11,801
will keep him away
from his Hubba Bubba baby?

364
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:14,962
I hope so. Bye.

365
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:17,447
<i>You just messed with
the wrong girl, chica!</i>

366
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,447
They spray-painted my baby.

367
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,169
Gee, and
everything's spelled right.

368
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,923
These can't be my students.


369
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,441
Oh!

370
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,720
Have a nice day, Rapunzel.

371
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:36,485
Hey,
guys, can you believe this?

372
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:38,369
Calendar turns to June,

373
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,885
my wonderful students,
they become animals.

374
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,563
Maybe they're just
mad that you keep going

375
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,129
to the babyGap to
buy your clothes.

376
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,168
BOY= Hey, Principal Tardio,
good morning.

377
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,969
Right to class,
right to class.

378
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,811
How was your last ride in
before the summer, Nick?

379
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,363
Remember,
today is only a half a day.

380
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,168
And a half a shirt, right?
What?

381
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,082
I said he wants to wave good-bye to you.
Oh, okay.

382
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:00,764
Here he goes.

383
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,524
I'm excited about the summer,
too.

384
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,682
Hey, that's my laptop!
That's not waterproof!

385
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:06,090
Monkey boy, monkey boy.

386
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,486
Summer!

387
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:08,527
Monkey boy.

388
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:09,601
Summer!

389
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,411
Summer! Summer!

390
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,608
So, what do you think?

391
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,289
Do I take you
straight to work?

392
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,646
I got one
appointment I got to get to

393
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:22,040
sometime between 8=00 a. m.
and 4=00 p. m.

394
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,201
Okay.
But she can wait.

395
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:25,442
Good. And look at this.

396
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:27,284
He's back at it again.

397
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,810
Why isn't he at work?

398
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,405
He's just...
This woman has a grip on him.

399
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:34,000
It's ridiculous.
It's gonna ruin his marriage.

400
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,769
Thank you for breakfast,
Mommy.

401
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:39,844
<i>Will you be coming by to watch
Days of Our Lives later?</i>

402
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,442
Well, we got to find out which
twin murdered Renaldo, right?

403
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:44,806
We sure do.

404
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,325
Mmm-hmm.


405
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,049
Okay.
LENNY= Hey, Mrs. Lamonsoff,

406
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:49,121
good to see you.

407
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,406
Nice school bus, Lenny.

408
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,163
Thank you. Have a great day.

409
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,048
Did Mommy make
the boo-boo go away?

410
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:56,848
Don't tell the wife.

411
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,046
What are you guys doing?

412
00:17:58,119 --> 00:17:59,848
Get in.

413
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,961
Oh, hey, Nick.

414
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,121
Nice. Nice.

415
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,565
Let's hit it.

416
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,482
Watch this.

417
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,083
BOTH= on!


418
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,207
Wow.

419
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:13,441
You got to respect that.

420
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:14,520
That was awesome.

421
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:18,847
What's Lenny's problem? They're
so cute when they're little.

422
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,127
I know. I miss it.

423
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,770
Ronnie, Ronnie, Ronnie.

424
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,287


425
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:28,044
You miss that? Really?

426
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,561
Stay. Stay.


427
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,925
Don't you growl at me.

428
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,080
Stay, baby, Stay-

429
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,286
Excuse me.

430
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:36,442
Is your kid gonna be in here
when the instructor comes in?

431
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:37,964
That's not my kid.

432
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:40,849
That's my lover,
and he's very gentle.

433
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,445


434
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:45,602
Kids don't belong in here.

435
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,364
That leash
better not trip me up.

436
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,924
Leash isn't gonna trip you up.

437
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,083
It's your big-ass, hairy man
feet that are gonna trip you up.

438
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,480


439
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:55,729
She was just
joking around, sir.

440
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,483
Cool it.
You're gonna get us killed.

441
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,086
DEANNE= I'm sorry.
I'm having the worst day.

442
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,406
Welcome to Squat Fitness,
ladies.

443
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,644
Apparently your new instructor's
running a bit late.

444
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,483
I'm sorry.
It's only five till...

445
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,403
Yeah, so he asked me to lead
you in some warm-up exercises.

446
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:14,648
So,
everybody, up on your feet,

447
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,290
and let's take a deep breath.

448
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:18,645
 Good.

449
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:20,967
Deeper... Really
stretch out those lungs.

450
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,201
And now let's shimmy.

451
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:23,644
Shake
the shoulders back and forth.

452
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,449
Shake them.

453
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:27,243
Very good, very good.

454
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:29,925
Yeah, oh, yeah.

455
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,445
Now let's do some
jackhammer squats.

456
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,007
Right, put your hands in front
of you like this. Just relax.

457
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:36,923
And then squat up
and down but fast.

458
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,569
Faster, faster, there you go.

459
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,641
Really fast.

460
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,324
Faster, faster.

461
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,242
Too fast.
Do it a little slower.

462
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:44,605
Now, everybody turn,

463
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,125
face the back of the room,
bend over,

464
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,690
and reach for your toes.

465
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:49,807
Why do we have to turn around?

466
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,040
If you please.

467
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:55,727
And bend over as
low as you can go.

468
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:59,447
Now take the right hand and slap
it against the right cheek.

469
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,365
Relax the wrist and slap
that right butt, slap it.

470
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:05,250
Good,
I want to hear that slap.

471
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:07,686
Oh, yes, this is wonderful.

472
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,041
Morning, ladies.

473
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:11,565
You started without me?

474
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,801
Yes,
just like you asked me to.

475
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,362
Say it's true
even if it isn't.

476
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,169

What?

477
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,005
Oh, you loved it!
You loved it!

478
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:23,320


479
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,883
Yeah, that's my boy.

480
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,040
All right.

481
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,326
JANITOR= You're
all prostitutes!

482
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,448
Anyway. I'm Kyle,

483
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:34,365
and welcome to the summer
session of Squatrobics 101.

484
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,249
I wish they called
it something else,

485
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:38,202
but that's what
they told me to say.

486
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:42,000
Okay,
so, before we start for real,

487
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:43,205
any questions?

488
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:44,566
Yes.

489
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,965
Are you married?


490
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:47,121
No.

491
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,361
Nope, I'm... I'm single.

492
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,169
Um...
Yeah.

493
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,564
 I forgot. You're so
gorgeous, my head is spinning.

494
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,925
I'm sorry. God.

495
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:58,046
Go ahead.

496
00:20:58,119 --> 00:21:02,204
I have a very important question,
and it's a two-parter.

497
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:03,923
The first part of
the question is,

498
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:05,690
"Did a scientist
make you in a lab?"

499
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:07,443
And the second part
of the question is,

500
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:09,840
"Can I stick my tongue down your
throat, please?" {WOMEN CHUCKLING}

501
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:13,605
All right, guys, look,
I'm flattered. Really, lam,

502
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:17,605
but most of you are married
and I happen to be gay.

503
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:19,285
{WOMEN GROAN
WITH DISAPPOINTMENT}

504
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:20,486
Of course he is.

505
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,210
All of 'em.
That sucks!

506
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:23,486
DEANNE= What a waste!

507
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:24,971
Stay out of my bag,
little man.

508
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:27,084
Why does she have this?

509
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,366
That's not a jock strap,
that's a G-string.

510
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,441


511
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,161


512
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,006
Well, well, well,

513
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:56,683
if it isn't Hollywood

514
00:21:56,759 --> 00:21:59,161
and the Squares.


515
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,480
Hey, Malcolm, I didn't
know you worked at Kmart,

516
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:04,325
and apparently the hair on top of
your head didn't know it, either.

517
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,560
What?

518
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,846
Do me a favour, go like this.

519
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,604
I think I got
something in my teeth.

520
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,006
What?
You know,

521
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:13,481
next time, you should use that
Chia Pet stuff on your whole head.

522
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:14,839
What?

523
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,886
Why is Higgins buying

524
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,371
O.J.'s knife right now?

525
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,480
You think you're tough?

526
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:19,601
KURT= Hey, Malcolm,

527
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,286
is that the knife the Indians
used to half-scalp you with?

528
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,605
I don't even get that.

529
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,965
What?

530
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,121
Oh, come on,
let's cheer him up

531
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,526
Benny Hill-style.
Here we go.

532
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:28,726
ERIC= Come on,
come on, come on, come on...

533
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:29,961
LENNY= Does that make
you feel better?

534
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:33,839
Yo, Crocodile Dumb-dee,
how'd it go with the kid?

535
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,683
Good, good. He's in school.

536
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:37,682
Kids in school for one day?

537
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:40,888
I didn't know what else to do.
He's a thug, Lenny.

538
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,530
He cut the head off a teddy bear.
Imagine what he'll do to me.

539
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:46,079
So you're gonna buy
this to cut his head off?

540
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,366
No, I just want him to think
I'll cut his head off

541
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,009
so then he won't
cut my head off.

542
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:53,049
You want to scare a relative
without causing permanent injury?

543
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,288
<i>May I Suggest this?</i>

544
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:57,361
Ahhh!

545
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:03,926
Sir?
Sir? Can you get off the bed?

546
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,729
It's wake-up time.

547
00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:10,407
Yeah, all right, Grandma, I'm up!
Stop yelling at me.

548
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,607
Now, why is... Being mean?

549
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:16,048
I like sleeping over.
It's just you always yell.

550
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:18,122
You don't have to yell at me.

551
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,009
I love you.

552
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:21,444
I don't understand.

553
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,164


554
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:26,249
<i>Clean-up, aisle nine.</i>

555
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:28,766
Get out of me!

556
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:31,730
<i>And bring a shovel.</i>

557
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,366
So, my son Bumpty told me

558
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,090
he's gonna ask your daughter
out on a date at school today.

559
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,970
First of all, my daughter's never
been out on a date before,

560
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,930
and I'm sure she's not gonna start
off with some kid named Bumpty.

561
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,970
He is the only other
black kid in her grade.

562
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,848
Wait, you want her
to date a white guy?

563
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,444
Yeah, Farrakhan.

564
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:52,602
I'd rather she date the whitest
white guy in the world

565
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,761
than your little
bald-headed boy.

566
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:57,930
All right, but, you know,
don't worry when she says yes,

567
00:23:58,039 --> 00:23:59,690
'cause I already
had the talk with him.

568
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:01,523
What talk?
Dating.

569
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:04,410
I told him how we used to roll
with the ladies in high school.

570
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,882
You know, beep-beep.


571
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:10,490


572
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,800
What?

573
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,326
I should get some
pepper spray for my kid.

574
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,846
Some moron on the bus
keeps messing with him,

575
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,729
and he refuses to fight back.

576
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:22,166
You know, that reminds me
of someone I know.

577
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,684
Who?
You.

578
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:25,682
What are you talking about?
I got in plenty of fights.

579
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:27,523
Remember ninth grade
when Tommy Cavanaugh

580
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:29,045
moved here from Texas?

581
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:32,602
He nonstop abused you,
and you did nothing about it.

582
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,522
Tommy Cavanaugh
was a 'roid freak.

583
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:36,602
He had back zits
on his back zits.

584
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,284
Plus, he was
joking around with me.

585
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:41,329
If it was real, I swear to God,
I would've knocked him out.

586
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,605
Hey, isn't that
Cavanaugh right there?

587
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,523
Where?


588
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:46,646
Gotcha.

589
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,847
That was really funny,
man, really funny.

590
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,683
Hey, you weren't
exactly Captain Courageous

591
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:52,648
when we were
growing up, now, were you?

592
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:54,603
Hey, I never backed
out of a fight, though.

593
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,165
Yeah, but did you ever jump
off Suicide 35 at the quarry?

594
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,765
Oh, that's right.

595
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:00,922
He always came up with a
lame excuse not to do it.

596
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,525
What are you talking about?
"Oh, I can't.

597
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:04,840
"I'm on my period.
It'll attract sharks. "

598
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,967


599
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:10,010
Suicide 35 off the top rock.
35 feet above the water.

600
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:13,323
My mom did that jump when she was
pregnant with me. {LAUGHING}

601
00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:24,523
There's a raft in there?

602
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:27,121
Whoa!

603
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,605
Who did that?

604
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,727


605
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,763
All right, little birds.
Find your nests, man.

606
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,645
Float down.
There we go, and we're in.

607
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,800
All right, guys,

608
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:47,201
normally we don't have exciting
news this late into the term,

609
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,647
but we have a new student joining
us today, Braden Higgins.

610
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,960
Hey, there's an empty
seat over there, man.

611
00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:54,326
Why don't you go cop a squat?

612
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:00,567
Or go that way, man.

613
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,642
Take your own path.

614
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,923
No.

615
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,411
I sit here.

616
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,561
Is your dad Marcus Higgins?

617
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,250
Yeah, I've known him since I was a baby.
He's the funniest.

618
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:24,448
The best. Great, great man.

619
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,490
I want to smash his face.

620
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:29,560
Yeah, me, too.

621
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,606
Yeah, I hate that guy.

622
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,568
Screw him.

623
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,766
Yo, Charlotte,
hold up, hold up. Question...

624
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:41,923
How would you like to spend
the first night of summer

625
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,765
with a hardcore up-and-comer?

626
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:47,046
What does that mean?

627
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:48,609
I think he's asking you out.

628
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,727
He is?

629
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:51,369
You are?

630
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,964
I don't make stuff up.

631
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,406
Well, can Donna come?

632
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,403
Three's a crowd, McCloud.

633
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,561
No, he didn't.
Yes, he did.

634
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:03,365
It's okay, Charlotte.
It's a date, your first date.

635
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,566
Just you two.

636
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,130
All right. I mean,

637
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,929
I'd have to ask my parents,

638
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,526
but I think
that would be okay.

639
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:13,601
COACH= Hey, Bumpty.

640
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,125
You think just because
it's the last day of school,

641
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,282
you can sit and
socialize the entire period?

642
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:22,442
I don't think about stuff
like that, Lady Shorts.

643
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:23,726
Well, can you think fast?

644
00:27:24,039 --> 00:27:25,086
Ow!

645
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,320


646
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,006
Who wants to
watch me climb a rope?

647
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:32,402
 Yeah!

648
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:33,601
Ugh.

649
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:35,080
Oh, you're the man!

650
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:36,320
Whoo!

651
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,121
Yo, he's got to put those
Easter eggs back in the basket.

652
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,724
Dang!

653
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:43,847
Kelly,
I don't want to hear it!

654
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:45,769
Oh, I can't take it anymore!

655
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:48,001
I wish I never had you!

656
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:49,763
Oh! Stop it! Stop it!

657
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:51,807
See, that's why I
don't want four kids.

658
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,243
Yeah, people with four just
lose their minds. Yeah.

659
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:55,599
They're yelling,
they're screaming.

660
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,761
Sometimes they go to jail
just to get some sleep.

661
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:00,286
Hold up. Hang on.

662
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:01,599
I got a burpsnart coming.
Uh-oh.

663
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,244


664
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:05,366
MARCUS= Ho ho!

665
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,601
Come on.

666
00:28:06,759 --> 00:28:07,885
You got to teach
me how you do that.

667
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,450
A burpsnart? It's simple.
Yeah.

668
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:11,170
You just start with a burp,

669
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,048
then you sniff for a sneeze,
you get that going,

670
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:14,326
and that
triggers a fart, always.

671
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,641
What's up with
this school bus?

672
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,644
Okay. I stole it.

673
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:21,967
What?
Put your hands in the air.

674
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,248
<i>śśAnd wave them like you
just don't care "ho"</i>

675
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:28,366
<i>ALL= śśOh!</i>

676
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,441
<i>śśSay "ho"</i>

677
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,047
<i>ALL; śśOh! śś</i>

678
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:33,167
I heard you're having
a party tonight, Lenny.

679
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,322
What? I'm not
having a party.

680
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,487
Where did you hear that?

681
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:39,086
He's a cop.
He hears everything.

682
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,161
LENNY= Oh, God.

683
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:41,963
Look, it's Magnum P.U.

684
00:28:42,039 --> 00:28:44,087
Look at him getting all serious.
I still can't believe

685
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,044
you're a cop after all the
sick stuff you did growing up.

686
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,730
The Peter Dante who stole
your parents' snowmobile

687
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:52,644
and sold it to purchase
crack cocaine is dead, Feder.

688
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,403
This side of
the law is way better.

689
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,006
To serve and protect.
Got to love it.

690
00:28:57,079 --> 00:28:59,320
Hey, McKenzie, I heard you
assaulted somebody in there.

691
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,563
I didn't assault anybody.
I just choked out your brother.

692
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,803
Yeah, he deserves it.
He's crazy.

693
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,690
We got five minutes
to get to that stupid recital.

694
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:10,842
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Recital?

695
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,000
At McDonough Elementary?

696
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:13,166
Yes.

697
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,240
Can I come?

698
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:15,320
Why?

699
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,602
Trust me.
Everybody's got to go.

700
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,409
We got five minutes. We're
never gonna make it there.

701
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,605
You'll get there on time,

702
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,968
'cause we're gonna give you a
four-alarm presidential police escort.

703
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:25,279
Isn't that against the law?

704
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:26,805
I am the law!

705
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,404



706
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,481
What's happening?

707
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,607
 Whoo!

708
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,401


709
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:38,365


710
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:44,800


711
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,688
Oh, my God!
What just happened?

712
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:51,121


713
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:58,280
Welcome, parents, to final
performance of school year,

714
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,401
our June-a-licious

715
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,767
Dance Spectacular!

716
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,085
Now, for this year,

717
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,929
we go throwing a few

718
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,444
hip-hop moves in there.

719
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:13,521
Like this.

720
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,490
Is fun to dance.

721
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,039
Let the show begin.

722
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:33,126
So nice of you to invite your
friends and the bus driver

723
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,124
and the police force to our
daughter's dance recital.

724
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:40,568
Yeah, huge ballet fans,
all of them.

725
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,641


726
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,441


727
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,401
SALLY= Ooh!
ERIC= Oh.

728
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,049
She's so cute.

729
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:06,609
So cute.
She's adorable, isn't she?

730
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,965
She is adorable.

731
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:09,609
Fantastic stuff.
Unbelievable.

732
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,289
Look at her go.
I am.

733
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:13,282
I'm looking at her.

734
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:28,525
I want to arrest her
for disturbing the peace.

735
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:30,602
In my pants.

736
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:42,089
I'm having a wonderful time.

737
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,480


738
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,647
She's got a solo?

739
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,921


740
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:54,599
What?

741
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:06,041
ROXANNE= It's fine.
I just wish that you

742
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,127
would give me more
than eight hours notice

743
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,327
before you tell me that
we're throwing a party, babe.

744
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,765
It's not a party.
Get out of here.

745
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:13,285
It's a couple people coming by.
Come on.

746
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:14,724
How'd you like it?

747
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,528
You were great, honey.
Hey!

748
00:32:16,599 --> 00:32:18,522
Where did you learn
to dance like that?

749
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:20,522
She moves like "Yagger," no?

750
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:22,364
Yes,
she does, she moves like...

751
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,930
Mick Yagger?
Is that what you were saying?

752
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,240
Hey, butter buns,
you ready to grab some eats?

753
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:28,242
Yes.

754
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:29,923
Cavanaugh.

755
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,320
Lenny Feder, I'll be damned.

756
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,643
Honey,
this is Tommy Cavanaugh.

757
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,528
He was my old steroid
that I grew up with.

758
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,641
This is my...

759
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,768
Wife, Roxanne.

760
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:42,490
Why are your
hands shaking, Daddy?

761
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:43,766
My hands are shaking?

762
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:45,490
Probably because I

763
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:47,800
had too much coffee
this morning, sweetheart.

764
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,086
I heard you
been running around

765
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,440
saying you could
take me in a fight.

766
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:52,682

You... I wouldn't say that.

767
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:54,568
Yeah, you did,
this morning in Kmart.

768
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,324
Kmart? Was I there?

769
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,366
I don't think I was there.

770
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,441
You know,

771
00:32:58,519 --> 00:32:59,806
all I can
remember about this guy

772
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,722
is smacking him around
whenever I wanted to,

773
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:03,722
and him not doing
a single thing about it.

774
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:07,167
Yeah, we had a lot of good
times like that growing up.

775
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:10,084
Why is your voice so shaky, Daddy?
Are you crying?

776
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,208
You don't stop talking,
do you?

777
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:14,123
Honey,
we should be getting going.

778
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,326
Sure, baby.

779
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,481
I want you to stop making up
lies about kicking my ass

780
00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:18,971
or I'm gonna have
to set you straight.

781
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:20,279
Sure, sure, sure.

782
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:22,124
I'll see you around.

783
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,009
Becky,
you be having great summer.

784
00:33:26,599 --> 00:33:28,489
I was one inch away

785
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,846
from knocking that guy out,
and I swear to God.

786
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,921
No, you weren't.

787
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,569
This is grown-up talk,

788
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,085
so butt out!

789
00:33:35,799 --> 00:33:36,800


790
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,404
That's insane!
What did you say to him?

791
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,164
I said, "Hey, Cavanaugh, you
speak to me like that again

792
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,210
"in front of my wife and kid, I will
brush your teeth with a brick. "

793
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:47,407
No, you didn't.
You just yelled at me.

794
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,403
I don't yell at you!
Calm down.

795
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,685
No, I'm just saying.

796
00:33:50,759 --> 00:33:52,125
You guys were in the bathroom.

797
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:54,281
Look who's here, everybody.

798
00:33:54,359 --> 00:33:57,250
20 VOSS waters, right?

799
00:33:57,319 --> 00:33:59,209
That's how they do it in Hollyweird.
I don't know.

800
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:02,602
We haven't lived there in, what,
10 months now or something?

801
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,122
As a matter of fact, our son
starts work here tonight.

802
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,726
I know. I heard you
brown-nosed Mr. Pappas

803
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,121
and now Showbiz
Junior's got a job.

804
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,726
I used to scoop cones here,
and why shouldn't he?

805
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,643
It's a great
first job for a kid.

806
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:19,367
Or lifetime job.

807
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:21,248
Okay, what are we having?

808
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,481
Becky, what do you want, hon.?

809
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:25,041
Can I have the soft
chocolate cup, please?

810
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:27,851
Here's a word you
probably never heard, no.

811
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,291
The machine's busted,
princess.

812
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:32,603
Aw, bummer, it's broken?
Like all your dreams?

813
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:35,641
You know what, it's easy to fix.
I can help you with that.

814
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,081
What do you know about fixing
ice cream machines, Higgins?

815
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,367
Uh, I went to
DeVry for a year.

816
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,487
Oh, that's right.

817
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:42,726
I can fix
anything with a plug.

818
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,925
Including your hair?

819
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,400
That's not true. I don't even
know how that got started.

820
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:48,090
That's, like, people are
saying that around town.

821
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:49,286
I'll walk you through it.

822
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,601
You just walk up, climb up the
machine, lean over the back.

823
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,329
Can't believe I'm
listening to this idiot.

824
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,400
Listen to the man.

825
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,606
MARCUS= You're gonna see

826
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:56,726
two pipes coming into the top.

827
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,449
Yes!
In between them,

828
00:34:58,519 --> 00:34:59,931
there's gonna be
a silver button.

829
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,001
Hit it a little bit.

830
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:02,126
Push hard.

831
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:04,009
No. Hit it with your fist.

832
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:05,769
Yeah, just push the button.

833
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,443
I got it.
There we go! {LAUGHING}

834
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:09,010
I think we're
getting somewhere.

835
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,121
Okay, keep going. Yeah, that...


836
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:12,280
Force it. That's it.

837
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,606
Hey! Why is Dickie crapping
all over the ice cream stand?

838
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:18,646
What'd she say?

839
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,806
Nothing! Nothing!

840
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,967
Go! Just go!

841
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,809


842
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,961
SALLY= Go, Dickie!

843
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:27,963
That's where ice
cream comes from?

844
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:34,400
And so we've reached the end
of another school year.

845
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:37,800
Froot Loop?

846
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,880
Ten months

847
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,929
<i>of learning, growth</i>

848
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,728
<i>and, yes, hopefully,</i>

849
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,961
<i>a little bit of fun.</i>

850
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:50,403
<i>But the journey we began
together, in September,</i>

851
00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:53,005
<i>does not end today.</i>

852
00:35:53,079 --> 00:35:56,050
<i>For education is a process</i>

853
00:35:56,119 --> 00:36:00,603
<i>that does not begin and end
on some set schedule...</i>

854
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:05,050
Please let me finish.
Return to your seats.

855
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:07,168


856
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:08,320
Damn you!

857
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,889
Every year, you do this to me!

858
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:13,601
<i>And this was my favourite shirt
from when I was 12!</i>

859
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:15,409
How you doing, sophomore?

860
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,891
Not bad, sophomore.

861
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,960
Come here!

862
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,521
Hey, you're
not a statue.

863
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:30,045
You're an ass-tue.


864
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:31,849
Doesn't even make any sense.

865
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,166
Shut up!

866
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,208
What? What? What?

867
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,045
Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!

868
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,690
What's up, man?

869
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,840
Your dad picking you up?

870
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:49,561
Uh, I don't know.

871
00:36:49,639 --> 00:36:51,880
I told him it'd be cool if he
stayed late at the soup kitchen,

872
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,724
so it's on me.

873
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,326
Well, you can come on the bus
with us, if you want.

874
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,407
Nah, how about we
do something fun?

875
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:02,369
How about we do something
we're not supposed to?

876
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,771
"Keep out. "

877
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,320
That just makes me
want to not keep out.

878
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:11,570
Heard our dads used to come
swimming here, back in the day.

879
00:37:11,639 --> 00:37:15,690
They claim to be all squeaky
clean, but I think they were nuts.

880
00:37:18,519 --> 00:37:19,521


881
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,764


882
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,925
College kids.

883
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,684
We better go.

884
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:33,402
No go.

885
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:34,851
Stay.

886
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,840
Whoo!

887
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:47,088
He's nuts.

888
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:48,280
Let's go.

889
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,440
Hey!

890
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:50,965
Where are you guys going?

891
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:53,889
Join the party.

892
00:37:54,519 --> 00:37:56,362
Here. One and two.

893
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,003
Are you guys freshmen?

894
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:01,809
No. We're seniors.

895
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,451
We just became seniors,
like, 20 minutes ago.

896
00:38:04,519 --> 00:38:06,681
Not high school seniors,
college seniors.

897
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,329
 Wait a minute!

898
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,128
I remember you guys.

899
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:11,963
You're Scully.

900
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:14,007
You're Boomer.

901
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:16,244
Come here.

902
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,764
I love you guys so much.

903
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,045
I love you, too.

904
00:38:19,159 --> 00:38:20,365
Girl, I love you more.

905
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,965
I'm gonna go.

906
00:38:22,039 --> 00:38:24,041
Whoo! Body shots!

907
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,083
No go.

908
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:27,126
Stay.

909
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:29,641
Okay, okay. But what
about these beers, man?

910
00:38:29,719 --> 00:38:31,324
If we don't drink them,
they'll be onto us,

911
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,965
and I'm not sure I'm
ready for beer yet.

912
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:36,003
Wait, let's just dump them
when no one's looking,

913
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,240
then act like we're drunk.

914
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,731
Okay. Good idea.

915
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,483
All right, let's go.

916
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:44,960


917
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:47,849
Summertime.

918
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,844
You're sure you want to do this, big man?
No shame in backing down.

919
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,887
Really?
Come on!

920
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,007
Come on.

921
00:38:53,079 --> 00:38:54,764
It's a lifelong shame.

922
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,320
You're finally doing
Suicide 35. It's a big day.

923
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,525
What are you scared of, man?

924
00:38:58,599 --> 00:39:01,523
You're the "rope from the tree,
triple flip, bird-crush" guy.

925
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:03,920
I'm not scared of this.
In the past, I did it before.

926
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,081
But I'll do it right now.

927
00:39:05,159 --> 00:39:06,161
Sure. Sure. Go ahead.

928
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,327
MARCUS= Do it. Do it.
ERIC= Whoa.

929
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,728
But the thing is this,
I just...

930
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,369
late about 45 minutes ago.

931
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,679
What did you eat?

932
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,045
I had chicken chow mein.

933
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:17,929
Chicken chow mein? When did...

934
00:39:18,039 --> 00:39:19,451
We were with you
the whole time!

935
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:21,284
Yeah. You didn't see it?
They had it at Kmart.

936
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,690
They have chicken chow...
Oh, get out of here.

937
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,045
It's good there. Yeah.
It's very good.

938
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:25,405
What do I hear right now?

939
00:39:26,679 --> 00:39:27,885
Look at this.

940
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:31,806
Beers on ice.
Hot ladies everywhere.

941
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,007
This is how we used to do it.

942
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:35,365
This is howl
still do it, buddy.

943
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,766
He does still do it that way.

944
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,170
Well, you should stop.

945
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,248
This is Kappa
Eta Sigma property.

946
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,400


947
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,969
So you might want to quit
perving on our ladies

948
00:39:44,039 --> 00:39:46,041
and get back to your trailer homes.


949
00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:48,407
Okay, easy there, Abercrombie.

950
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,005
I think it's...

951
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:51,969
I think we've been around
a little longer than you.

952
00:39:52,039 --> 00:39:53,643
Been swimming here
since we were eight years old,

953
00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:55,483
so you can calm
down a little bit.

954
00:39:55,639 --> 00:39:57,289
I'm sure it was the bomb!

955
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,443
Cranking your Al Jolson tunes
on your transistor radio.

956
00:40:00,519 --> 00:40:02,568
But it's the 21st century now.

957
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:04,563
And Thicky-Thick
and the Flabby Bunch

958
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:06,608
should never take
their shirts off again.

959
00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:07,681
That hurts.

960
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,766
Okay,
I guess I'm Thicky-Thick.

961
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,887
Yeah, well, I don't like being
in the Flabby Bunch, either.

962
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,565
Boom! That just happened.

963
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:16,445
I haven't been around this many
arrogant white college kids

964
00:40:16,519 --> 00:40:18,045
since Eminem played Duke.

965
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:19,565
There it goes. And then...

966
00:40:19,639 --> 00:40:20,800
Boom!

967
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,449
That just happened.
How was that?

968
00:40:22,519 --> 00:40:25,251
At least we got into college,
skinny Danny Glover.

969
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,360


970
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,324


971
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,889
Long hand job.
That's Rock, Paper, Scissors.

972
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:38,644
I think it's over.

973
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:40,289
Hey, hey, hey!
What, what, what?

974
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,565
What?

975
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,324
And a little
extra right there.

976
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,889
Hey, fellows,
that was a good handshake.

977
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,445
We got a good one, too.
It goes like this.

978
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:49,123
Okay, here we go.
Oh, how you doing, sir?

979
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:51,009
Nice to see you.
Very good, sir.

980
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:52,525
Beautiful day.
Yeah, at least we're not stuck

981
00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:56,161
in some crap town like this, hanging
up drywall for the rest of our lives.

982
00:40:56,239 --> 00:40:57,844
Bay-com!

983
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,251
Hanging drywall?
First of all,

984
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,731
I'll have you know
that I own pretty much

985
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,802
the greatest auto body shop
in town, all right?

986
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,722
This guy works for
the cable company.

987
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,005
Free cable for life.

988
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:07,206
What?

989
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,690
Over here,
you know Higgins?

990
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,161
That's right, he works part-time
down at the go-kart track.

991
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,601
Oh, so he was highballing
you with the drywall.

992
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,849
BOTH= Boom!

993
00:41:17,159 --> 00:41:18,365


994
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,010
This just got real.

995
00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:21,201
Real stupid? What happened?

996
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,400
Something's real.

997
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:30,048


998
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:31,166
Yeah...

999
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,327
Dougie, Dougie...

1000
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,846
Are you guys as wasted as us?

1001
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,809
BOTH= Hells, yeah!
All the time!

1002
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:43,286
Yo, we're gonna let you guys continue
your Klan meeting in a minute.

1003
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,840
He's just gonna jump off of
here, and then we'll leave.

1004
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,364
I can't permit that.

1005
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,123
I can't permit it!

1006
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:53,088
Can't permit it.

1007
00:41:53,159 --> 00:41:56,083
You guys have ruined
our celebration by being here.

1008
00:41:56,199 --> 00:41:58,521
Look at my hands, huh?

1009
00:41:58,599 --> 00:41:59,965
They're shaking, I'm so mad.

1010
00:42:00,039 --> 00:42:01,643
Yeah,
look, my brother's shaking.

1011
00:42:03,079 --> 00:42:05,367
LENNY= Wha... Wha...
Whoa, whoa.

1012
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,282
That was a cool move.
Now, listen to me.

1013
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,202
I'm gonna kick this kid's ass.

1014
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,646
But I need, like, 11 to 15
minutes to stretch out, okay?

1015
00:42:11,719 --> 00:42:12,880
I got to stretch.
It's overlooked.

1016
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,485
No, I understand.

1017
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:16,210
I can't fight these kids.
I'm skinny Danny Glover.

1018
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,123
Guys,
this guy's doing 11 flips

1019
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,123
behind you for
some unknown reason.

1020
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:24,963
We got kids,
we can't afford to do this.

1021
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:26,724
Buddy, dude, you don't have
to do that last flip.

1022
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,927
Don't, like, get hurt.

1023
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,206
We'll come back another time.

1024
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,565
You will come back never!

1025
00:42:31,639 --> 00:42:33,722
This is Kappa Eta Sigma property!


1026
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,086
Dude,
why are you acting so crazy?

1027
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:39,050
Did Betty White
just call you crazy?

1028
00:42:39,159 --> 00:42:40,286
Did he just call you Betty White?
Betty White?

1029
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,360
That's pretty funny.

1030
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,804
We've got a situation!

1031
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,166


1032
00:42:54,159 --> 00:42:55,525
You know what?
Hey, guys? Guys?

1033
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:57,250
LENNY= Hey, what's up, guys?
ERIC= Let's get out of here.

1034
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,445
MARCUS= Listen,
it's nice to meet everybody.

1035
00:42:58,519 --> 00:42:59,567
We're gonna take off,
but let's do this again.

1036
00:42:59,719 --> 00:43:00,766
Take care, guys.

1037
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,170
Enjoy yourself.
Not that way.

1038
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:04,561
Oh, is there an elevator?

1039
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:07,969
That way.

1040
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:12,530
Oh, come on, are you serious?
You gonna make us jump?

1041
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,001
Naked.

1042
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,922
Asshole.

1043
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,001


1044
00:43:21,719 --> 00:43:22,721
CROWD= Oh!

1045
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,400


1046
00:43:25,159 --> 00:43:27,811
You guys are losers.


1047
00:43:31,159 --> 00:43:32,400
CROWD= Oh!

1048
00:43:34,519 --> 00:43:35,521


1049
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:38,206
Don't worry, it gets bigger.

1050
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,481
Ahh!

1051
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:40,880
Whoa!

1052
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:43,126
CROWD= Oh!

1053
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:45,168
That poor old lady!

1054
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,367
Ahh! Ah ha ha!

1055
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,929
Rm Paralyzed!

1056
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,286
I'm in so much pain!

1057
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,248
Mama!

1058
00:43:56,199 --> 00:43:58,327
No!

1059
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,400
CROWD= Oh!

1060
00:44:01,199 --> 00:44:02,201


1061
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:06,248
I was inside you!

1062
00:44:12,639 --> 00:44:16,565
I can't believe nobody's even
scared of a black guy anymore!

1063
00:44:16,639 --> 00:44:18,768
Damn you, Obama!

1064
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:21,889
What the hell just happened?

1065
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,565
I saw my dad's dick.

1066
00:44:26,599 --> 00:44:27,601


1067
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,731
Well, the good news is Lamonsoff
finally did the jump for real.

1068
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:48,007
And the bad news is
he landed on my face.

1069
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:50,168
What are you,
made of rocks, dude?

1070
00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:52,686
Check this out, feel this.
I'm not kidding you.

1071
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:54,045
Right up here.

1072
00:44:54,119 --> 00:44:55,086
I think even higher.

1073
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:56,161
Feel that.
And?

1074
00:44:56,239 --> 00:44:57,400
Put your hand right there.

1075
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,208
Feel the other one.
Those are my balls.

1076
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,123
I'm not kidding you,
they went way up in there.

1077
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:02,360
You're getting me turned on.

1078
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,521
Are you kidding me?

1079
00:45:04,599 --> 00:45:05,646
What?

1080
00:45:05,719 --> 00:45:07,050
They slashed our tires!

1081
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:08,530
These kids won't
stop abusing us!

1082
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:09,766
LENNY= Damn you!

1083
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:12,963
This wasn't college kids.

1084
00:45:13,039 --> 00:45:15,646
It was my son, Satan.

1085
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,128
And why is this kid so angry?

1086
00:45:18,199 --> 00:45:21,170
His mom hiccupped a lot, but
she was happy! And hot.

1087
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,402
If she's so hot,

1088
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:26,164
why don't you make her
your late-night booty call?

1089
00:45:26,239 --> 00:45:28,766
Oh, Beefcakes!
Come on, baby!

1090
00:45:29,239 --> 00:45:31,128


1091
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:34,804
You've been sneaking around with Fabio?


1092
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,326
It's not funny, dude! She's gonna
kick the crap out of me later!

1093
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:38,525
ERIC= Wow.

1094
00:45:38,599 --> 00:45:40,090
Wow.

1095
00:45:40,159 --> 00:45:41,286
A little
five-hour Energy, huh?

1096
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:42,481
Yeah.

1097
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:45,889
500-hour Energy?

1098
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,405
I drink it for the taste,
okay?

1099
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:50,563
Oh, my God, you gonna jog
to Florida after this?

1100
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,684


1101
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,280
BOTH= Oh!

1102
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:55,360
No!

1103
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:56,686
A bonus!

1104
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,523
Come on,
just cram yourself in there.

1105
00:45:58,599 --> 00:46:01,603
My body, it's just too big for this thing.
I can't fit.

1106
00:46:01,679 --> 00:46:03,920
Higgins, dummy, hop in
this thing for a minute.

1107
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,081
For what?

1108
00:46:05,239 --> 00:46:06,286
Just get in the tire.

1109
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:08,282
No way! In there?
Five yards we'll roll you.

1110
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,726
We've done it. I would do
it if I could get in there.

1111
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,449
This is peer pressure,
you're bullying.

1112
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:15,090
And I promise you
I'll stop you and I love you.

1113
00:46:15,159 --> 00:46:17,242
Don't let him do it.
He's jacked up on juice.

1114
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:19,367
And a-one, and a-two...

1115
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,440
Mommy's got you.

1116
00:46:20,519 --> 00:46:21,521
...and a-three!

1117
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:22,681


1118
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,289
MARCUS= Okay, five feet.
Grab me. Y'ello.

1119
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:25,963
Lenny!
Hey, Keithie.

1120
00:46:26,039 --> 00:46:28,246
Meet me at the football field,
but don't tell your mother.

1121
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:29,969
Why am I still rolling?

1122
00:46:30,039 --> 00:46:31,643
Lenny!
Oops.

1123
00:46:31,719 --> 00:46:33,369
MARCUS= Help!

1124
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,090
Guys. get me!

1125
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:36,240
LENNY= Hang in there!

1126
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,485
MARCUS= I'm going downhill!

1127
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:38,641
Lenny! No! No!

1128
00:46:38,719 --> 00:46:40,244


1129
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,971
When will it end?

1130
00:46:44,519 --> 00:46:46,329


1131
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:47,447


1132
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:50,284
Oh, yeah.
Summer is here, man!

1133
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:53,090


1134
00:46:56,039 --> 00:46:59,202
MARCUS= Help! Stop! No!

1135
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:01,081


1136
00:47:01,159 --> 00:47:02,161
Tire on the loose!

1137
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:03,730
Fluzoo, shotgun, now!

1138
00:47:04,719 --> 00:47:05,766


1139
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:07,840
MARCUS= Someone!

1140
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,570
Higgins is in the tire!

1141
00:47:09,679 --> 00:47:11,010
Of course.

1142
00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:12,684
Help!
LENNY= Get there!

1143
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:14,250
Help!

1144
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:15,320
Liar!

1145
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:16,400
No,no,baby!

1146
00:47:17,559 --> 00:47:20,847
No! No! Someone!

1147
00:47:21,079 --> 00:47:22,445


1148
00:47:25,039 --> 00:47:26,041
Ahh! Ahh!

1149
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,001


1150
00:47:31,079 --> 00:47:33,161
Shaw's over, tire.

1151
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:34,960
MARCUS= OW!

1152
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,210


1153
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,327
I'm next.

1154
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,050
I got next!
No, I'm next!

1155
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:50,963


1156
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,159
It's my tire! My turn!

1157
00:47:53,239 --> 00:47:55,003
Hey!

1158
00:47:55,079 --> 00:47:56,809
What happened?

1159
00:47:57,239 --> 00:47:58,525
I got a phone call.

1160
00:47:58,719 --> 00:47:59,721
Oh.

1161
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,530
Okay. I forgive you.

1162
00:48:02,599 --> 00:48:04,806
Was it
long-distance or something?

1163
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,847
Don't want to kick a guy
while he's down, Higgins,

1164
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:09,126
but we caught your son
with a can of spray paint

1165
00:48:09,239 --> 00:48:11,208
looking like he
was up to no good.

1166
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,885
You lied about the soup.

1167
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:16,405
You lied about the soup!

1168
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:35,369
We are gonna find
those fartheads,

1169
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:38,126
and we are gonna kill them.

1170
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:39,929
Kill!

1171
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,641
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

1172
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:50,563
No, guys! Not each other!

1173
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:53,449
We're not killing each other!

1174
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:56,570
K- E-I-T

1175
00:48:56,639 --> 00:48:59,449
H- I-E.

1176
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:01,681
Keithie, Keithie, Keithie!
Whoo! Uh-huh!

1177
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:05,128
It's a practice, Donna. You
don't have to go full speed.

1178
00:49:05,199 --> 00:49:06,440
Sorry, Mr. Feder.

1179
00:49:06,519 --> 00:49:07,646
It's fine!

1180
00:49:07,719 --> 00:49:10,199
Hey, look at these
giant mooses out there.

1181
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:11,963


1182
00:49:13,719 --> 00:49:15,802
You don't want to get
in the middle of all that.

1183
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:17,643
Plus, the kicker,
honestly, is like,

1184
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,443
one of the most
important guys on the team

1185
00:49:19,559 --> 00:49:20,971
and you don't have
to worry about getting

1186
00:49:21,079 --> 00:49:22,490
your head bashed
in every play.

1187
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:24,483
 I get it, Dad.
I'm a wimp.

1188
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:25,641
You're not a wimp.

1189
00:49:25,719 --> 00:49:26,925
It's just common sense.

1190
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,842
Avoid big idiots
trying to hurt you.

1191
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,804
I was trying to
avoid a big idiot

1192
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:32,331
trying to hurt me on
the bus this morning,

1193
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,731
but he wouldn't
leave me alone.

1194
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,722
Well, sometimes they
won't let you avoid them,

1195
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,326
and you just... You can't back
down in those situations.

1196
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,367
I'm telling you,
I've backed down a few times,

1197
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:41,565
it's not a good feeling.

1198
00:49:41,639 --> 00:49:43,528
All right, look, let's just
kick a few field goals.

1199
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:45,284
It's like soccer,
which you're great at.

1200
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:48,204
All you got to do is put your
foot right through the ball.

1201
00:49:51,039 --> 00:49:52,371
Whoo!
What?

1202
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:53,646
Touchdown! Yeah!

1203
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,364
Yeah!

1204
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,521
That's ridiculous!
Your first try?

1205
00:49:57,639 --> 00:49:59,608
All right,
we're backing up, boy.

1206
00:49:59,679 --> 00:50:02,251
That was totally awesome, Keithie!
That was so cool!

1207
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:04,606
That was just, like, awesome!

1208
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:06,568
Okay, drive through the ball.

1209
00:50:06,639 --> 00:50:08,210
Drive through the ball.

1210
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:11,327
It's up!

1211
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,365
Whoo! Yeah!
Whoo! Go, Keithie!

1212
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:17,409
LENNY= Yes! What did you
eat this morning?

1213
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:21,121
All right, this is starting to
get into, like, college level.

1214
00:50:21,199 --> 00:50:22,644
From the 30!

1215
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:24,403
Who the hell is this kid?

1216
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,286


1217
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:31,885
Oh, my God!

1218
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:33,530
<i>śśStop! Keithie time!</i>

1219
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,728
<i>śśOh! Oh! Oh! Oh! śś</i>

1220
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:39,043
I'm starting to think
she has a little crush on you.

1221
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:40,201
Really?

1222
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:42,851
Either that or she got bit
by a poisonous spider.

1223
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:45,001
Keithie! Whoo!

1224
00:50:46,199 --> 00:50:47,644
All right,
let's see how you do

1225
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,164
in a real game situation,
though.

1226
00:50:49,239 --> 00:50:51,686
Okay? Let's
pretend I'm a linebacker,

1227
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,409
and I'm gonna come at you
and try and block it.

1228
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:54,481
Okay-

1229
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:55,891
Set!

1230
00:50:57,079 --> 00:50:59,003
Hike! I'm a crazy linebacker!

1231
00:50:59,079 --> 00:51:00,047
Give me that football!

1232
00:51:00,159 --> 00:51:01,161


1233
00:51:01,519 --> 00:51:02,567



1234
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:04,324
on, my leg!

1235
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:05,639
Keithie!

1236
00:51:05,719 --> 00:51:07,722
Don't tell your mother!

1237
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:10,804
All right, that kid's dead.
Back to work.

1238
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:11,920


1239
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,445
Now, you remember how to do
a five-point turn, right?

1240
00:51:14,519 --> 00:51:15,601
Yeah.

1241
00:51:15,679 --> 00:51:17,568
Parallel park?
Yeah, yeah.

1242
00:51:17,639 --> 00:51:19,688
Hey, don't "yeah,
yeah" me, dumb-ass.

1243
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,250
You're precious cargo.

1244
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:23,163
Now, if you mess around
and get yourself killed,

1245
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,246
I'm gonna have to kill you.

1246
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,003
Look, Dad, I'm ready
for this, all right?

1247
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,449
You're late.

1248
00:51:30,679 --> 00:51:31,920
Hello, McKenzie.

1249
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,684
Hey, Wiley, how you feeling?

1250
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:37,923
Oh, just two years of this.

1251
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,083
And I still only have
40% feeling in my body.

1252
00:51:41,199 --> 00:51:43,123
Otherwise, I'm fine.

1253
00:51:43,199 --> 00:51:44,929
No, Rihanna's fine.

1254
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,525
You just teach driver's ed.

1255
00:51:47,679 --> 00:51:49,125
Get her done, son!

1256
00:51:49,199 --> 00:51:51,407
And remember
everything we talked about!

1257
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,719
Defensive driving!

1258
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:53,925
Stop at all yellows!

1259
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,001
Obey the laws!

1260
00:51:55,079 --> 00:51:56,126


1261
00:51:56,199 --> 00:51:57,360
DRIVER 1= You moron!

1262
00:51:57,519 --> 00:51:58,646
DRIVER 2= Look out!

1263
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:01,684
Be safe!
Don't do what I just did!

1264
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,641
MARCUS= Hey, officers,
you guys want to stick around

1265
00:52:04,719 --> 00:52:06,403
and have a drink with me,
hang out a little bit?

1266
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:07,561
You're afraid
of us leaving you

1267
00:52:07,719 --> 00:52:08,766
alone with your son,
aren't you?

1268
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:10,887
My son... Are you
kidding me? I don't care...

1269
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:11,960
Boo!

1270
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:13,081
He's got a knife!

1271
00:52:13,719 --> 00:52:16,849
That sounds dangerous.
How far was the drop?

1272
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:18,809
Just 35 feet.

1273
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,360
Who do you think
you are, Tarzan?

1274
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,329
It's no big deal.
Honey?

1275
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,164
Hi, {STAMMERING} Sally.

1276
00:52:25,239 --> 00:52:27,003
Hi, honey.
I... No, I just came to see

1277
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:28,201
if Mommy was alive.

1278
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:29,804
And looking now,

1279
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,166
she's breathing, she's good.

1280
00:52:31,239 --> 00:52:32,844
Hi. What are you doing here?

1281
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:35,007
I was bringing your mother
a new fan for the summer.

1282
00:52:35,079 --> 00:52:36,320
That's good.
You said you couldn't

1283
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,889
get coffee with
me because you had

1284
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:40,849
a 3=30 appointment
with a Mr. Renaldo.

1285
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,159
<i>Hello, ladies!</i>

1286
00:52:42,239 --> 00:52:43,844
<i>You!</i>

1287
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:44,920
<i>Can't be!</i>

1288
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,240
<i>We killed you. Last week.</i>

1289
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:50,766
<i>You actually think
two amateurish nitwits</i>

1290
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:54,083
<i>could kill The Great Renaldo?</i>

1291
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:55,771
I told you.

1292
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:58,922
You did. You called it.

1293
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:06,005
So the leg's not
really broken, huh?

1294
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:08,561
No, it is broken, right here.

1295
00:53:08,639 --> 00:53:11,324
Just a hairline fracture,
though.

1296
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,164
No, it's a clean break.

1297
00:53:13,239 --> 00:53:14,684
Slight, though.

1298
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:17,331
Slight? No. It's broken.

1299
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:20,085
Broken-broken or just broken?

1300
00:53:20,159 --> 00:53:22,731
It's a broken leg.

1301
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:26,407
What was once one bone
is now two half-bones.

1302
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:27,606
Right.

1303
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:32,288
Is there anything you can do
about my wife staring at me?

1304
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:36,726
No, I'm not a psychiatrist.

1305
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,369
So you're saying
my wife is crazy?

1306
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:40,010
No, no. I was joking.

1307
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:41,889
Like you were when you said
his leg is broken.

1308
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,610
Look, your son

1309
00:53:43,679 --> 00:53:46,922
is going to be wearing
that cast the entire summer.

1310
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,891
If you don't mind,
I haven't slept in 68 hours.

1311
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:53,246
So you're a little
loopy from lack of sleep,

1312
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:54,889
and that really
isn't my son's bone.

1313
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,922
That's a piece of
celery you snapped.

1314
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:57,967
ROXANNE= Lenny!
Yes?

1315
00:53:58,039 --> 00:53:59,565
The leg is broken!

1316
00:53:59,639 --> 00:54:03,121


1317
00:54:03,199 --> 00:54:04,929
You can't undo this,

1318
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,242
and you lied to me,
so you're gonna pay for it.

1319
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:12,927
Doctor, wouldn't it be nice
if there was a cure for anger?

1320
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,081
There is.

1321
00:54:14,159 --> 00:54:15,844
It's called Jack Daniel's.

1322
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,449
Another one of
your jokes, huh?

1323
00:54:18,519 --> 00:54:20,010
I Wish.

1324
00:54:22,639 --> 00:54:24,449
WILEY= Okay, the light is red
now, so just remain stopped.

1325
00:54:28,519 --> 00:54:30,045
Scully, is that you?

1326
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:33,166
Scully!

1327
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:36,603
Hey, what's up, fellas?

1328
00:54:36,679 --> 00:54:39,126
Are you taking your
driver's test drunk?

1329
00:54:39,199 --> 00:54:41,282
Yeah, I'm MC Hammered!

1330
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:43,010
Oh! You're a madman!
Psychopath, man!

1331
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:44,081
Hey, Scully, Scully.

1332
00:54:44,159 --> 00:54:46,400
Have you seen those old townies
from the quarry today?

1333
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:49,483
No, I can't say I did. Why?

1334
00:54:49,559 --> 00:54:51,641
They
disrespected our frat house!

1335
00:54:51,719 --> 00:54:53,244
Man, they disrespected
the crap out of it!

1336
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:54,889
Oh, no, can't have that.

1337
00:54:57,159 --> 00:54:58,445
Brewski time, dude!

1338
00:54:58,519 --> 00:54:59,965
It's not for you, Scully.

1339
00:55:00,039 --> 00:55:01,804
It's for that freak
in the hat next to you.

1340
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:03,005
Looks like he needs it.

1341
00:55:03,079 --> 00:55:04,081
Boom!
Yeah!

1342
00:55:04,159 --> 00:55:05,490
That just happened!

1343
00:55:05,559 --> 00:55:07,688
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

1344
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:13,485
Taking your driver's
test while intoxicated?

1345
00:55:15,079 --> 00:55:17,447
Minus five points.

1346
00:55:26,039 --> 00:55:27,643
This is ridiculous!

1347
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:31,367
I've wasted an entire day waiting
for this idiot to show up.

1348
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:34,125
Did you tell him your son-in-law
works for the cable company?

1349
00:55:34,199 --> 00:55:38,000
A fat lot of good being related
to that bozo would do me.

1350
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:41,050
I'm gonna run to the bathroom.

1351
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:42,690
Love to the children.

1352
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:50,525
Yes. Yes.

1353
00:55:57,119 --> 00:55:59,360
Damn it, I just sat down.

1354
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,521
I'll be right out there!

1355
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:02,681
Hang on!

1356
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:04,364
I'm coming as quick as I can.

1357
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:06,282
I got bunions, damn it!

1358
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,280


1359
00:56:14,039 --> 00:56:15,963
No! No!

1360
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:18,121

You burn in hell!

1361
00:56:18,239 --> 00:56:20,048
You cable-installing mother...

1362
00:56:20,119 --> 00:56:21,485
Oh, damn it!

1363
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:31,561
Look, man,

1364
00:56:31,639 --> 00:56:33,880
I know deadbeat dads
always have lame excuses

1365
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:36,166
why they don't see their kids,

1366
00:56:36,239 --> 00:56:39,686
but "I didn't know you existed
till about a week ago"

1367
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:41,807
is actually
a fantastic excuse.

1368
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:43,405
So can you cut me some slack?

1369
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:45,244
Her name's not Hiccups McGee.

1370
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:47,048
Yeah, I know that.

1371
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:48,724
So why do you call her that?

1372
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:51,365
No, that's just...
It's stupid.

1373
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:55,239
It's just kind of
a nickname I give people that,

1374
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:58,766
you know, have a distinct
trait or physical feature.

1375
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:02,322
Like, if someone had big lips,
you'd call them Lippy McGee.

1376
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,925
And if they sneezed a lot,
you'd call them Sneezy McGee.

1377
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,923
Oh, so you'd be Ugly McGee.

1378
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,161
I'd be Ugly McGee.
Exactly.

1379
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:11,565
Shorty McGee.

1380
00:57:11,639 --> 00:57:12,606
Shorty McGee, sure.

1381
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:13,920
Viagra McGee.

1382
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,331
Right, right.
You get it, you get it.

1383
00:57:15,559 --> 00:57:17,449
Listen, man,

1384
00:57:17,519 --> 00:57:20,090
I'm willing to give
this a try if you are.

1385
00:57:21,719 --> 00:57:24,451
You know what they say... Yesterday's
history, tomorrow's a mystery.

1386
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:28,681
Maybe we go inside
and search the Internet

1387
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:31,246
for funny videos of
squirrels waterskiing.

1388
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:34,530


1389
00:57:40,719 --> 00:57:42,927
Okay, we're
getting somewhere.

1390
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:45,289
ERIC= I'm sorry I lied
about the appointment.

1391
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:47,407
The lying's not
the worst part.

1392
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:49,561
You hid from me at your
mother's house, Eric.

1393
00:57:49,639 --> 00:57:50,971
Who does that?

1394
00:57:51,039 --> 00:57:52,565
Look, she's nice to me.

1395
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:55,041
You know,
she always takes my side,

1396
00:57:55,119 --> 00:57:58,043
worries if I'm eating enough
and taking my vitamins.

1397
00:57:58,159 --> 00:58:00,208
I do all that stuff,
too, Eric.

1398
00:58:00,599 --> 00:58:02,443
Okay, I don't.

1399
00:58:02,519 --> 00:58:03,806
You're right.

1400
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,483
You know, there's only
so many hours in a day,

1401
00:58:05,559 --> 00:58:08,166
and I'm always
running around the kids,

1402
00:58:08,239 --> 00:58:10,288
and I guess I
leave you out a lot,

1403
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:12,641
and I'm really gonna try harder
to make you feel special,

1404
00:58:12,719 --> 00:58:15,485
'cause you always make me feel
like the only girl in the world.

1405
00:58:15,559 --> 00:58:17,880
I feel bad.

1406
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:19,199
Don't feel bad.

1407
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:21,726
No, I do,
because today at the recital,

1408
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:26,123
I couldn't stop
looking at Becky's teacher.

1409
00:58:26,239 --> 00:58:27,969
I don't mind you looking.

1410
00:58:28,119 --> 00:58:30,121
I really don't.
Everybody looks.

1411
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:32,568
 I was
looking today.

1412
00:58:32,639 --> 00:58:34,528
And I'm totally
fine with that.

1413
00:58:34,599 --> 00:58:37,045
As long as he was gay,
dead or a cartoon.

1414
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:38,610
Gay.
Okay.

1415
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:41,047
But no matter who
or what we look at,

1416
00:58:41,199 --> 00:58:43,407
we'll always come back
to each other, right?

1417
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:46,851
Car wash!
Car wash! Whoo!

1418
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,405
Support our team!
I'll prove it to you!

1419
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:50,527
Car wash!

1420
00:58:50,599 --> 00:58:51,840
What are you doing?

1421
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:53,166
No,
no, you're gonna like this.

1422
00:58:53,719 --> 00:58:54,766
Hi, girls!

1423
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:58,489
ERIC= Come on.

1424
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:02,202
Honey,
you don't have to do this.

1425
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:03,246
I want to.

1426
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:05,208
Hi, girls!

1427
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,202
Wash it up extra soapy!

1428
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:09,202
You got it.


1429
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:11,567
Oh, wait, hang on. There's a
car just in front of you.

1430
00:59:11,639 --> 00:59:12,641
Better do them first.

1431
00:59:12,719 --> 00:59:13,766
Yo, got a customer!

1432
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:16,411
You take these guys,
we'll take the yellow car.

1433
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:18,527
Extra soapy.

1434
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,608
Oh, what is
happening right now?

1435
00:59:27,639 --> 00:59:30,166
I swear,
I didn't plan this.

1436
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,731
No,no,no,no. Thank you. I'm good.
I'm good, thank you.

1437
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:41,007
Well, I might as
well enjoy this.

1438
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:24,286
Why is this never-ending?

1439
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:27,329
At least the guys in the car
in front of us are having fun.

1440
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:42,239
What are you doing?
Get in there!

1441
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:43,650
Let me do it.

1442
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:52,369
LEN NY= Okay, everybody.

1443
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:55,250
It wasn't a perfect day. I admit it.
There were some downs.

1444
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:57,048
Sorry about the leg.

1445
01:00:57,119 --> 01:00:58,565
The good news is

1446
01:00:58,639 --> 01:01:00,688
the children got through
another year of school.

1447
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:01,847
Fabulously.

1448
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:04,844
You got older, even though I told you not to.
Especially you.

1449
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:06,684
Stay young. Don't leave me.

1450
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:10,161
You prepared us your famous
chicken ĂĄla food poisoning,

1451
01:01:10,239 --> 01:01:11,525
which we're all
excited to eat.

1452
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:14,045
 I'm just kidding.

1453
01:01:14,119 --> 01:01:16,360
But the greatest thing is, it's
my favourite part of the day

1454
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:17,565
with my four best friends.

1455
01:01:17,639 --> 01:01:18,925
To the Feders!

1456
01:01:19,079 --> 01:01:20,081


1457
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:23,610
So Bumpty asked me
out for ice cream today.

1458
01:01:23,679 --> 01:01:27,844
I "went out for ice cream"
once with your dad.

1459
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:31,128
Nine months later,
Andre popped out.

1460
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:36,400
This is the best
vanilla pudding I've ever had.

1461
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:38,766
That's butter, son.

1462
01:01:41,199 --> 01:01:42,360
Here you go.

1463
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:43,726
Oh, hey.

1464
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:45,045
Want me to come in
and feed it to you

1465
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:47,202
like I did the last time?

1466
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:49,521
No, no. I got my kid here.

1467
01:01:49,639 --> 01:01:50,721
That wouldn't be cool.

1468
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:53,201
You said you loved me!

1469
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:54,280


1470
01:01:54,519 --> 01:01:56,284
They're not all tens, buddy.

1471
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:57,440


1472
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:02,289
Homeboy,
why aren't you eating?

1473
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:05,045
I saw something today
that made me lose my appetite.

1474
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:07,851
What was it, me naked?

1475
01:02:09,639 --> 01:02:11,244
What?

1476
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:12,889
What's a burpsmart?

1477
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:14,085
Burpsnorp?

1478
01:02:14,159 --> 01:02:15,650
A burpsnart!

1479
01:02:15,719 --> 01:02:18,929
Basically, he burps, sneezes
and farts at the same time.

1480
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,047
He goes...

1481
01:02:20,119 --> 01:02:23,760


1482
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:25,771


1483
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:28,400
I think I just shat myself.

1484
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:31,244
Hey, honey, what time's
that Feder bash tonight?

1485
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:32,969
What?

1486
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:34,166
It's paint.

1487
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:35,650
It doesn't come off.

1488
01:02:35,719 --> 01:02:38,086
I thought it might be fun
to have a theme, no?

1489
01:02:38,159 --> 01:02:39,445
A theme?

1490
01:02:39,559 --> 01:02:40,766
Roxanne decided
the theme is...

1491
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:44,686
The '80s?

1492
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:46,807
That was 70 years ago.

1493
01:02:49,239 --> 01:02:50,923
I thought we could
go as Hall & Oates.

1494
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:51,967
Hall & Oates?

1495
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:53,126
Yeah.
Yeah.

1496
01:02:53,199 --> 01:02:55,009
What is that,
like a cereal?

1497
01:02:55,079 --> 01:02:56,525
No.

1498
01:02:56,599 --> 01:02:58,045
Why don't you
ask Nancy Arbuckle

1499
01:02:58,199 --> 01:02:59,610
to come by for
the get-together?

1500
01:02:59,679 --> 01:03:02,570
Or do you prefer
the imaginary shower version?

1501
01:03:02,639 --> 01:03:03,641


1502
01:03:04,159 --> 01:03:05,161


1503
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:07,766
You know what, Charlotte?
I trust you,

1504
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:09,523
and I want you to
have fun tonight.

1505
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:10,965
Really.

1506
01:03:11,039 --> 01:03:12,041


1507
01:03:14,119 --> 01:03:16,885
What's up, player?
I'm here for your daughter.

1508
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:23,206
What...

1509
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:25,891
Used to get 10 cases
of beer for my parties,

1510
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,570
now I get 10
cases of juice boxes.

1511
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:30,405
Hey, Beckster.

1512
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:32,164
Hey, Stud Muffin.
Hey.

1513
01:03:32,239 --> 01:03:35,561
Mommy calls him Stud Muffin,
so I call him Stud Muffin.

1514
01:03:35,639 --> 01:03:36,686
Is that right?

1515
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:39,331
You must be Roxanne's husband.
I'm Kyle.

1516
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:41,641
How do you know my wife
again there, Mud Stuffing?

1517
01:03:41,719 --> 01:03:43,563
I worked her out
this morning.

1518
01:03:43,639 --> 01:03:44,641
Oh, really?

1519
01:03:44,719 --> 01:03:47,326
I worked her out this morning,
too, pretty good.

1520
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:48,840
All right.

1521
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:50,842
Hi.

1522
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:52,045
What's up?

1523
01:03:52,119 --> 01:03:53,690
This is awkward.

1524
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:55,842
My husband's here.

1525
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:57,570
Why is that awkward?

1526
01:03:57,639 --> 01:03:59,324
Why?

1527
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:01,128
Well, let me give you a hint.

1528
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:04,807
You have brain damage?

1529
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:05,880


1530
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,367
I think we both know
what time it is, don't we?

1531
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:10,771
What time is it?

1532
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:12,842
Oh, nothing.

1533
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:16,766
It's just...
Just time to...

1534
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:18,523

Help me out here.

1535
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:21,570
I'm lost right now. I'm sorry.

1536
01:04:21,639 --> 01:04:23,528
Wiley,
how'd Andre McKenzie do?

1537
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:24,601
Did he pass his test?

1538
01:04:24,679 --> 01:04:26,125
He squeaked by.

1539
01:04:26,199 --> 01:04:28,327
We didn't check out
any soapy cheerleaders.

1540
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:30,083
What's going on
with you and my wife?

1541
01:04:30,159 --> 01:04:31,161
I'm gonna go.

1542
01:04:31,239 --> 01:04:32,570
Actually, why don't we all
go our separate ways.

1543
01:04:32,679 --> 01:04:34,920
I don't see any of these
conversations working out for me.

1544
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,364
Adios.
I'll see you tonight.

1545
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:37,407
Hey-

1546
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:38,641
I'll bring the Hubba Bubba.

1547
01:04:39,559 --> 01:04:40,641
What?

1548
01:04:40,719 --> 01:04:42,768
Yeah, party
tonight '80s-style, huh?

1549
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:44,648
<i>Rocky III.</i>

1550
01:04:44,719 --> 01:04:45,800
Wiley!

1551
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:46,967
Okay-

1552
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,764
Hey, babe.

1553
01:04:50,679 --> 01:04:51,965
What does Penny's note say?

1554
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:54,967
Uh...

1555
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:58,083
She wrote,
"Mayonnaise, zitis... "

1556
01:04:58,159 --> 01:04:59,400
The other side.

1557
01:05:02,159 --> 01:05:04,561
"Meet me by your
mailbox at 11=00."

1558
01:05:04,639 --> 01:05:07,007
Why would I meet her
by my mailbox at 11=00?

1559
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,320
You have any idea
what just happened there?

1560
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:15,686
Not a clue.

1561
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:18,161
DICKIE= I don't care who
your parents are.

1562
01:05:18,239 --> 01:05:19,844
You screw up, I fire you.

1563
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:22,047
It's all good.

1564
01:05:22,119 --> 01:05:23,166
"It's all good"?

1565
01:05:23,239 --> 01:05:25,481
It's a family restaurant,
not a rap show.

1566
01:05:25,559 --> 01:05:27,130
It's all bad?

1567
01:05:27,199 --> 01:05:29,088
That's right, it is.

1568
01:05:29,159 --> 01:05:30,525
You got a customer.

1569
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:33,603
I'm sorry. Welcome to
the Ice Cream House.

1570
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:35,329
Hi, Greg.

1571
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:37,208
Nancy, hi.

1572
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:40,045
I think you
crushed your cones.

1573
01:05:40,119 --> 01:05:41,280
Oh, no.

1574
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:42,771
That was a...
That was a squeeze test.

1575
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:44,489
These cones failed.

1576
01:05:44,519 --> 01:05:47,090
We're gonna try cardboard cones next.


1577
01:05:47,159 --> 01:05:48,240
You're smiling.

1578
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:50,284
And number two.

1579
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:52,362
You have such
a nice smile.

1580
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:54,123
Thanks.

1581
01:05:54,199 --> 01:05:57,123
Go out with me tonight before
your friends say I'm fugly.

1582
01:05:57,199 --> 01:05:59,282
Tonight?

1583
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:00,440
Sure.

1584
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:02,641
No freaking way.

1585
01:06:04,199 --> 01:06:06,885
Your father used to do
that same three-step crap

1586
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:08,291
when we were growing up.

1587
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:10,641
It always worked then.

1588
01:06:10,719 --> 01:06:12,528
Even on my wife.

1589
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:18,483
I ain't no boy with
a mind you can toy,

1590
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:21,483
'cause if this is a ploy,
I'll destroy Illinois.

1591
01:06:21,559 --> 01:06:24,324
It is so amazing how you can
freestyle like that.

1592
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:27,369
I been laying it down
truthful since day one.

1593
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:28,811


1594
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:33,409
Well, I sing sometimes, too,

1595
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:35,608
but only, like, in the shower.

1596
01:06:35,719 --> 01:06:37,688
I'm scared to sing in
front of other people.

1597
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:40,764
If you scared,
that means you don't got it.

1598
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:44,322
Sorry to be blunt, but I don't front.
I'm hard-core.

1599
01:06:45,079 --> 01:06:47,764


1600
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:49,483
Dinosaur!

1601
01:06:51,239 --> 01:06:53,527
How long ago was the '80s?

1602
01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:56,364
That was way
back in the 1900s.

1603
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:57,646
We learned about it in school.

1604
01:06:57,719 --> 01:06:58,766
It was wack.

1605
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:01,844
The phones had long, curly
things coming out of the end.

1606
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:03,570
You had to watch commercials.

1607
01:07:03,639 --> 01:07:04,721
No way.

1608
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:06,130
Isn't that right, Bowser?

1609
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:09,969
How we doing?

1610
01:07:10,039 --> 01:07:12,360
Hey, Dad, why do we have to
wear costumes and you don't?

1611
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:13,804
I am wearing a costume.

1612
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:16,610
Bruce Springsteen,
Born in the U. S.A.

1613
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:19,329
Who's Bruce Springsteen?

1614
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:21,367
I guess some guy
with a giant butt.

1615
01:07:21,559 --> 01:07:22,606
Ha.

1616
01:07:22,679 --> 01:07:24,568
You don't know
who the Boss is?

1617
01:07:24,639 --> 01:07:26,164
I stink as a father.

1618
01:07:26,239 --> 01:07:28,242
You do not stink as a father.

1619
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:30,163
You're the best father I know.

1620
01:07:30,239 --> 01:07:32,606
That's why I don't understand
why you don't...

1621
01:07:32,679 --> 01:07:33,726
Why I don't want a baby?

1622
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:36,280
Because I don't want one!
Let's move on from that!

1623
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:42,009


1624
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:45,920
Oh, no. No, no.

1625
01:07:46,039 --> 01:07:47,804
Tell her it wasn't
you talking, Dad.

1626
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:49,483
It was your flabby ass.

1627
01:07:49,559 --> 01:07:53,041
You want me to "accidentally"
break the other leg?

1628
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:02,246
Hey, I'm sorry
I raised my voice.

1629
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:03,923
In front of the children!

1630
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,570
Right, in front of the kids.

1631
01:08:05,639 --> 01:08:06,880
It's just, you...

1632
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:09,610
All you're doing is bringing up
this baby thing over and over.

1633
01:08:09,679 --> 01:08:11,170
Are you going through, like,

1634
01:08:11,199 --> 01:08:15,250
a "womany" hormone situation
or something? {GASPS}

1635
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:17,088
Menopause?

1636
01:08:17,159 --> 01:08:19,127
What, you're not old enough for that?
I'm sorry.

1637
01:08:19,239 --> 01:08:20,923
Okay, no,
I meant schizophrenia.

1638
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,287
No, honey, honey, honey,

1639
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:26,329
if we have another baby,
we're starting over, you know?

1640
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:27,890
How about we just adopt a kid?

1641
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:29,246
Like
a 20-year-old who has a job.

1642
01:08:29,319 --> 01:08:30,810
That way we could
make money off of him.

1643
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:32,360
Oh!

1644
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:35,768
I just... Don't you think we can
start concentrating on me and you?

1645
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:38,405
That's all I'm saying.
It's our time.

1646
01:08:38,479 --> 01:08:43,087
Well, lam going through
kind of a hormone thing.

1647
01:08:43,159 --> 01:08:45,447
Ah, good,
there's pills for that.

1648
01:08:47,079 --> 01:08:48,969
I'm pregnant.

1649
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:50,841


1650
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:51,921


1651
01:08:52,439 --> 01:08:54,408
Our guests are here.

1652
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:00,009
Wait a minute,
when did we even have...

1653
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:01,400
Oh.

1654
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:07,724
Damn you, Motel 6 hot tub!

1655
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:10,564
MARCUS= Wow.
Lenny, that's big, brother.

1656
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:12,164
Yeah, four kids is the best.

1657
01:09:12,239 --> 01:09:13,650
What are you
talking about, Prince?

1658
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:15,768
You told me it would be
the worst if that happened.

1659
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:17,847
There's a lot of
great aspects to that.

1660
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:21,527
Like, when Junior graduates
high school, you'll be 64.

1661
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:22,930
How is that a good thing?

1662
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,729
Actually, it's horrifying.

1663
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:26,722
I didn't do the math before
I opened my mouth. Sorry.

1664
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:28,881
Whoo. Nice job, Cher.

1665
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:30,006
Okay, I'm not Cher.

1666
01:09:30,079 --> 01:09:32,162
I'm Meat Loaf, all right?
Yeah.

1667
01:09:32,239 --> 01:09:34,527
You're Meat Loaf,
or you're made of meat loaf?

1668
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:36,283

Who are you, Doug Henning?

1669
01:09:36,399 --> 01:09:38,163
I'm Oates.

1670
01:09:38,239 --> 01:09:39,240
Where's Hall?

1671
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:41,680
Hall's having
a playdate with your kids.

1672
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:44,286



1673
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:46,847
Anyway, you got nothing
to worry about, Lenny.

1674
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:48,046
All right? You're a great dad.

1675
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:49,649
Right, I know.
I broke my son's leg today.

1676
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:50,881
That's a real good dad.

1677
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:52,291
Guys, you're
bumming me out, all right?

1678
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:53,640
This is supposed
to be party time.

1679
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:56,689
This isn't gonna be a real party.
I'm drinking a juice box,

1680
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:58,284
'cause I'm afraid my
wife's gonna yell at me

1681
01:09:58,439 --> 01:09:59,965
for getting drunk
in front of the kids.

1682
01:10:00,039 --> 01:10:03,248
How many of you guys have been to
a party in the past six months?

1683
01:10:03,359 --> 01:10:04,360


1684
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:06,288
A party without
a bouncy house.

1685
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:07,646


1686
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:09,609
A party where they
actually invited you.

1687
01:10:11,079 --> 01:10:12,161
Yeah.

1688
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:14,685
The party's over, fellas.

1689
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:16,807
You saw the way those frat
guys treated us today.

1690
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,244
We're irrelevant.

1691
01:10:18,319 --> 01:10:19,560
We're losers.

1692
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:20,686
We're old.

1693
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:22,125
Lamonsoff
totally surrendered.

1694
01:10:22,199 --> 01:10:24,042
He's got a fanny pack on now,
for God's sake.

1695
01:10:24,119 --> 01:10:25,770
You know what, first of all,

1696
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:28,411
it's a "survanny" pack,
a survival fanny pack,

1697
01:10:28,479 --> 01:10:29,845
with many special features.

1698
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:32,207
So you pull that triangle
and lasagna comes out?

1699
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:33,725


1700
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:35,211
Why don't you give it a shot?

1701
01:10:35,279 --> 01:10:37,487
You got it.
I'll pull the string.

1702
01:10:38,279 --> 01:10:39,930


1703
01:10:40,439 --> 01:10:42,521
<i>śśLike a raft out of hell! śś</i>

1704
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,887
Yeah, good one, that was good.

1705
01:10:46,319 --> 01:10:48,243
Don't ever say
the party's over!

1706
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:52,328
That didn't happen.

1707
01:10:56,199 --> 01:10:58,328
Hey,
Richard Simmons is a hero.

1708
01:11:16,319 --> 01:11:18,402
No,no,no,no,no.

1709
01:11:18,479 --> 01:11:19,685
What's with all this Prince?

1710
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:21,000
I'm Prince.
The hell.

1711
01:11:21,079 --> 01:11:22,411
You ain't Prince. I'm Prince.

1712
01:11:22,479 --> 01:11:24,083
My skin's way
lighter than yours.

1713
01:11:24,199 --> 01:11:27,090
You should have came as Seal on
a hunger strike. {BOTH CHUCKLE}

1714
01:11:27,159 --> 01:11:30,686
You look like Morgan Freeman
if he was a transvestite.

1715
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:32,046
And what you
doing here, Bumpty?

1716
01:11:32,159 --> 01:11:33,399
I thought you was
out with my daughter.

1717
01:11:33,479 --> 01:11:35,801
That ain't Bumpty.
That's my wife.

1718
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:38,530
Oh, Mary!
I didn't recognize you.

1719
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:39,886
Where's your costume?

1720
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:42,884
I didn't find out about the
party until it was too late.

1721
01:11:43,119 --> 01:11:46,043
So you decided to
come as a black Muppet?

1722
01:11:46,399 --> 01:11:48,766
What?

1723
01:11:49,399 --> 01:11:52,846
Come on, you're my one and
only, sweetie-boo-mo-mo.

1724
01:11:53,439 --> 01:11:55,646
Make a muscle for me?

1725
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:56,845
Pwease?

1726
01:11:58,239 --> 01:11:59,365
Ooh!

1727
01:11:59,439 --> 01:12:01,408
So bulgy.

1728
01:12:02,239 --> 01:12:06,324
Like a big caramel apple.

1729
01:12:10,079 --> 01:12:11,081


1730
01:12:16,319 --> 01:12:18,083
Wow.

1731
01:12:18,279 --> 01:12:21,921
I'm scared.
I feel safe with you.

1732
01:12:32,239 --> 01:12:33,923
Shut up.

1733
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:39,081
You know, I can make
a connection with a woman.

1734
01:12:39,159 --> 01:12:41,367
I just can't sustain it.

1735
01:12:41,439 --> 01:12:43,601
You know,
there's a distance there.

1736
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:47,885
Try to fill it up pharmaceutically,
you know, with pills,

1737
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:49,849
or the Discovery Channel,

1738
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:52,082
or Dino Nuggets.

1739
01:12:52,439 --> 01:12:54,123
But nothing really works.

1740
01:12:54,199 --> 01:12:57,443
See, you understand,
you know?

1741
01:12:57,560 --> 01:12:59,608
'Cause you're, I heard,

1742
01:13:00,079 --> 01:13:02,605
sensitive {CLEARS THROAT}
to men.

1743
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,411
God, he's hot!

1744
01:13:04,479 --> 01:13:06,720
Zip it!
He'll find out our secret!

1745
01:13:13,119 --> 01:13:14,167
Drink up, partner.

1746
01:13:14,319 --> 01:13:15,320
Yeah!

1747
01:13:15,399 --> 01:13:16,970
Lenny!

1748
01:13:17,079 --> 01:13:18,809
Uh-oh! Secret table.

1749
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:21,042
Yes, honey, how are you?
What's going on?

1750
01:13:21,119 --> 01:13:22,724
We just trying to
get our punch on.

1751
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:23,766
Becky's sleepy-

1752
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:25,887
She wants her daddy
to put her to bed.

1753
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:28,725
Well, Daddy's right about to
enjoy some refreshing punch,

1754
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:30,762
so could you put her to sleep?

1755
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:32,841
Well, you wouldn't want
to have too much punch

1756
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:35,240
with all these
kids running around.

1757
01:13:35,359 --> 01:13:36,850
You know what,
I'd be okay with that.

1758
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:38,251
Actually, you wouldn't.

1759
01:13:38,319 --> 01:13:39,685
Gotcha.

1760
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:42,604
I'll be back soon, fellas. I'll be back soon.
That's a promise.

1761
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:44,250
Let's go, little girl.
Good night.

1762
01:13:44,319 --> 01:13:45,480
Time to go to sleep.

1763
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:47,524
Close your eyes.

1764
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,364
Yeah, Mom.

1765
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,367
As easy as
making a free throw.

1766
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:00,726
Hey, Bean,
Becky went to sleep.

1767
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:03,451
I think it's time for you to hit it, pal.
What do you say?

1768
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:04,805
Oh, no, no, don't touch that.

1769
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:06,291
Yeah, you might break it.

1770
01:14:06,359 --> 01:14:08,442


1771
01:14:10,359 --> 01:14:12,043
What...

1772
01:14:12,119 --> 01:14:13,929
Where did you
learn how to do that?

1773
01:14:14,039 --> 01:14:15,804
I saw it in one of my dreams.

1774
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:22,926
You're a genius?

1775
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,287
My boy's a genius.

1776
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:29,087


1777
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:32,689
Your dad's also a genius.

1778
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:35,239
Sweet dreams there,
angel, okay?

1779
01:14:35,319 --> 01:14:38,448
Daddy, can you lay in bed
with me till I fall asleep?

1780
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:41,126
What do you mean? I thought you are sleepy.
That's why we came up here.

1781
01:14:41,199 --> 01:14:43,567
Please lay down.

1782
01:14:44,319 --> 01:14:45,320
Oh!

1783
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:48,119
I'll lay down with you, then.

1784
01:14:48,199 --> 01:14:51,328
I just... There's
a party going on, but...

1785
01:14:51,399 --> 01:14:52,970
Can you tell me a story?

1786
01:14:53,039 --> 01:14:54,644
Look who was in
the neighbourhood!

1787
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:57,922
Some of Lenny's friends
from the old J. Geils Band!

1788
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,286


1789
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:13,039
Daddy?

1790
01:15:13,159 --> 01:15:14,399
You don't want one slug?

1791
01:15:14,479 --> 01:15:15,845
No.

1792
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:18,082
I thought you liked
this stuff. Sorry.

1793
01:15:19,159 --> 01:15:22,208
All right.
I'll tell you a story.

1794
01:15:22,319 --> 01:15:28,202
Once upon a time,
there was a hand,

1795
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:31,802
and the hand
faced-raked the child.

1796
01:15:32,319 --> 01:15:35,563
Sleep!

1797
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:38,167
Slee...

1798
01:15:39,319 --> 01:15:41,083
Sleep!

1799
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:45,970
Boy, Feder's cranking his old rock
and roll records pretty loud.

1800
01:15:46,439 --> 01:15:48,283
Guess he's never
heard of neighbours.

1801
01:15:51,039 --> 01:15:52,279
Now, why you stopping here?

1802
01:15:52,479 --> 01:15:53,925
I need some air.

1803
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,161
You need some air?

1804
01:15:55,239 --> 01:15:56,479
We haven't even
gotten to the party yet.

1805
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:57,880
I would appreciate it

1806
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:00,280
if you would stop
trying to "manage" me.

1807
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:03,688
Word, word.

1808
01:16:04,199 --> 01:16:05,725
Want me to stay
and wait with you?

1809
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:09,770
I just want to be alone!

1810
01:16:11,359 --> 01:16:13,043
Yo, don't believe the hype.

1811
01:16:13,119 --> 01:16:15,122
Boy!

1812
01:16:24,279 --> 01:16:28,604
Daddy, I can't fall asleep
without Mr. Gigglesworth.

1813
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:31,081
You told me he would be okay.

1814
01:16:31,159 --> 01:16:33,162
He will be. I...

1815
01:16:33,239 --> 01:16:35,480
He just needs to rest
a little bit longer, okay?

1816
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:38,882
Please, Daddy.
I need to see him.

1817
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:43,320
He had a very rough day.

1818
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:48,088
But I'll get him for you,
because you need to see him.

1819
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:53,042
Doing leg lifts. I work
out when I can, you know?

1820
01:16:53,399 --> 01:16:54,925
Want some Daddy
candy right here?

1821
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,967
Why are you naked?

1822
01:16:57,039 --> 01:16:58,564
Global warming.

1823
01:16:59,079 --> 01:17:00,319
Why is this empty?

1824
01:17:00,399 --> 01:17:01,845
Where is Gigglesworth?
Hey, hey.

1825
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:04,969
I'm sorry, man.
Were you looking for this?

1826
01:17:05,039 --> 01:17:06,279
Why's he look good?

1827
01:17:06,359 --> 01:17:07,645
I sewed him.

1828
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:08,801
You sew?

1829
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:09,961
Where'd you learn how to sew?

1830
01:17:10,039 --> 01:17:11,121
Gay camp-

1831
01:17:11,199 --> 01:17:13,440
You went to gay camp?
You're gay?

1832
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:16,171
No, no. No, I mean, I'm gay,

1833
01:17:16,239 --> 01:17:18,810
but no, there's no such thing as
gay camp, man. It was a joke.

1834
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:20,689
I learned to sew from my dad,
who was a tailor.

1835
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:23,331
I've been sewing since
I was Becky's age. Here.

1836
01:17:23,479 --> 01:17:25,403
This is great.

1837
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:27,927
Gigglesworth's okay,

1838
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,207
you're not fooling
around with my wife,

1839
01:17:30,279 --> 01:17:31,520
and you got a pee stain.

1840
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:37,841
That is not mine.

1841
01:17:47,079 --> 01:17:49,082
You're an animal.

1842
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:57,770
I am the law!

1843
01:18:00,439 --> 01:18:01,965


1844
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:03,921
ALL= Oh!

1845
01:18:05,199 --> 01:18:06,201


1846
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:09,688
Can you dig it?

1847
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:20,520
Ah!

1848
01:18:21,119 --> 01:18:23,440
Come on, big man, Lenny's
got, like, 12 bathrooms.

1849
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:25,721
I don't got to go
to the bathroom.

1850
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:27,449
I'm just enjoying the water.

1851
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:29,927
WOMAN= Get out.

1852
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,605
Hurry! Hurry!

1853
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:34,363
Oh, Fluzoo, come on!

1854
01:18:34,479 --> 01:18:37,323
That's not even warm.
It's hot.

1855
01:18:42,319 --> 01:18:44,402
I got to give it to
your old man for one thing.

1856
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:47,289
He could always throw a party.

1857
01:18:47,359 --> 01:18:48,963
This is my dad's party?

1858
01:18:52,439 --> 01:18:55,488
DICKIE= Check out your girlfriend
in the Pat Benatar outfit.

1859
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:58,930


1860
01:18:59,119 --> 01:19:01,850


1861
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,684


1862
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,364
KURT= Charlotte,

1863
01:19:18,479 --> 01:19:19,765
that was amazing.

1864
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:21,251
Where'd you learn
to sing like that?

1865
01:19:21,359 --> 01:19:24,921
No place. I just sing a little
in the shower. {CHUCKLES}

1866
01:19:25,159 --> 01:19:27,480
Maybe you should stick to the shower.


1867
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:28,800
<i>śś'Cause I gots the power</i>

1868
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:31,326
<i>śśI'm on Today Show
Dissing Matt Lauer śś</i>

1869
01:19:31,399 --> 01:19:32,447
DEANNE= Bumpty!

1870
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:33,805
Do me a favour
and shut your mouth

1871
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:36,804
before I slap that
Mohawk into a chin strap.

1872
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:38,484
ALL= What?

1873
01:19:53,079 --> 01:19:54,319
LENNY= Hey.

1874
01:19:54,399 --> 01:19:56,448
Who invited you guys?

1875
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:58,881
Your beautiful wife does.

1876
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:00,166
Well, she invited her,

1877
01:20:00,239 --> 01:20:03,163
and naturally,
we assumed it was a plus one.

1878
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:04,801
There a problem?

1879
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:08,520
No, I was gonna say,
great Terminator outfit

1880
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:11,364
and Robert Palmer
thing you got on, and...

1881
01:20:11,439 --> 01:20:12,725


1882
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:14,404
Nice babble.

1883
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:16,970
DUFFY= How about this?
KEITHIE= No.

1884
01:20:17,079 --> 01:20:18,127
DUFFY= What about that?

1885
01:20:18,199 --> 01:20:20,362
Does that hurt?
Is that hurting you?

1886
01:20:20,439 --> 01:20:21,520
Yes, it is hurting me.

1887
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:24,331
Oh. Okay.
Well, let me do it some more.

1888
01:20:24,399 --> 01:20:26,686
You got something to say?

1889
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:28,449
LENNY= Actually, Cavanaugh.

1890
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:32,161
You want to stay at my party,
I think you owe me an apology.

1891
01:20:32,239 --> 01:20:33,240
For what?

1892
01:20:33,319 --> 01:20:36,210
For back in the day,
always giving me crap.

1893
01:20:36,479 --> 01:20:38,528
You don't want to
let bygones be bygones?

1894
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:41,809
I do.
After you apologize to me.

1895
01:20:42,239 --> 01:20:44,048
For stuff I did 30 years ago?

1896
01:20:44,119 --> 01:20:47,680
There isn't a statute of
limitations on being a dick.

1897
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:49,807
What'd you just say?

1898
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:51,722
I said what I said.

1899
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:53,847
You and me are
fighting right now.

1900
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:56,127
Now, let's go!
Let's get it over with.

1901
01:20:56,199 --> 01:20:57,645


1902
01:20:58,159 --> 01:21:00,527
Oh, man, looks like our
friend's about to die.

1903
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:02,488
Lenny, what's going on?
I'm calling the police!

1904
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:05,171
We're already here.

1905
01:21:05,319 --> 01:21:06,320


1906
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:09,246
Hold my hair, woman.

1907
01:21:10,119 --> 01:21:11,246
You ready for this?

1908
01:21:11,319 --> 01:21:14,085
Not at all,
but I'm gonna do this,

1909
01:21:14,159 --> 01:21:16,127
'cause I got to show
my son what's right.

1910
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:21,724
We'd do anything for
our boys, wouldn't we?

1911
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:23,211
Absolutely.

1912
01:21:23,279 --> 01:21:24,405
Yeah.

1913
01:21:24,479 --> 01:21:26,050
My boy's over in Afghanistan.

1914
01:21:26,119 --> 01:21:29,521
Well, you raised him right.
I hope he gets home safe soon.

1915
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:31,045
Yeah, me, too.

1916
01:21:31,119 --> 01:21:32,564
OFFICER DANTE=
Sucker-punch him, Feder.

1917
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:37,009
Lick his bicep. Lick it,
bite it, lick the tan off.

1918
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:40,688
All right,
here's what's gonna happen.

1919
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:43,444
Hit me right on the chin. I'll
go down like a sack of potatoes.

1920
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:44,600
What are you talking about?

1921
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:45,766
Just do it.

1922
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:48,319
I know you'd do the same for
me if my boy was watching.

1923
01:21:49,319 --> 01:21:51,162
Let's get busy, Hollywood!

1924
01:21:58,439 --> 01:21:59,885
No! Don't hit me, please!

1925
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:01,882
I'm sorry.
Please don't hit me.

1926
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:03,371
You would tear
me limb from limb.

1927
01:22:03,479 --> 01:22:04,765
Open this.

1928
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:06,079
The only reason
I picked on you

1929
01:22:06,199 --> 01:22:07,485
was because I
was afraid of you.

1930
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:08,970
What?
Oh, my God.

1931
01:22:09,039 --> 01:22:11,042
Please, please, please.
Just go with it.

1932
01:22:11,119 --> 01:22:13,407
I didn't think anyone would
believe you could knock me out.

1933
01:22:13,479 --> 01:22:17,279
Please. Don't hit me.

1934
01:22:17,359 --> 01:22:20,443
Cavanaugh's crying.
This is ridiculous!

1935
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:21,487
MAN= Cavanaugh.

1936
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:23,130
You mean you don't
want me to hit you with this?

1937
01:22:23,199 --> 01:22:24,201
No! Please.

1938
01:22:24,439 --> 01:22:26,488
Or the elbow?

1939
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:28,284
Finger in the eye!

1940
01:22:28,359 --> 01:22:30,248
Wow.
Listen to this guy!

1941
01:22:30,319 --> 01:22:33,846
All right, get up.
Straighten up.

1942
01:22:34,159 --> 01:22:35,969
I'm not gonna hit you,

1943
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:40,962
but if you ever disrespect me

1944
01:22:41,039 --> 01:22:42,849
or anybody,

1945
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:44,762
I will hunt you down,

1946
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:48,480
and I will slap you
into a pile of tattoos,

1947
01:22:49,039 --> 01:22:50,724
bad breath

1948
01:22:51,399 --> 01:22:52,480
and back zits.

1949
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:55,488
Oh, please.

1950
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:57,688
Do you understand me?

1951
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:59,524
Yes, I understand you.

1952
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:02,206
Do you understand me?

1953
01:23:02,279 --> 01:23:04,725
Yes, I understand you!

1954
01:23:05,079 --> 01:23:06,809
Then walk away
before I change my mind.

1955
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,291
Thank you very much.

1956
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:09,720


1957
01:23:14,039 --> 01:23:15,087
Hey, man, look at him!

1958
01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:16,167
What just happened?

1959
01:23:16,239 --> 01:23:18,162
ALL= Lenny! Lenny! Lenny!

1960
01:23:18,239 --> 01:23:21,483
Oh, my God, that was the
manliest thing you ever did.

1961
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:24,967
You get extra special
hip-hop dance tonight.

1962
01:23:25,039 --> 01:23:26,644
Word up.

1963
01:23:27,159 --> 01:23:30,243


1964
01:23:30,399 --> 01:23:32,528
Hey, guys, if you see Leonard,

1965
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:36,161
could you tell him that I'm
here waiting like we arranged?

1966
01:23:36,279 --> 01:23:38,009
GUYS? Guys?

1967
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:43,002
Yeah, okay.
Okay, lam a person!

1968
01:23:43,119 --> 01:23:45,042
ERIC= That was awesome, by the way.
Had to. Had to.

1969
01:23:45,119 --> 01:23:46,530
Yeah, yeah, you had to.

1970
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:48,203
He let you off the hook,
didn't he?

1971
01:23:48,279 --> 01:23:51,203
He did, he did,
but I had to go with it.

1972
01:23:56,760 --> 01:23:58,603
I can't believe it!

1973
01:23:58,720 --> 01:24:00,881
We hit the moron jackpot!

1974
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:05,248
Everybody who needs a beating,
conveniently together on one lawn.

1975
01:24:05,319 --> 01:24:06,810
Who are they?

1976
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:09,326
Brunson University frat guys.

1977
01:24:09,439 --> 01:24:12,171
Oh, God, I hate white people.

1978
01:24:12,279 --> 01:24:15,045
Excuse me, why are you here?
What's the matter?

1979
01:24:15,119 --> 01:24:18,168

I tell you what is the matter.

1980
01:24:18,279 --> 01:24:20,965
These old townies
trashed our frat house!

1981
01:24:21,039 --> 01:24:24,761
And nobody treats our good-times
headquarters with disrespect!

1982
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:26,887
ALL= Yeah!

1983
01:24:27,039 --> 01:24:29,963
They didn't do it.

1984
01:24:30,039 --> 01:24:31,404
Me do it.

1985
01:24:31,479 --> 01:24:33,766
Don't try and
cover for him, Z-Dog!

1986
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:35,324
Who's Z-Dog?

1987
01:24:35,399 --> 01:24:36,685
We know they're
trying to get back at us

1988
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:39,006
for making them do the naked
plunge in our swimming hole.

1989
01:24:39,079 --> 01:24:40,764
Your swimming hole?
I've been swimming

1990
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:42,564
at the quarry since I
was eight years old.

1991
01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:45,081
Apparently,
everybody in this crap town

1992
01:24:45,159 --> 01:24:47,970
has been swimming there since
they were eight years old.

1993
01:24:48,039 --> 01:24:50,042
I guess nobody
wants to leave this dump

1994
01:24:50,159 --> 01:24:52,162
because they're
too busy sucking!

1995
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:54,090


1996
01:24:57,640 --> 01:24:58,926
We'll finish later.

1997
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,444
You promise?
I promise.

1998
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:02,328
Okay.
BAILEY= Hey, smart guy!

1999
01:25:02,399 --> 01:25:04,561
Lenny Feder left this town,

2000
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:07,689
moved to Hollywood,
made big bucks,

2001
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:10,161
probably more money than
all you brainiacs put together

2002
01:25:10,239 --> 01:25:11,240
ever will.

2003
01:25:11,319 --> 01:25:12,525
But guess what?

2004
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:14,243
He came back here.

2005
01:25:14,319 --> 01:25:16,606
'Cause this
beautiful town is his home.

2006
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:19,041
And it always
will be his home.

2007
01:25:24,359 --> 01:25:28,364
Well, that was just a moving
testament to this community, bro!

2008
01:25:28,439 --> 01:25:32,604
But we didn't come here
to hear any lame speeches.

2009
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:37,287
We came here to kick
some old, smelly ass!

2010
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,287
Fellas, we may be old.

2011
01:25:45,399 --> 01:25:46,640
We may be smelly.

2012
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:48,721
We may have a penis.

2013
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:54,570
But the only ones getting
their ass kicked around here

2014
01:25:54,640 --> 01:25:57,529
is gonna be you spoiled,

2015
01:25:57,640 --> 01:26:01,530
privileged, uppity,
preppy D-bags.

2016
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:02,805
You hear that?

2017
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:05,280
Now, let's get busy!

2018
01:26:10,239 --> 01:26:12,242


2019
01:26:26,279 --> 01:26:27,485
<i>śśThey're
dancing on the ceiling</i>

2020
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:30,211

01:26:33,439 --> 01:26:36,523
<i>śśThey know there's

2023
01:26:46,119 --> 01:26:47,689
MARCUS= Come on, son!

2024
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:48,726
You ain't tough!

2025
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:50,244
Hit him!

2026
01:26:50,920 --> 01:26:55,368
Yeah, Braden!
Whoo! Yeah! Damn!

2027
01:26:55,479 --> 01:26:56,970
You want this?
Uh-oh!

2028
01:27:01,319 --> 01:27:02,605
Sir, please stop it!

2029
01:27:02,680 --> 01:27:04,921
That's not a sir!
That's a woman!

2030
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,127
My woman!

2031
01:27:07,239 --> 01:27:09,402
Come on, babe.

2032
01:27:09,479 --> 01:27:12,722
<i>śśI know you're
gonna lose control</i>

2033
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:14,039
<i>śśYou can do śś</i>

2034
01:27:14,119 --> 01:27:16,042
Oh, you're so hot.

2035
01:27:17,159 --> 01:27:18,161


2036
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:22,369
<i>śśI know it's cold outside śś</i>

2037
01:27:22,439 --> 01:27:24,442
Don't bust my face!

2038
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:26,489
You saved me.

2039
01:27:26,920 --> 01:27:28,159


2040
01:27:28,399 --> 01:27:31,688
I will protect you for
the rest of your life.

2041
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:34,842
Oh, okay, blow dryer boy.

2042
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,001


2043
01:27:38,319 --> 01:27:39,605
Oh, God, no!

2044
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:41,728
No! No!

2045
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:43,801
Yeah! Yeah!

2046
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:45,609
Having a good anniversary,
babe?

2047
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:47,011
Oh, honey, the best.

2048
01:27:47,640 --> 01:27:48,640


2049
01:27:50,439 --> 01:27:51,440


2050
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:52,930
I can't breathe.

2051
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,126
Choking me!

2052
01:27:54,199 --> 01:27:55,201


2053
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:05,926
Yeah!

2054
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,809
We did it. We did it, man.

2055
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:08,846
Yeah.

2056
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:10,364
We make a good team.

2057
01:28:10,439 --> 01:28:11,965
Yeah. Yeah, that was fun.

2058
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:28,801


2059
01:28:38,279 --> 01:28:40,646
<i>śśI know it's cold outside</i>

2060
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:43,564
<i>śśCome on, babe,
I'll keep you satisfied śś</i>

2061
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:44,765
Boomer!

2062
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:46,086
What's going on?

2063
01:28:46,159 --> 01:28:47,604
This!

2064
01:28:47,680 --> 01:28:50,489
You're a traitor, Boomer!

2065
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:51,765
His name's not Boomer!

2066
01:28:52,840 --> 01:28:54,126
Oh!
It's Gary.

2067
01:28:54,199 --> 01:28:55,360
It's Greg.

2068
01:28:55,439 --> 01:28:57,646
Oh, Greg.

2069
01:29:04,640 --> 01:29:06,961
Oh, my God!
Did you see his head?

2070
01:29:07,039 --> 01:29:08,769
He's got a... He's bald!

2071
01:29:08,920 --> 01:29:10,364
I got a wild one!

2072
01:29:10,439 --> 01:29:12,203
I got a wild one!
Whoo hoo hoo!

2073
01:29:14,079 --> 01:29:15,684
Noogie, noogie, noogie.

2074
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:17,807
Nobody noogies my brother!

2075
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:22,081
My brain! My brain!

2076
01:29:26,720 --> 01:29:28,484
B.U.!

2077
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:30,050
Hey, man! I had that one.

2078
01:29:30,119 --> 01:29:31,724
I know you did, big brother.

2079
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:32,766
Get out of here!

2080
01:29:32,840 --> 01:29:33,841
Don't hit me!

2081
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:36,884
Hey, hey, look who showed up.

2082
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:39,930
Flippy-boy. Yeah, you want to
flip your way out of this?

2083
01:29:41,279 --> 01:29:42,725
Too slow, old man.

2084
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:44,131
Where you work out, Cinnabon?

2085
01:29:47,279 --> 01:29:48,565
Look who's back up, baby.

2086
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:50,641
I didn't know we were kicking.
Give me a second to stretch.

2087
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:52,006
All right.

2088
01:29:52,079 --> 01:29:53,524
We're gonna
throw some legs, huh?

2089
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:55,283
You want to
throw some legs, huh?

2090
01:29:57,279 --> 01:29:59,122
Boom!

2091
01:29:59,199 --> 01:30:00,929
That just happened.

2092
01:30:01,720 --> 01:30:04,087
What,
were you raised by ninjas?

2093
01:30:05,560 --> 01:30:07,243
Congratulations.

2094
01:30:07,319 --> 01:30:08,320
You won the fight.

2095
01:30:08,399 --> 01:30:09,400
Here's your prize.

2096
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,001
Aw!

2097
01:30:11,079 --> 01:30:14,368
Thanks, little girl.
it looks just like you.

2098
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:18,684
It's a monkey!

2099
01:30:19,159 --> 01:30:20,286
Look at me!

2100
01:30:20,359 --> 01:30:23,329
I'm a stupid little monkey.

2101
01:30:27,399 --> 01:30:29,801
Good night.

2102
01:30:32,479 --> 01:30:34,641
Come on, guys!
We got to get out!

2103
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:36,085
Let's go!

2104
01:30:38,119 --> 01:30:39,884
Lenny! Baby.

2105
01:30:39,960 --> 01:30:41,724
Baby, are you all right?
I'm coming for you, Leonard!

2106
01:30:42,079 --> 01:30:43,081


2107
01:30:43,359 --> 01:30:46,250
I'm here for you, Leonard.
I'm here for you.

2108
01:30:46,319 --> 01:30:48,287
Who... Who are you?

2109
01:30:48,359 --> 01:30:49,885
It's your pretty, shiny Penny.

2110
01:30:51,880 --> 01:30:54,451
Oops, sorry,
I kicked your barrette.

2111
01:30:55,359 --> 01:30:57,043


2112
01:30:58,239 --> 01:31:00,402
Sorry, honey!

2113
01:31:02,359 --> 01:31:05,523
LENNY= You guys were Fuji
and Tanaka out there.

2114
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:07,011
This is just like high school.

2115
01:31:07,079 --> 01:31:10,970
Get drunk, get in a fight, wind up
back at Lamonsoff's, eating eggs.

2116
01:31:11,039 --> 01:31:13,042
Except for
the drunk part, Mommy.

2117
01:31:13,319 --> 01:31:14,320
Oh.


2118
01:31:15,359 --> 01:31:19,046
Oh, all you guys together
brings back so many memories.

2119
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:20,845
Whoa, Dickie,
is this you and Lenny?

2120
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:22,246
LENNY= Let's see.

2121
01:31:22,359 --> 01:31:24,521
Yeah, me and Hollywood were
best friends in kindergarten.

2122
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:25,886
Yep.
What happened?

2123
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,479
What do you mean, "What happened?"
We were in different classes.

2124
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:29,800
We kind of
drifted apart, right?

2125
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:32,082
Yeah. He was in
those smart classes.

2126
01:31:32,159 --> 01:31:33,649
I was in the other classes.

2127
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:34,720


2128
01:31:36,279 --> 01:31:37,645
Hey, who's this guy?

2129
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:39,603
Anybody remember him?
LENNY= Who is that?

2130
01:31:39,720 --> 01:31:40,845
Wow,
what happened to that kid?

2131
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:42,159
He's still here.

2132
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:47,886
Why do I know my new kid's gonna
end up looking like that?

2133
01:31:47,960 --> 01:31:49,086
You're having a baby, Lenny?

2134
01:31:49,199 --> 01:31:50,326
Yeah.

2135
01:31:50,439 --> 01:31:51,930
Yeah, so I'm told,
Mrs. Lamonsoff.

2136
01:31:52,079 --> 01:31:53,729
Oh, a surprise, huh?

2137
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:55,164
Yes.

2138
01:31:55,279 --> 01:31:58,841
People today try to
plan things out so much.

2139
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:02,128
But don't think an unexpected
child is loved any less

2140
01:32:02,199 --> 01:32:04,440
than one you planned for.

2141
01:32:05,079 --> 01:32:06,729
Someday, Lenny,
you won't even remember

2142
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:08,524
what life was like
with just three children.

2143
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:11,802
You think we wanted Eric?


2144
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:13,409
He was an accident.
Mama.

2145
01:32:13,479 --> 01:32:16,609
His father and I were in the
men's room at a Patriots game...

2146
01:32:16,680 --> 01:32:18,841
You know what, I think I'm
just gonna turn the page here.

2147
01:32:18,920 --> 01:32:21,002
I'm turning the page.

2148
01:32:21,079 --> 01:32:22,524
Finish the story!

2149
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:36,162
Officer Dante's
passed out on our lawn.

2150
01:32:36,239 --> 01:32:39,766
I know. I saw him
trying to arrest an anthill.

2151
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:40,841


2152
01:32:42,840 --> 01:32:44,921
Want to talk about
the whole pregnancy thing?

2153
01:32:47,039 --> 01:32:48,087
Mmm.

2154
01:32:48,159 --> 01:32:50,002
It's okay.
We'll talk tomorrow.

2155
01:32:50,079 --> 01:32:51,319
Okay-

2156
01:32:51,399 --> 01:32:54,721
Okay, you go to sleep. I'll make
this between me and the baby.

2157
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:57,881


2158
01:33:02,159 --> 01:33:04,162
Hello in there.

2159
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:06,210
This is your daddy speaking.

2160
01:33:08,039 --> 01:33:11,328
I just want to tell you
welcome to the family,

2161
01:33:11,399 --> 01:33:14,846
and I love you very,
very, very much.

2162
01:33:15,159 --> 01:33:19,006
I really don't care if
you're a boy or girl.

2163
01:33:19,960 --> 01:33:22,930
I just need you to
promise me one thing.

2164
01:33:23,359 --> 01:33:27,159
When you're in elementary
school, study ballet,

2165
01:33:27,239 --> 01:33:29,925
so I can see that teacher
as much as possible.

2166
01:33:30,319 --> 01:33:31,287
Hey-

2167
01:33:31,359 --> 01:33:33,283
I knew that was coming.

2168
01:33:35,199 --> 01:33:38,726
To be honest, I don't need
no stinking ballet teacher.

2169
01:33:39,039 --> 01:33:41,850
I'm married to the most
beautiful woman in the world,

2170
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:43,206
your mommy.

2171
01:33:43,880 --> 01:33:45,529
Are you saying
sweet things to me

2172
01:33:45,680 --> 01:33:47,363
because you want
to fool around?

2173
01:33:47,640 --> 01:33:50,404
That would be a nice way
to kick off the summer.

2174
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:53,649
Okay, Mr. Romantic.

2175
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,764
But let's do this quick,

2176
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:57,682
we have a big
day tomorrow, okay?

2177
01:33:57,760 --> 01:33:58,966
Absolutely.

2178
01:33:59,039 --> 01:34:00,804
Watch your head in there.

2179
01:34:01,039 --> 01:34:02,041


2180
01:34:04,079 --> 01:34:05,081
LENNY; Whoo!

2181
01:34:05,880 --> 01:34:06,881


2182
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:09,280
Hang on.
Hang on. I'm sorry, honey.

2183
01:34:09,359 --> 01:34:12,569
Don't move. Don't move.
Oh, my God, I'm going to!

2184
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:15,001


2185
01:34:15,079 --> 01:34:19,721
I did it! I burpsnarted! Yes!

2186
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:21,489
ROXANNE= Lenny, grow up!

2187
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:23,926
LENNY= I did it for the baby!

2188
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:27,088
